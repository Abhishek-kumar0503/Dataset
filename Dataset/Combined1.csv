"  On one hand, some elderly drivers may have health conditions or medication side effects that can impair their vision, hearing, reaction time, or judgment12. These factors can increase the risk of being involved in a crash or injuring themselves or others. Reapplying for a license could help identify and address these issues and ensure that elderly drivers are fit to drive safely.  On the other hand, many elderly drivers are still capable and responsible drivers who value their independence and mobility1. Driving helps them stay connected to their family, friends, and community. Reapplying for a license could be seen as a form of age discrimination or an unnecessary burden. Moreover, some studies suggest that elderly drivers are not more dangerous than other age groups. For example, according to the BBC, drivers aged 75 and over make up 6% of all license holders but account for just 4.3% of all deaths and serious injuries3.  I think that a possible solution could be to have a periodic assessment of driving skills for all drivers, regardless of age. This could help ensure that everyone who drives on the road meets the same standards and criteria. It could also help drivers of any age improve their driving habits and learn new techniques or technologies. This way, no one would feel singled out or discriminated against based on their age alone.  ",0
" Some people agree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it promotes violence. They argue that:  Television violence can influence people to become violent and take drugs in the future12. Television violence can desensitize people to real-world violence and make them more accepting of it3. Television violence can affect children’s development and behavior, especially if they identify with aggressive characters or perceive the violence as realistic43. Television violence can increase the risk of aggression and criminality in adulthood, especially for males45. Some people disagree that television violence has a negative effect on society because it does not promote violence. They argue that:  Television violence is not the only or the main cause of violence in society. There are many other factors that contribute to violence, such as poverty, family problems, mental health issues, etc. Television violence can have positive effects on society, such as providing entertainment, catharsis, education, or social awareness. Television violence can have no effect on society, as people can distinguish between fiction and reality and are not influenced by what they see on TV. Television violence can vary in its content, context, and quality, and not all types of TV violence have the same impact on society. In conclusion, there are valid arguments and evidence for both sides of the debate. However, it is important to be aware of the potential effects of television violence on society and to use critical thinking and media literacy skills when watching TV. It is also important to monitor and limit children’s exposure to TV violence and to provide them with alternative sources of entertainment and education.   ",0
"  Some of the pros of animal testing are:  Animal testing contributes to life-saving cures and treatments. Many medical breakthroughs in the last 100 years have resulted from research using animals, such as vaccines, antibiotics, cancer therapies, organ transplants, and more12. Animal testing is crucial to ensure that vaccines are safe. Especially during the 2020 global pandemic, scientists needed to test on genetically modified mice to prevent vaccine enhancement, a situation where a vaccine makes the disease worse in some people12. There is no adequate alternative to testing on a living, whole-body system. Animals are similar to humans in many ways and can provide insights into complex biological processes that cannot be replicated by cell cultures or computer models12. Some of the cons of animal testing are:  Animal testing is cruel and inhumane. Animals suffer from pain, distress, and death during experiments, and many procedures involve toxicity tests, burns, infections, mutilations, and other harmful interventions12. Animal testing is not always relevant or reliable. Animals are different from humans in many aspects, such as anatomy, physiology, genetics, and metabolism, and therefore may not produce accurate or generalizable results for human health12. Animal testing is expensive and wasteful. It costs a lot of money and resources to breed, house, feed, and experiment on animals, and many animals are killed or discarded after being used. There are also other methods available that can replace or reduce animal testing, such as human tissue cultures, artificial organs, computer simulations, and microdosing12. My personal opinion is that animal testing should be minimized as much as possible and only used when there is no other viable option. I think that animals have rights and deserve respect and compassion, and that we should not cause them unnecessary harm or suffering. I also think that animal testing is not always reliable or relevant for human health, and that we should invest more in developing alternative methods that are more ethical and efficient. However, I also acknowledge that animal testing has contributed to many important medical advances that have saved lives and improved well-being for both humans and animals. I think that animal testing should be regulated by strict laws and guidelines that ensure the welfare of animals and the validity of scientific results. I think that animal testing should be a last resort when there is a clear need and benefit for human or animal health.              ",0
"  Field trips are an important part of the educational experience for students. They provide opportunities for learning, exploration, and fun that cannot be replicated in the classroom. Cancelling all field trips for the remainder of the year would deprive students of these benefits and negatively affect their motivation and performance. Therefore, I urge the principal to reconsider this decision and allow students to continue attending field trips.  First of all, field trips enhance the curriculum by exposing students to real-world situations and applications of what they learn in school. For example, visiting a museum can help students appreciate history and culture, while visiting a farm can help students understand biology and ecology. Field trips also allow students to interact with experts and professionals in different fields, such as scientists, artists, or journalists, who can inspire them and answer their questions. These experiences can broaden students’ horizons and spark their curiosity and interest in various subjects.  Secondly, field trips foster social and emotional skills that are essential for students’ development. By going on field trips, students can practice communication, collaboration, and problem-solving with their peers and teachers. They can also develop empathy, respect, and tolerance for people from different backgrounds and perspectives. Field trips can also help students cope with stress and anxiety by offering them a break from the routine and a chance to have fun and relax. These skills can improve students’ well-being and academic success.  Finally, field trips create memorable and meaningful moments that students will cherish for a long time. Field trips can stimulate students’ imagination and creativity by exposing them to new sights, sounds, and sensations. They can also create a sense of wonder and excitement that can motivate students to learn more and pursue their passions. Field trips can also strengthen the bond between students and teachers by allowing them to share common experiences and emotions. These moments can enrich students’ lives and make them appreciate the value of education.  In conclusion, field trips are a vital part of the educational process that should not be cancelled. They offer numerous benefits for students’ learning, growth, and happiness that cannot be replaced by any other activity. I hope the principal will reconsider this decision and allow students to continue enjoying field trips for the remainder of the year.            ",0
"  Climate change is a global issue that affects everyone and everything on our planet. It’s caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods.  The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and devastating. They include rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities and island nations, loss of biodiversity as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions, and food and water shortages that could lead to conflict and displacement.  But there is hope. By taking action now to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and transition to clean energy sources like wind and solar power, we can slow down the effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.  There are many ways you can get involved in the fight against climate change. You can reduce your own carbon footprint by driving less, eating a plant-based diet, and using energy-efficient appliances. You can also support policies that promote clean energy and protect natural resources.  I hope this essay has convinced you of the importance of taking action on climate change. Together, we can make a difference!            ",0
"  This is a complex and controversial topic that has no definitive answer. Different parents may have different views and preferences on how to raise their children and teach them financial responsibility. However, based on the information I found online, here are some possible pros and cons of giving children an allowance:  Pros:  It can teach children the value of money and how to budget, save and spend wisely1234. It can give children a sense of autonomy and independence to make their own choices123. It can motivate children to do well in school or complete chores if the allowance is tied to performance or behavior14. It can foster financial literacy and prepare children for the real world15. Cons:  It can create a sense of entitlement or dependency on parents for money623. It can reduce the intrinsic motivation or enjoyment of learning or doing chores if the allowance is seen as the only reward623. It can lead to poor spending habits or conflicts if parents have no control or guidance over how the allowance is used613. It can emphasize too much on the money aspect of an allowance and neglect other values or skills65. Ultimately, parents should do what they think is best for their children and their family situation. Some possible tips to make an allowance more effective are125:  Set clear rules and expectations for how the allowance is earned, given and used. Involve children in the decision-making process and explain the reasons behind the allowance system. Be consistent and fair with the allowance amount and frequency. Encourage children to save, invest or donate a portion of their allowance for long-term goals or causes. Review and adjust the allowance system as children grow older or circumstances change.           ",0

"  This is a complex and controversial topic that has many arguments for and against it. I will try to summarize some of the main points from both sides, but I encourage you to do your own research and form your own opinion.  Some of the pros of single-sex schools are:  They may reduce distractions and peer pressure from the opposite gender, especially during adolescence. They may allow teachers to use gender-specific teaching methods and tailor the curriculum to the needs and interests of their students. They may foster more confidence and leadership skills among girls and boys, who can see themselves as role models and achievers in various fields. They may challenge gender stereotypes and expectations, and encourage students to explore a wider range of subjects and activities. Some of the cons of single-sex schools are:  They may not prepare students well for the real world, where men and women work and interact together in diverse settings. They may reinforce gender segregation and discrimination, and limit the opportunities for social and emotional development of students. They may be based on questionable assumptions about natural differences between males and females, which may vary depending on individual factors and environmental influences. They may ignore or exclude students who do not fit into the binary categories of male or female, or who identify as transgender or non-binary. These are some of the pros and cons of single-sex schools, based on the information I found in 1234. However, there may be other factors to consider, such as the quality of the school, the availability of resources, the preferences of the parents and students, and the legal and ethical implications of single-sex education. Ultimately, the best choice depends on what works best for each student and their educational goals.🎓        ",0

"  Watching TV is a common pastime for many people, especially in the evenings. It can be entertaining, informative, and relaxing. However, watching too much TV can also have negative effects on our health, well-being, and cognitive abilities. In this essay, I will argue that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time engaging in other activities that are beneficial for our mind and body.  One of the main reasons why watching too much TV is bad for us is that it can increase our risk of developing various chronic diseases. According to a study by Johns Hopkins University1, excessive TV viewing can lead to reduced amounts of gray matter in the brain, which is responsible for mental processing. This can impair our memory, attention, and decision-making skills. Moreover, watching too much TV can also raise our blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels, which can contribute to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes2. A study by Harvard Health3 found that people who watched more than four hours of TV a day had a 49% higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than those who watched less than two hours.  Another reason why watching too much TV is harmful is that it can disrupt our sleep patterns and quality. Sleep is essential for our physical and mental health, as it helps us repair our tissues, regulate our hormones, and consolidate our memories. However, watching TV before bed can interfere with our natural circadian rhythms and melatonin production, which are responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycle2. The bright light and stimulating content of TV can also keep us awake and alert, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, mood swings, impaired concentration, and lower immunity.  A third reason why watching too much TV is detrimental is that it can reduce our social interaction and engagement with the world. TV can be a source of entertainment and information, but it can also isolate us from our family, friends, and community. Watching TV can take away time and opportunities for meaningful conversations, shared activities, and emotional support. It can also limit our exposure to diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences. Furthermore, watching too much TV can make us passive consumers of information and entertainment, rather than active participants in learning and creating. TV can also influence our attitudes, values, and behaviors in negative ways, such as promoting violence, stereotypes, consumerism, and unrealistic expectations.  Therefore, I believe that we should spend less time in front of the TV and more time doing other things that are good for our health and happiness. Some examples of alternative activities are:  Reading books or magazines that stimulate our imagination and curiosity. Playing games or puzzles that challenge our brain and improve our cognitive skills. Exercising or doing sports that strengthen our muscles and cardiovascular system. Meditating or doing yoga that relax our mind and body. Cooking or gardening that enhance our creativity and sensory awareness. Volunteering or joining clubs that expand our social network and contribute to society. By reducing our TV time and increasing our involvement in these activities, we can improve our physical and mental well-being, as well as enrich our lives with more joy and meaning.      ",0

"  The question of what age is appropriate for driving is a complex one that involves various factors, including physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. On the one hand, younger drivers may have faster reflexes and better vision, but they may also be more impulsive, inexperienced, and prone to risky behavior. On the other hand, older drivers may have more experience, but they may also have slower reaction times, decreased vision, and other age-related health issues.  Different countries and states have different laws regarding the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license. For example, in some European countries, the minimum age is 18, while in the United States, it varies from 14 (with restrictions) to 16 to 18, depending on the state. In some countries, the age limit also varies based on the type of vehicle, such as motorcycles, trucks, or buses.  The decision of what age is appropriate for driving ultimately depends on balancing the risks and benefits, as well as the cultural and social norms of a particular society. It also requires considering various factors, such as the quality of driver education and training, the availability of public transportation, and the prevalence of car accidents and fatalities.  In summary, there is no easy answer to the question of what age is appropriate for driving. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of various factors. Ultimately, the decision of what age to allow people to drive should be based on a balance of safety, practicality, and individual rights and responsibilities.    ",0
"  On one hand, those who support targeted searches argue that schools have a duty to maintain a safe environment for students and staff. They believe that targeted searches of lockers and backpacks are necessary to prevent violent incidents and drug use on school grounds. For example, if a student is found to be in possession of a weapon or drugs, it could potentially prevent a tragic event from occurring.  On the other hand, those who oppose targeted searches argue that they violate students' constitutional right to privacy. They believe that students have the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and that school officials should not have the authority to search students without a warrant or probable cause. Additionally, opponents argue that targeted searches can be discriminatory and may disproportionately target certain students based on their race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status.  There are valid points on both sides of the argument. However, it's important to note that the Supreme Court has ruled that school officials can search students' persons and property when they have reasonable suspicion to suspect weapons or drugs. This means that school officials must have a specific reason to suspect that a student is in possession of contraband before conducting a search.  Ultimately, schools should strive to strike a balance between ensuring the safety of their students and respecting their constitutional rights. This could be achieved through clear policies and procedures regarding targeted searches, as well as ongoing education and training for school officials on how to conduct searches in a respectful and non-discriminatory manner.

"  Habits are an integral part of our daily lives, and while some habits are healthy and productive, others can be harmful to our well-being. Whether it is a physical, emotional, or financial habit, it is important to recognize the negative impact it has on our lives and take steps to break it. In this essay, I will convince readers to break the habit of smoking, which is not only detrimental to physical health but also has a significant financial cost.  Smoking is one of the most harmful habits that an individual can develop, and it is also one of the most addictive. Smoking damages nearly every organ in the body and is responsible for a wide range of health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and many more. Not only does smoking have a significant impact on physical health, but it also affects the emotional well-being of the individual, leading to anxiety, depression, and stress.  One of the primary reasons to quit smoking is the financial cost associated with it. The cost of cigarettes continues to rise, and the habit can quickly become a drain on one's finances. In addition to the cost of cigarettes, there are also numerous hidden costs associated with smoking, including health care expenses, higher insurance premiums, and lost productivity due to illness. By quitting smoking, individuals can save money and use those funds for more important things such as education, travel, or investing for the future.  Another important reason to quit smoking is to improve overall physical health. Smoking damages the respiratory system, making it difficult for the individual to breathe and perform daily activities. Quitting smoking can improve lung function, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, and increase overall life expectancy. Additionally, quitting smoking can improve the appearance of the skin, teeth, and nails, and reduce the risk of developing wrinkles and other signs of aging.  Finally, quitting smoking can have a positive impact on emotional well-being. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance that alters the brain's chemistry, leading to feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress. By quitting smoking, individuals can break the cycle of addiction and improve their emotional state, leading to greater feelings of happiness, confidence, and well-being.  In conclusion, smoking is a harmful habit that can have a significant negative impact on physical, emotional, and financial health. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the negative effects of smoking and take steps to break the habit. By quitting smoking, individuals can improve their physical health, save money, and experience greater emotional well-being. It is never too late to quit smoking, and the benefits of doing so are well worth the effort.    ",0
"  Advocates of mandatory military service argue that it promotes patriotism, civic duty, and a sense of responsibility among citizens. Serving in the military can also provide valuable life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Furthermore, mandatory service can create a more diverse military by drawing in individuals from different backgrounds and social classes.  On the other hand, opponents of mandatory military service argue that it violates individual freedom and autonomy. Serving in the military can be physically and emotionally demanding, and not everyone may be suited for it. Additionally, mandatory service may disproportionately affect marginalized communities who may not have the same access to resources and opportunities as other groups.  It's also worth noting that the United States has an all-volunteer military, which has been in place since the end of the Vietnam War. Supporters of this model argue that it allows individuals to freely choose whether or not to serve, which aligns with the country's principles of individual liberty and freedom.  Ultimately, whether or not to institute mandatory military service is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors.  ",0
"  As an AI language model, I don't have a physical presence to travel, but I do have access to vast amounts of information about various places around the world. One place that I believe is very meaningful and rewarding to visit is the ancient city of Petra, located in Jordan.  Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It is a city carved out of rock, dating back to the 3rd century BC, and was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom. The city was lost to the world for centuries and was only rediscovered in the early 19th century.  The main attraction in Petra is the Treasury, a stunning temple carved into the rock face, which is believed to have been used as a tomb for a Nabataean king. The Treasury is one of the most iconic images of Petra and has been featured in many movies and TV shows. Visitors can also explore the many other temples, tombs, and monuments in the city, including the Monastery, which is reached by climbing a series of steep steps.  Aside from the incredible architecture, Petra also has a rich history and culture. The Nabataeans were skilled traders and controlled the spice and incense trade routes between Arabia and the Mediterranean. The city's location at the crossroads of these trade routes made it a hub of cultural exchange, and visitors can still see evidence of the diverse cultures that passed through the city.  Moreover, Petra is located in a beautiful and rugged landscape. The city is surrounded by mountains and canyons, which offer a range of hiking opportunities, from easy walks to challenging treks. Visitors can also explore the Wadi Rum desert, which is located nearby and is famous for its stunning sandstone formations and Lawrence of Arabia connections.  Visiting Petra is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed. It offers a unique combination of history, culture, architecture, and natural beauty that is unparalleled. Whether you are a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or an adventurer, Petra has something to offer everyone. So, if you are planning a trip to Jordan, make sure you include Petra in your itinerary. It will be a trip you will never forget.       ",0
"  On the one hand, computer communication can help shy people express themselves more freely and confidently, as they have more time to think about what they want to say and can revise their messages before sending them. This can be especially beneficial in work settings, where people may need to communicate with colleagues or clients they have never met in person.  On the other hand, relying too much on computer communication can hinder our ability to develop interpersonal skills and form meaningful relationships. For example, when we communicate in person, we can pick up on nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language, which can help us better understand the emotions and intentions of the other person. These nonverbal cues are often lost or misinterpreted in computer communication, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.  Moreover, computer communication can be impersonal and isolating, as it lacks the warmth and intimacy of face-to-face interaction. When we communicate in person, we can share experiences and emotions more deeply, which can create stronger bonds and foster more meaningful relationships.  Therefore, I believe that computer communication can be a useful tool, but it should not be relied on exclusively. We should strive to balance our use of technology with face-to-face interaction, as this can help us develop interpersonal skills, build stronger relationships, and enhance our overall well-being.

"  From a societal point of view, paternity leave policies can have several advantages. Firstly, they promote gender equality by recognizing the importance of fathers' role in raising children. Secondly, they allow fathers to bond with their newborns, which can strengthen the parent-child relationship and benefit the child's emotional and cognitive development. Additionally, paternity leave can also reduce the burden on mothers who may otherwise have to take care of the newborn on their own.  On the other hand, some people argue that paternity leave policies could have negative consequences for employers. For example, they could increase the cost of labor or decrease productivity if a critical employee is absent. Moreover, some argue that paternity leave policies could lead to discrimination against men, particularly if they are seen as less committed to their careers.  Overall, it's important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of paternity leave policies and consider the long-term impact they may have on society, families, and businesses.         ",0
"  Advocates of GMO labeling argue that consumers have a right to know what they are eating and to make informed choices about the foods they purchase. Without clear labeling, it is difficult for consumers to avoid GMOs if they wish to do so. Labeling would also provide transparency in the food industry, allowing consumers to hold companies accountable for their ingredients and production methods.  Additionally, some consumers are concerned about potential health and environmental risks associated with GMOs, and labeling would allow them to avoid products that contain these ingredients. This would also help address concerns about the long-term effects of GMOs on human health and the environment.  Opponents of GMO labeling argue that it would be costly and impractical for manufacturers to implement such a system. They also argue that there is no evidence that GMOs are harmful to human health or the environment, and that labeling would only stigmatize these products unfairly.  Furthermore, GMO labeling could create confusion and mistrust among consumers, leading them to avoid products that are safe and nutritious. For example, some products, such as papayas and soybeans, are genetically modified to resist disease and pests, making them safer and more sustainable than their non-GMO counterparts.  In conclusion, the debate over GMO labeling is complex and multifaceted, with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision to require labeling should be based on a thorough examination of the scientific evidence and a consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks for consumers, manufacturers, and the environment.

"  Advocates of genetically modified foods argue that they can have significant benefits for food production, such as increasing crop yields, reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides, and enhancing nutritional value. For example, genetically modified crops can be engineered to be more resistant to pests and diseases, which reduces the need for harmful chemical sprays. This can lead to increased crop yields and lower production costs, which can ultimately translate into more affordable food for consumers.  However, opponents of genetically modified foods argue that there are potential risks associated with them, including environmental concerns and health risks. For example, there are concerns that genetically modified crops could cross-pollinate with non-modified crops and introduce unwanted traits, potentially harming biodiversity. Additionally, some studies have suggested that consuming genetically modified foods could have negative health effects, although these claims are still debated in the scientific community.  Ultimately, whether genetically modifying foods is a good idea or not depends on how the technology is used and regulated. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of genetically modified foods, and to implement appropriate safety measures to ensure that the technology is used responsibly.

"  On one hand, smaller families can provide more resources, attention, and opportunities to their children. With fewer children, parents can allocate more time, energy, and financial resources towards each child's development and education. This can result in better academic and social outcomes for the children. Smaller families can also reduce the strain on the environment, as fewer people consume fewer resources.  On the other hand, larger families can provide built-in social support networks, as siblings can provide emotional and practical support throughout their lives. In addition, larger families can expose children to a greater diversity of perspectives and experiences. Children in larger families can learn important social skills, such as conflict resolution and teamwork, through their interactions with their siblings.  Ultimately, the decision to have a smaller or larger family depends on individual circumstances and values. While some families may choose to have smaller families to provide better opportunities for their children, others may prioritize the social and emotional benefits of a larger family. It is important to consider the unique needs and goals of each family before making a decision.            ",0
"  On the one hand, some people feel that credit card companies taking advantage of students on college campuses is unethical. Students are often low on cash and may not fully understand the terms and conditions of credit card agreements, which could lead them to accumulate debt they cannot afford to pay off. Furthermore, credit card companies may offer incentives that may be enticing to students, such as free T-shirts or other merchandise, which can be seen as a predatory tactic to lure them into signing up for credit cards.  On the other hand, some people argue that credit card companies offering credit to students can help them begin to build credit and learn financial responsibility. Students who are responsible with their credit cards can start building a credit history, which can help them in the future when they apply for loans or mortgages. Additionally, credit card companies may offer lower interest rates and other perks for students who maintain a good credit score, which can be helpful for them financially.  Overall, whether credit card companies offering credit to students is beneficial or exploitative is a complex issue that depends on individual circumstances. Students should educate themselves on the terms and conditions of credit cards and their own financial situation before deciding whether to apply for credit cards. It is essential to use credit responsibly and pay off balances in full each month to avoid accruing high-interest charges and accumulating debt.         ",0

The film follows the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia clan, and their struggles for power and survival in post-war America. The story is complex, with themes of family, loyalty, honor, violence, and the American Dream. The movie features an ensemble cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, who all give outstanding performances.

Its timeless themes and masterful execution make it a true classic that will continue to inspire and entertain audiences for generations to come.       ",0
"  Reality shows have gained popularity in recent years, and there are now more shows in this genre than ever before. However, whether or not these shows make good television depends on several factors.  On the one hand, reality shows can be entertaining and engaging for viewers, as they offer a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people and their personal struggles and triumphs. These shows can also be educational, as they can help viewers learn about different cultures and lifestyles.  For example, the show ""Queer Eye"" on Netflix offers a positive and uplifting experience by featuring experts who provide makeovers to people who need a boost in their lives. This show helps viewers learn about different lifestyles and the challenges that people face while also promoting self-improvement and acceptance.  On the other hand, some reality shows can be overly dramatized and manipulative, which can detract from their entertainment value. These shows may rely on creating conflict and drama between the participants to increase viewership, rather than focusing on genuine human experiences.  For example, shows like ""Jersey Shore"" and ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" have been criticized for promoting negative and superficial values, and for contributing to the decline of culture and intellectual standards on television.  In conclusion, reality shows can make good television if they are well-produced and offer genuine insights into the human experience. However, if they rely on overly dramatized situations and promote negative values, they may not be good for society as a whole.    ",0
"  On the one hand, the principle of ""an eye for an eye"" is often associated with retributive justice, which seeks to punish offenders in a way that is proportional to the harm they have caused. Supporters of this approach argue that it can serve as a deterrent to future crime and can provide a sense of closure to victims and their families. For example, in some cultures, the death penalty is seen as an appropriate punishment for murder because it reflects the seriousness of the crime.  On the other hand, critics of the ""an eye for an eye"" approach argue that it can lead to a cycle of violence and perpetuate a culture of revenge. Punishing someone in the same way they harmed another person may not actually restore justice or promote healing, but instead simply cause more harm. Additionally, determining an appropriate punishment based solely on the harm caused can be difficult and subjective, as factors such as intention, context, and mitigating circumstances may need to be taken into account. For example, a person who steals to feed their family may not deserve the same punishment as someone who steals out of greed.  Ultimately, the appropriateness of the ""an eye for an eye"" principle as a basis for determining punishment depends on one's personal beliefs about the purpose of justice and the role of punishment. Some may see it as a necessary form of retribution, while others may view it as a flawed approach that perpetuates harm rather than promoting healing and restoration.   ",0
"  The idea of banning passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems is a controversial one, and there are valid arguments both in favor of and against it.  On the one hand, such a ban could greatly reduce air and noise pollution, as well as traffic congestion. By forcing people to rely on walking, biking, or public transportation, the number of cars on the road would decrease significantly, leading to improved air quality and reduced traffic noise. In addition, public transportation systems could become more efficient and reliable with fewer cars on the road, leading to faster and more convenient travel for commuters.  On the other hand, such a ban could have negative consequences for some individuals, particularly those who rely on cars for their livelihoods, such as taxi drivers and delivery personnel. Additionally, some people may find it difficult or inconvenient to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes like walking and biking. For example, individuals with disabilities or who live far from public transportation stops may find it challenging to get around.  Overall, a ban on passenger cars in cities with extensive public transportation systems could have significant benefits for the environment and traffic flow. However, it is important to consider the potential negative consequences for individuals who rely on cars for their livelihoods or find it difficult to rely solely on public transportation or active transportation modes. A more feasible approach may be to promote the use of public transportation and active transportation modes while still allowing for the use of passenger cars.  ",0
"  Today's talk shows are designed to generate high ratings and attract viewers, and often do so by featuring provocative and controversial topics. This can result in heated debates between guests and audience members, which can sometimes turn physical and lead to injury.  While some may argue that this is a sign of talk shows going too far, it is important to remember that individuals have the freedom to choose whether or not they want to participate in such shows. In addition, talk show producers have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their guests and audience members.  That being said, it is important for talk show producers to balance the desire for high ratings with a commitment to safety and responsible journalism. They should take steps to ensure that guests and audience members feel comfortable and respected, and that debates do not become too heated or violent. Ultimately, it is up to the individual viewer to decide whether they find the content of these shows appropriate or not.  ",0
" One thing I have noticed is that change can be difficult, but it can also be transformative. It's common for people to get stuck in routines, habits, and ways of thinking that don't serve them well, but making a change, even a small one, can lead to improved well-being and better outcomes.  There are many changes people can make to improve their lives and the lives of those around them. One example is taking steps to improve physical health. Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help prevent chronic diseases and improve mental health. Quitting smoking or reducing alcohol consumption can also have significant health benefits.  Another change that can improve one's life is to cultivate positive relationships with friends, family, and colleagues. This can involve reaching out to people, having meaningful conversations, and showing genuine interest in their lives. Simple gestures like a smile, a kind word, or a thoughtful gesture can go a long way in creating positive interactions with others.  Another way to make a change for the better is by volunteering or engaging in charitable work. This can give a sense of purpose and fulfillment, while also making a positive impact on society. There are many causes to get involved in, such as helping the homeless, supporting education, or promoting environmental sustainability.  Finally, making a change in one's mindset can have a profound effect on life. Learning to practice gratitude, mindfulness, and positive self-talk can lead to increased happiness, resilience, and well-being. Practicing these techniques can help people manage stress and anxiety, and improve their overall mental health.  It's important to remember that change doesn't have to be dramatic or all-encompassing. Small changes can still make a big difference in one's life and the lives of others. It's also important to be patient and persistent when making changes. It's normal to encounter setbacks and obstacles, but with perseverance, change can become a habit and part of a daily routine.  In conclusion, making a change for the better can improve one's life and the lives of others. Whether it's improving physical health, cultivating positive relationships, volunteering, or adopting a more positive mindset, any step towards improvement is worth taking. Change may not be easy, but it can be transformative and lead to a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling life. ",0
" The statement by Bob Dylan about success reflects a subjective viewpoint that can be interpreted in various ways.  On one hand, Dylan's definition of success may be valid for individuals who prioritize personal fulfillment over material wealth or external recognition. For such people, the ability to pursue their passions and hobbies while maintaining a healthy work-life balance could indeed constitute a sense of achievement.  On the other hand, for some people, success may involve striving towards a particular goal, such as professional success or financial stability. In this case, the statement might not fully capture what success means to them. These individuals might define success as achieving their ambitions, attaining a particular level of wealth or status, or contributing to society in some way.  Ultimately, the concept of success is highly subjective and varies depending on a person's values, beliefs, and life experiences. It is up to each individual to determine what success means to them and how they wish to pursue it. Some people may find that Dylan's definition of success resonates with them, while others may not.          ",0
" As the world continues to grapple with the effects of climate change, it has become more important than ever to take action to protect the environment. One of the best ways to make a positive impact is by participating in eco-friendly activities such as carpooling, recycling, and planting trees. While all three of these activities have their benefits, in this essay, I will focus on the benefits of planting trees and why everyone should actively participate in this activity.  Trees are an essential component of our ecosystem. They play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe, reducing the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and providing habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species. Unfortunately, deforestation, climate change, and urbanization have led to a significant decline in the number of trees worldwide. This is where we come in as individuals to help.  Planting trees is one of the simplest and most effective ways to contribute to the environment. It is a cost-effective activity that can be done almost anywhere, whether in our backyards, public parks, or along the streets. One of the most significant advantages of planting trees is their ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Trees also help to prevent soil erosion, provide shade, and improve air quality.  Another significant advantage of planting trees is that they are a long-term investment. A single tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon dioxide per year and release enough oxygen for two people to breathe. Over their lifetime, trees continue to grow and contribute to the environment in many ways, making them an essential part of our ecosystem.  Planting trees is also an excellent way to bring people together. Community tree planting events are increasingly common, and they provide an opportunity for people to come together to work towards a common goal. Such activities can foster a sense of community and pride, not to mention the health benefits of spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activity.  In conclusion, planting trees is an essential activity that benefits both the environment and society as a whole. It is a low-cost and effective way to reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, prevent soil erosion, and bring communities together. Therefore, we should all actively participate in tree planting activities whenever possible to help build a healthier, greener world for ourselves and future generations.        ",0
" On one hand, some parents might argue that it is their responsibility to monitor their children's internet usage and protect them from potentially harmful content. They may feel that it is their duty to ensure that their children are not exposed to explicit images or dangerous material, which could negatively affect their mental and emotional well-being. Censoring websites with inappropriate content may be a way to limit the chances of children coming across such material.  On the other hand, other parents might argue that censorship is not the best solution. They may believe that children should be allowed to learn and explore on their own, without overly strict restrictions. Moreover, censorship can be difficult to enforce, as there are so many websites and online platforms with varying degrees of control over content. Even if parents manage to block certain sites or keywords, their children may still find ways to access inappropriate material through alternative channels.  Ultimately, it is up to individual parents to decide whether or not they should censor websites with inappropriate content. However, it is important for parents to strike a balance between protecting their children and allowing them to grow and learn independently. Communication with their children about responsible internet usage, as well as the potential risks of accessing inappropriate material, is also crucial in guiding them to make good decisions online. Additionally, there are various tools and resources available to parents, such as parental control software, that can help monitor and limit their children's online activities.       ",0

" based on my vast knowledge, there is a book that I would recommend to everyone: ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee.  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a classic novel published in 1960 that tells the story of a young girl, Scout Finch, growing up in the Southern United States during the 1930s. The novel explores themes of racism, injustice, and prejudice through the lens of Scout's experiences as she witnesses her father, a lawyer named Atticus Finch, defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been wrongly accused of a crime.  The novel is an American literary masterpiece that has been widely read and celebrated for over half a century. It has won numerous awards and accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize, and has been translated into more than 40 languages. Despite its age, the book remains incredibly relevant today, particularly in light of ongoing issues with racial inequality and social justice.  One of the reasons that ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is such an important book is because it forces readers to confront the difficult and uncomfortable truths about the history of race relations in the United States. Through its characters and storylines, the novel shows the ways in which racism and prejudice have been deeply ingrained in American society for generations, and how they continue to shape our world today.  At the same time, however, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is also a deeply moving and engaging story. The novel is written from Scout's perspective, and readers are able to follow her growth and development as she begins to understand the complexities of the world around her. The novel is filled with memorable characters, including Atticus Finch, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest heroes in American literature.  Reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" can be a transformative experience. It challenges readers to think critically about their own beliefs and biases, and to consider the ways in which they might be contributing to social injustice. It also offers hope and inspiration, showing how one person can make a difference in the world by standing up for what is right.  In conclusion, ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a book that should be required reading for everyone. Its timeless message about the importance of justice, equality, and compassion is as relevant today as it was when it was first published over 60 years ago. By reading this book, we can all gain a deeper understanding of our shared history and work towards building a better future for ourselves and our communities.         ",0

" In recent years, the United States has been perceived by some as a nation of ""couch potatoes."" This stereotype is not without basis, as many Americans lead sedentary lifestyles that involve a lot of sitting and minimal physical activity. However, this lack of activity has significant consequences for our health and well-being. In this essay, I will make a case for why it is important to be physically active and encourage readers to incorporate more movement into their daily lives.  To begin with, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. It can also improve overall health by helping to manage weight, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, and improving mental health. Being physically active can also increase energy levels, improve sleep quality, and reduce stress levels.  Beyond the health benefits, physical activity can also be an enjoyable and social experience. Exercise can be a great way to meet new people and make friends. Participating in team sports, joining a fitness class, or taking a dance lesson can all be great opportunities to connect with others who share similar interests. Additionally, exercise can be a great way to enjoy nature and explore new places. Going for a hike, a bike ride, or a swim in the ocean can all be fun and rewarding experiences.  However, despite these benefits, many Americans struggle to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. One reason for this is the perception that exercise has to be time-consuming and intense. In reality, even small amounts of activity can have significant health benefits. Walking for just 30 minutes a day can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve overall health. Additionally, there are many ways to incorporate movement into your daily routine, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator or doing some light stretching during a break at work.  Another obstacle to physical activity is the belief that it has to be expensive. While gym memberships and fitness classes can be costly, there are many ways to be active that don't require a lot of money. Going for a run or a walk outside is free, and there are many free resources available online that offer workouts and exercise routines that can be done at home with minimal equipment.  In conclusion, physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and well-being. Despite the stereotype of the ""couch potato,"" there are many ways to be physically active that are enjoyable, social, and accessible. By incorporating movement into our daily lives, we can improve our health, connect with others, and enjoy all the benefits that come with an active lifestyle. So let's get up, get moving, and start living our best lives!                ",0

" On the one hand, increasing the speed limit can save time and increase efficiency for motorists traveling long distances on highways. It can also lead to increased economic productivity by reducing transportation time for goods and services. Furthermore, many modern cars are designed to operate safely at higher speeds, so there may not be a significant increase in accidents or fatalities as a result of higher speed limits.  On the other hand, there are potential risks associated with increasing the speed limit. Driving at high speeds reduces the reaction time of drivers, making it more difficult to avoid collisions or react to unexpected events. Moreover, higher speeds increase the force of impact in a crash, which can lead to more severe injuries or fatalities. In addition, some roads may not be designed for higher speeds, leading to increased wear and tear on the road surface and infrastructure.  In conclusion, while there may be some advantages to increasing the speed limit on highways, it is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and benefits before making any changes. If higher speed limits are implemented, it is crucial to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to minimize the risk of accidents and injuries.                  ",0
" On the one hand, some people argue that a politician's private life should be of little concern to the public. They believe that what politicians do in their private lives is irrelevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. Furthermore, they argue that the media's excessive focus on the personal lives of politicians can distract from more important issues and potentially damage their reputation unfairly.  On the other hand, others argue that a politician's private life is relevant to their ability to govern and make decisions that affect the public. They believe that a politician's personal values and behavior can provide insight into their character and decision-making abilities. Additionally, they argue that a politician's behavior in their private life can be an indication of their honesty, integrity, and commitment to public service.  Moreover, some argue that a politician's personal behavior can have implications for their political decisions. For example, if a politician has a history of infidelity, they may be more susceptible to bribery or other forms of unethical behavior. Similarly, if a politician has a history of substance abuse or addiction, they may not be able to make sound decisions regarding drug policy.  In conclusion, the question of whether we should be concerned with the private affairs of politicians is complex, and opinions vary. Ultimately, the decision of how much weight to give to a politician's personal life is up to the individual voter. However, it is essential to consider the potential implications of a politician's behavior on their ability to govern and represent the interests of the public.                 ",0
" From a market perspective, the high salaries of professional athletes are determined by the laws of supply and demand. The top athletes possess rare and valuable skills, and they are in high demand among fans, teams, and media outlets. Consequently, teams are willing to pay top dollar to attract and retain the best players, and fans are willing to pay for tickets, merchandise, and media access to watch their favorite players compete. In other words, the high compensation is a reflection of the market value of the athletes.  Another argument in favor of high athlete compensation is the short career span of most professional athletes. Unlike many other professions, athletes have a limited window of opportunity to earn money and establish financial security. The average career span of an NFL player, for instance, is less than four years. Given the risks and demands of professional sports, many athletes retire with long-term injuries and health problems that require ongoing medical care. The high compensation, therefore, can be seen as a form of insurance against the financial risks and uncertainties of a short athletic career.  On the other hand, some people argue that the high salaries of athletes are unjustified, given the societal and economic problems that exist in the world. Critics argue that the money spent on professional sports could be better used to address issues such as poverty, healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. Some argue that the high salaries of athletes contribute to income inequality and perpetuate a culture of excessive consumption and materialism.  In conclusion, the issue of athlete compensation is complex and multifaceted. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the market-driven nature of the sports industry and the short career span of athletes are strong justifications for the high salaries of professional athletes. Ultimately, the question of whether athletes deserve such high compensation is a matter of personal opinion and values, and each individual should consider the arguments and evidence before making a judgment.

" Many parents choose not to allow their children to play with toy guns because they believe that it could encourage violent behavior and desensitize them to the consequences of gun violence. Some studies have suggested a link between exposure to violent media, including toy guns, and aggressive behavior in children.  However, other research has shown that children understand the difference between play and reality and can differentiate between real guns and toy guns. Additionally, children often engage in imaginary play that involves scenarios of good vs. evil, which can include using toy guns.  In my opinion, it's up to each individual parent to decide whether or not to allow their children to play with toy guns. If a parent is concerned about the potential effects on their child, they can choose to limit or not allow access to toy guns. It's also important for parents to talk to their children about the differences between play and real-life situations, as well as the dangers of real guns.  Ultimately, the decision should be based on the parent's personal values, beliefs, and the temperament of their child. Some children may not be interested in toy guns, while others may enjoy playing with them without displaying any negative effects.              ",0
" The search for extraterrestrial life has fascinated humans for centuries. While some people believe that we are alone in the universe, others are convinced that life exists beyond our planet. In my opinion, it is very likely that there is extraterrestrial life in the universe. In this essay, I will provide evidence and arguments to support my point of view.  Firstly, the vastness of the universe makes it highly probable that there are other forms of life out there. According to recent estimates, there are over 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe, each containing billions of stars. The idea that Earth is the only planet in this vast expanse of space that can support life seems unlikely. Given the sheer number of potential planets out there, it seems almost certain that some of them are capable of hosting life.  Secondly, scientists have discovered many planets that are similar in size and composition to Earth. These exoplanets are located within the habitable zones of their respective stars, meaning that they receive enough heat and light to potentially support life. One example is the exoplanet Kepler-452b, which is often referred to as Earth's ""cousin"". It is roughly the same size as Earth and orbits a star similar to our Sun. While we have not yet discovered any direct evidence of life on Kepler-452b, the fact that such a planet exists raises the possibility that other Earth-like planets could also be out there.  Finally, the discovery of microbial life on other planets or moons in our own solar system is not out of the question. There are several places in our own solar system that could potentially harbor life, such as Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. Europa is believed to have a subsurface ocean that could contain more than twice the amount of water found on Earth. If there is microbial life on Europa, it would be the first evidence of life beyond our planet.  In conclusion, the vastness of the universe, the discovery of exoplanets, and the potential for microbial life in our own solar system all point to the existence of extraterrestrial life. While we have yet to discover definitive proof of life beyond Earth, the evidence suggests that it is highly probable. As we continue to explore the universe, we may eventually find the answers we are looking for.                  ",0
" Advocates of this idea argue that it would allow parents to ensure their children's health, intelligence, and physical attractiveness. They believe that if we have the technology to select for specific traits, then why not use it to help children avoid genetic diseases or disabilities and enhance their cognitive abilities?  However, this kind of genetic engineering raises many ethical concerns. One of the most significant concerns is that it could lead to social inequality and discrimination based on the characteristics that parents choose for their children. For example, if wealthy parents can afford to design their children to be smarter, taller, and more attractive, it could widen the gap between the rich and the poor. This could also lead to discrimination against people who are not genetically engineered, creating a new form of societal hierarchy based on genetics.  Furthermore, it raises the question of who has the right to decide what traits are desirable and what traits are not. The idea of designing children can quickly spiral into eugenics, where some groups of people are considered inferior and unworthy of existence. This is a morally dangerous path that could lead to the dehumanization of certain groups.  Finally, there is the question of whether this kind of genetic engineering is necessary. While it may be desirable to eliminate genetic diseases or disabilities, there is no clear consensus on what makes a person intelligent, beautiful, or athletic. Many of these traits are subjective and can vary based on cultural norms and personal preferences. In essence, we could end up creating a homogenized society where everyone looks and thinks alike, eliminating diversity and creativity.  In conclusion, while the idea of designing children with specific physical and personality traits may seem attractive, it raises many ethical and societal concerns. It is essential to approach this issue with caution and carefully consider the long-term implications of this technology.                     ",0
" The discovery of a formula that would enable us to live forever is a fascinating idea that raises complex ethical, moral, and philosophical questions. While some may consider it a blessing, others might view it as a curse. In my opinion, the answer to whether it would be a blessing or a curse depends on various factors, including the availability of resources, the meaning of life, and the quality of life in general.  On one hand, living forever could be seen as a blessing. One significant advantage of immortality is that it allows us to pursue our passions and accomplish all of our goals without the pressure of time. People would have unlimited time to explore new cultures, learn new skills, and engage in creative endeavors. Moreover, they would have the opportunity to see the world evolve, from societal and technological advancements to the discovery of new planets.  However, living forever could also be seen as a curse. One possible issue is that overpopulation would become a significant problem, given that people would no longer die. Resources such as food, water, and housing would become increasingly scarce, and the quality of life for everyone would decrease. Furthermore, people might experience boredom, loneliness, and a sense of meaninglessness due to the monotony of living forever.  Additionally, living forever may challenge the meaning of life. Many people find meaning in life through their mortality, as it drives them to seek purpose and fulfillment. If people no longer have a limited lifespan, they may struggle to find a sense of purpose, leading to a lack of motivation and drive.  In conclusion, whether living forever would be a blessing or a curse is a complex issue. While it offers some advantages, such as the ability to achieve all of one's dreams and goals, it could also lead to overpopulation and a decline in quality of life. Furthermore, it may challenge the meaning of life itself, and raise new ethical and philosophical questions. Ultimately, the decision to pursue immortality would require careful consideration and a thoughtful evaluation of its potential consequences.                   ",0
" On one hand, computers can provide students with access to a vast amount of information and resources that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting. With the internet, students can explore topics in-depth and access a wide range of multimedia materials that can enhance their learning experience. For instance, a student can use a computer to watch educational videos, access virtual field trips, and collaborate with other students on group projects.  Moreover, computers can also help students develop important skills that are essential in the modern world, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and digital literacy. By using computers, students can learn how to analyze and evaluate information, communicate effectively using digital tools, and develop a deeper understanding of complex concepts.  On the other hand, some educators argue that computers can be a distraction in the classroom and may interfere with the learning process. For instance, students may be tempted to browse social media or play games during class, which can negatively affect their academic performance. Additionally, some students may become overly reliant on computers and fail to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills without the aid of technology.  In conclusion, while computers can be a valuable tool in the classroom, their effectiveness ultimately depends on how they are used. Educators must carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating computers into their teaching methods and develop strategies to ensure that they are used in a productive and effective way.

" Advocates of space exploration argue that the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in this field for several reasons. First, space exploration has the potential to drive technological advancements that can benefit many industries, including healthcare, telecommunications, and transportation. Second, space exploration could lead to new discoveries that could deepen our understanding of the universe and ultimately, our place in it. Third, space exploration could also bring economic benefits through the creation of new jobs and the development of new industries.  On the other hand, critics argue that the United States should not invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration, and instead focus on more pressing issues on Earth. They argue that the money spent on space exploration could be better spent on issues such as poverty, healthcare, and education. Additionally, they point out that space exploration is a risky and costly endeavor, and the potential benefits may not outweigh the costs.  Ultimately, whether or not the United States should invest more time, money, and effort in space exploration is a complex issue with no easy answer. It requires a careful consideration of the potential benefits and costs, as well as an understanding of the priorities and values of society.               ",0
" There are arguments both in favor and against raising school standards, but here are a few reasons why higher school standards may be beneficial:  Increased preparedness for college or the workforce: High school is meant to prepare students for the next stage of their lives, whether that be college or the workforce. Higher standards could ensure that students are more prepared for these challenges.  Improved critical thinking skills: Raising standards could encourage students to think more critically about what they are learning. This can be a valuable skill for students as they go on to college or the workforce.  Greater competitiveness: Higher standards could help American students compete with students from other countries. Many other countries already have higher academic standards in place, which can make it more difficult for American students to compete with them.  Better overall education: Higher standards could lead to a better overall education for students. This could help students develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world around them.  Of course, there are also arguments against raising school standards. Some people believe that higher standards could be too difficult for some students, which could lead to a higher dropout rate. Additionally, some people believe that higher standards could put too much pressure on students, which could negatively impact their mental health.  Ultimately, it's up to policymakers, educators, and society as a whole to decide whether or not to raise school standards. It's important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks before making any decisions.              ",0
" The statement ""ignorance is bliss"" suggests that not knowing certain information can make one happier. While it may be true that ignorance can sometimes protect us from unpleasant truths, it can also prevent us from making informed decisions, solving problems, and taking necessary actions. For example, not knowing the risks and consequences of a particular decision can lead to poor outcomes and regrets.  Similarly, the statement ""what you don't know won't hurt you"" implies that ignorance can prevent harm. However, not knowing important information can sometimes lead to negative consequences. For instance, not knowing about a health issue or a financial risk can lead to severe consequences.  Therefore, it's essential to seek knowledge and information to make informed decisions and prevent negative consequences, rather than relying on ignorance as a source of happiness or protection.

" Foreign aid is a controversial topic, with varying opinions on whether it is necessary or not. Some argue that we should focus solely on domestic issues, while others argue that foreign aid is essential for promoting global stability, reducing poverty, and improving human rights.  One thing to consider is that foreign aid can be beneficial to the United States as well. For example, it can help promote economic growth and trade, which can create new markets for U.S. goods and services. It can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases and reduce the risk of terrorism and other security threats.  However, it is also important to ensure that foreign aid is being used effectively and efficiently. Aid should be targeted towards programs and initiatives that have a proven track record of success, and there should be mechanisms in place to monitor and evaluate the impact of foreign aid programs.  Ultimately, the decision on how much foreign aid to spend should be based on a careful consideration of the costs and benefits. It is important to strike a balance between addressing domestic needs and supporting international development efforts. The exact amount will depend on a variety of factors, including the current economic climate, domestic priorities, and global circumstances.                ",0
" I can provide you with some information that may help you form your own opinion on this issue.  The debate on whether sport fishing is cruel and should be abolished is a controversial one. Animal rights activists argue that sport fishing causes unnecessary pain and suffering to fish, and that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. On the other hand, some argue that sport fishing is a legitimate and enjoyable activity, and that it can actually promote conservation efforts.  Those who oppose sport fishing argue that fish are sentient beings, capable of experiencing pain and suffering. They argue that sport fishing causes fish to experience significant stress and pain, and that it can result in serious injury or death for the fish. They also argue that fish do not receive the same level of protection as other animals, and that this is a form of speciesism.  Supporters of sport fishing, on the other hand, argue that it is a legitimate recreational activity that can actually promote conservation efforts. They argue that many anglers practice catch-and-release fishing, in which the fish is returned to the water after it has been caught. This allows fish populations to be maintained and even increased, as fish have the opportunity to reproduce and grow to maturity.  In addition, many anglers argue that sport fishing is an important part of our cultural heritage, and that it provides important economic benefits to local communities. Fishing tourism, for example, can bring in significant revenue to areas that are otherwise economically disadvantaged.  Ultimately, whether or not sport fishing should be abolished is a matter of personal opinion. While there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, it is important to consider the potential impact on fish populations, as well as the ethical implications of the practice. It is also important to consider the potential economic and cultural benefits of sport fishing, as well as the potential risks and benefits of alternative approaches to managing fish populations.

" It's important to consider the pros and cons of different security measures to create a safe learning environment for students.  On one hand, having security guards and equipment like video cameras and metal detectors can deter potential threats and provide a sense of safety for students and staff. These measures can also help identify and address issues like bullying or drug use on school grounds.  On the other hand, some argue that the presence of security measures can create an atmosphere of fear and mistrust, which can negatively impact the learning environment. Additionally, relying solely on security measures may not address the root causes of safety issues in schools, such as mental health and access to firearms.  Ultimately, the approach to security in public schools should balance safety concerns with the need for a positive and inclusive learning environment. This may involve a combination of security measures and other initiatives, such as mental health resources and conflict resolution programs, to address underlying issues that contribute to safety concerns in schools. Additionally, involving students, parents, and community members in discussions about school safety can help create a sense of ownership and collective responsibility for creating a safe and supportive learning environment.

" Advocates for a complete ban on smoking in restaurants and bars argue that it is necessary to protect the health of workers and customers. Secondhand smoke is a known carcinogen and can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious health problems. The separate smoking and non-smoking sections in restaurants are not effective in protecting people from secondhand smoke because the smoke can easily travel through the air conditioning system or other openings.  In addition to health concerns, some argue that a complete smoking ban would improve the overall atmosphere of restaurants and bars. Smoke can be unpleasant for non-smokers, and the smell can linger long after smokers have left. A smoke-free environment would be more pleasant for everyone and could attract more customers.  On the other hand, opponents of a complete smoking ban argue that it would infringe on the rights of smokers. They argue that smoking is a personal choice and that smokers should be allowed to smoke in designated areas. Some also argue that a complete smoking ban would hurt businesses that rely on smokers as customers.  In conclusion, the debate over whether to ban smoking in all restaurants and bars is complex and involves balancing health concerns with personal freedoms and economic considerations. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a careful evaluation of the evidence and the needs and preferences of the community.             ",0
" On the one hand, some people argue that eliminating grades and using regular evaluations instead can create a more supportive and personalized learning environment. In this approach, teachers can give students feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, provide guidance on how to improve, and encourage them to set individual goals. This can help students focus on the learning process rather than just the outcome, and promote a growth mindset that values effort and progress over perfection.  Furthermore, the grading system is often criticized for being too subjective and arbitrary. Grades may be influenced by factors beyond the student's control, such as the teacher's biases or expectations, the difficulty of the assignment, or the performance of other students. Moreover, grades can create a culture of competition and comparison among students, where success is measured by how well one does relative to others rather than by absolute standards of excellence.  On the other hand, there are also some potential drawbacks to the elimination of grades. For example, grades can provide a clear and objective measure of a student's performance, which can be helpful for college admissions, job applications, and other contexts where standardized assessments are required. Additionally, grades can motivate some students to work harder and aim for higher achievements, which can be beneficial for their future success.  Moreover, evaluations require more time and effort from teachers, who need to provide detailed feedback on each student's work and communicate it effectively. Evaluations can also be more difficult for students and parents to understand and interpret, as they may lack a clear reference point for comparison.  In conclusion, the debate between grading and evaluations is complex and multifaceted, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the best approach may depend on the specific goals, values, and context of each school and classroom. However, regardless of the grading system used, it is important to prioritize learning and growth over grades and competition, and to provide students with the support and guidance they need to reach their full potential.

" I don't have personal preferences or beliefs, but I can provide some arguments based on research and expert opinions about whether reading fiction is a waste of time or not.  Reading fiction can offer a plethora of benefits, making it a valuable use of time for many people. Here are some reasons why:  It helps improve empathy: Fictional stories can help readers develop empathy by allowing them to imagine different perspectives and emotions. By reading about the experiences of characters, people can learn to understand and appreciate the experiences of others in the real world. In fact, several studies have shown that reading fiction can increase empathy and emotional intelligence.  It boosts creativity: Reading fiction can ignite the imagination and inspire creative thinking. It allows readers to immerse themselves in a different world and think about new ideas and perspectives. This can help people develop their own creative skills and generate new ideas.  It reduces stress: Fiction can serve as an escape from the stressors of everyday life. Reading can provide relaxation and help people unwind, which can be beneficial for their mental health. Studies have also shown that reading for pleasure can help reduce stress and improve well-being.  It improves cognitive function: Reading requires the brain to engage in multiple cognitive processes, such as comprehension, analysis, and interpretation. As such, reading fiction can improve brain function and cognitive skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.  It can enhance language skills: Fictional stories can be an excellent way to learn new vocabulary and improve reading comprehension. Additionally, reading can help develop communication and writing skills by exposing people to different writing styles and techniques.  In conclusion, reading fiction can offer a multitude of benefits, making it a worthwhile and valuable use of time for many people. Whether it's for pleasure, education, or personal growth, fiction can help improve empathy, boost creativity, reduce stress, improve cognitive function, and enhance language skills. Therefore, it is not a waste of time, but rather a productive and enjoyable activity.          ",0
" There are arguments both for and against offering classes in a student's native language, and the decision ultimately depends on the goals of the educational system and the needs of the students.  On one hand, offering classes in a student's native language can provide important support for those who may struggle with English as a second language. These classes can help students better understand course material and allow them to participate more fully in classroom discussions, ultimately leading to greater success in their education. Additionally, maintaining proficiency in a native language can have cultural and personal benefits for students, allowing them to stay connected to their heritage and family members who may not speak English.  On the other hand, immersion in English can be a more effective way for students to learn the language and become more proficient. In some cases, offering classes in a student's native language can lead to a lack of motivation to learn English, which can ultimately hinder their ability to succeed in the broader society. Furthermore, if students do not learn English fluently, they may face difficulties later in life when trying to obtain employment or engage with the broader community.  In conclusion, the decision of whether to offer classes in a student's native language ultimately depends on the specific needs and goals of the student and the educational system. While offering support in a student's native language can provide important benefits, it is also important to prioritize language acquisition and ensure that students have the resources they need to become fluent in English.

" The United States is a diverse country with a robust economy, a democratic government, and a rich cultural heritage. It has been a leader in scientific and technological innovation, and many of the world's top universities are located in the United States. These factors, among others, have contributed to the perception that the United States is one of the best countries in the world.  However, it is important to note that every country has its strengths and weaknesses, and no country is perfect. The United States, like any other country, has its own set of challenges, including issues with inequality, social justice, and political polarization.  Furthermore, perceptions of the United States can vary greatly depending on individual experiences and perspectives. While some people may view the United States as a land of opportunity, others may see it as a place of struggle and hardship.

" As an AI language model, I don't have a personal opinion, but I can provide information to help you form your own perspective.  In my opinion, school cafeterias should offer low-fat and vegetarian lunch options to accommodate the diverse eating habits of all students. The availability of such options is crucial as students with different dietary restrictions and preferences should be able to enjoy healthy and nutritious meals during their school day.  Firstly, providing low-fat and vegetarian options in school cafeterias can help promote healthy eating habits among students. Students who consume a healthy diet tend to perform better academically and are less likely to develop health problems in the long run. This is especially important given the rising rates of obesity and other diet-related health issues among young people.  Secondly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options is an inclusive approach that caters to the diverse needs and preferences of students. Students who follow a vegetarian diet, for instance, may feel left out or even discriminated against if there are no suitable options available for them. By offering such options, schools can create a more welcoming and inclusive environment that values diversity.  Lastly, offering low-fat and vegetarian options can also be cost-effective in the long run. A healthy diet can lead to fewer absences due to illness, which can in turn reduce healthcare costs. Additionally, by catering to the dietary needs of all students, schools can ensure that students are more likely to purchase lunch from the cafeteria, which can increase revenue for the school.  In conclusion, I believe that schools should provide low-fat and vegetarian options in their cafeterias to accommodate the diverse dietary needs and preferences of students. Doing so can promote healthy eating habits, create a more inclusive environment, and be cost-effective in the long run.           ",0
" On one hand, bullying is a pervasive problem that can have serious consequences for both the victim and the perpetrator. It can lead to physical and emotional harm, as well as lasting psychological trauma. Additionally, bullying can negatively impact academic performance and overall well-being, creating an unsafe and hostile learning environment for students. In this sense, it is reasonable to argue that schools have a responsibility to address bullying, as they have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  On the other hand, some may argue that bullying is primarily a parental responsibility, and that schools should not be tasked with addressing this issue. Parents are often in the best position to recognize the warning signs of bullying behavior and to intervene early on. Furthermore, schools may not have the resources or expertise to adequately address complex social and emotional issues such as bullying. In this sense, it may be argued that schools should focus on providing academic instruction, leaving social and emotional development to parents.  Ultimately, whether schools should address bullying or leave it to parents depends on various factors, such as the severity of the bullying, the resources available to the school, and the role of parents in preventing and addressing bullying behavior. However, it is generally recognized that bullying is a serious issue that requires a collaborative effort between schools, parents, and communities to effectively prevent and address.

" However, I can present arguments for and against school uniforms for public school students based on research and common viewpoints.  Arguments in favor of school uniforms for public school students:  Uniforms can create a sense of community and promote a sense of equality among students, regardless of socioeconomic status. Students from all backgrounds can come together in the classroom without the distraction of wearing different clothes or brands. Uniforms can reduce the pressure and cost of buying trendy clothing or designer brands. This can ease the financial burden for families who cannot afford the latest fashion trends. School uniforms can promote a more serious and focused learning environment. Students are less likely to be distracted by clothing or appearances, and more likely to concentrate on their studies and learning outcomes. School uniforms can improve school safety by making it easier to identify who belongs on school grounds and who does not. This can be especially helpful in schools located in high-crime areas. School uniforms can also promote a sense of pride and identity within the school community. Students can feel proud to represent their school and can be more motivated to uphold the school's values and expectations. Arguments against school uniforms for public school students:  Requiring uniforms can stifle individuality and self-expression. Students may not have the opportunity to express their personalities or creativity through their clothing choices. Requiring school uniforms can be expensive for families who must purchase them. Some families may not be able to afford the cost of uniforms, which could lead to feelings of exclusion and inequality. There is no conclusive evidence that school uniforms improve academic performance or reduce disciplinary issues. While some studies have suggested a correlation, the evidence is not clear-cut and may depend on other factors such as school culture and community. Enforcing uniform policies can take away from valuable instructional time. Teachers may have to spend time checking student uniforms instead of teaching. School uniforms may not be suitable for all students, particularly those who may have specific cultural or religious dress requirements. In conclusion, both arguments have valid points, and it is ultimately up to each school district to decide whether to implement a school uniform policy. It is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of school uniforms, as well as the specific needs and cultural diversity of the student body.            ",0
" The movie and TV ratings systems were created to provide information to audiences about the content of films and TV shows, in order to help them make informed decisions about what they want to watch. The goal of these systems is to ensure that viewers are not exposed to material that they might find inappropriate or offensive.  The effectiveness and usefulness of these ratings systems depend on various factors, such as the accuracy of the ratings, the consistency of their application, and the level of awareness and understanding of the audience.  For example, in the United States, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) assigns ratings to movies based on their content, such as G (General Audiences), PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), R (Restricted), and NC-17 (No One 17 and Under Admitted). Similarly, TV Parental Guidelines assign ratings to TV shows based on their content, such as TV-Y (All Children), TV-Y7 (Older Children), TV-G (General Audience), TV-PG (Parental Guidance Suggested), TV-14 (Parents Strongly Cautioned), and TV-MA (Mature Audience Only).  While these ratings systems provide a general idea of the content of movies and TV shows, they are not always accurate or consistent. Some films or TV shows might receive a lower rating than they deserve, while others might be given a higher rating than necessary. Additionally, the rating system might not capture certain types of content that could be potentially harmful or offensive.  Moreover, the effectiveness of these ratings systems also depends on the level of awareness and understanding of the audience. While some viewers may rely on ratings to decide what to watch, others may not pay much attention to them, or may not fully understand what the different ratings mean.  In conclusion, while movie and TV ratings systems can be useful in providing information about the content of films and TV shows, their effectiveness depends on various factors. Ultimately, it is up to the individual viewer to decide what they want to watch and to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of different types of content.           ",0
" Honesty is often considered the best policy because it fosters trust, builds stronger relationships, and helps maintain personal integrity. However, there may be certain situations where lying can be justified.  For example, in some cases, a lie may be necessary to protect someone's safety. Suppose a friend asks you about their ex-partner's whereabouts, and you know that the ex-partner is stalking them. In that case, telling a lie to protect your friend's safety may be the right thing to do.  Similarly, in certain professions, lying can be necessary to maintain confidentiality and protect sensitive information. For instance, a therapist may need to lie to protect their client's privacy, or a journalist may need to lie to protect their source.  Moreover, lying can sometimes be a way to spare someone's feelings or prevent unnecessary harm. For instance, if someone is terminally ill and asks if they are going to recover, it may be more compassionate to lie and offer comfort and hope.  However, it's essential to note that lying can have significant negative consequences, and it's crucial to weigh the potential risks and benefits carefully. Even well-intentioned lies can erode trust and damage relationships over time, which can have lasting effects.  In conclusion, while honesty is generally the best policy, there may be certain situations where lying can be justified. It's essential to consider the context, potential consequences, and ethical implications before deciding whether to lie or tell the truth.              ",0
" From a logical standpoint, canceling extracurricular activities to solve a litter problem may not be the most effective solution. While it is essential to encourage students to take better care of their surroundings, canceling extracurricular activities may not address the root cause of the problem. Instead, the school administration should consider implementing specific measures to promote responsible behavior among students, such as increasing the number of trash cans, holding regular clean-up drives, or educating students about the environmental impact of littering.  Furthermore, extracurricular activities play a crucial role in a student's holistic development, providing opportunities for socialization, skill-building, and creative expression. Canceling these activities may lead to negative consequences such as decreased student engagement, lower academic performance, and reduced motivation.  Instead of canceling extracurricular activities, the school administration can explore other alternatives, such as providing incentives for responsible behavior, engaging students in the problem-solving process, or partnering with local organizations to address the issue. By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, the school administration can foster a culture of responsibility and create a long-lasting solution to the litter problem.  In summary, canceling extracurricular activities may not be the most effective solution to the litter problem on campus. The school administration should consider implementing specific measures to promote responsible behavior among students and explore alternative approaches to address the issue without compromising the educational and developmental needs of the students.

" Dear School Officials,  It is my pleasure to offer my opinion on how a recent large donation from an alumnus could be allocated in the most beneficial way for our school. I believe that this sum of money should be invested in improving the school's infrastructure and facilities to enhance the quality of education provided to our students.  To begin with, I strongly suggest that a portion of the donation be used to modernize our classrooms and laboratories. Upgrading the technology and equipment in these facilities will enable teachers to create more dynamic and interactive learning experiences for our students. This will also improve the school's overall academic performance and attract more students and teachers to our institution.  Secondly, I propose that the funds be used to establish a scholarship program for underprivileged students. This will provide opportunities for deserving students who might not have the financial means to attend the school. By offering scholarships, we can ensure that we provide equal opportunities to students of all socio-economic backgrounds, making our school a more diverse and inclusive place.  In addition, I suggest that a portion of the funds be used to enhance the school's extracurricular activities. Activities such as sports, music, and arts programs are just as important as academics in the development of well-rounded students. By investing in these programs, we can offer students more opportunities to discover their talents and develop their skills.  Finally, I recommend using a portion of the donation to create a research fund for faculty members. This will enable teachers to carry out cutting-edge research in their respective fields, which can contribute to the development of new knowledge and ideas. By doing so, the school can enhance its reputation as a center of academic excellence.  In conclusion, investing the alumnus's donation in improving our school's infrastructure and facilities, establishing a scholarship program, enhancing extracurricular activities, and creating a research fund will create a ripple effect that will benefit the school and its community for years to come. I hope that my proposal will be considered seriously and will help guide the allocation of the funds for the greater good of the school.  Thank you for your time and attention.       ",0
" It is true that American society is known for its competitive nature. This competitiveness can be seen in various aspects of life, including education, sports, business, and even personal relationships. Many people argue that this level of competition is too high and can have negative consequences.  On the one hand, competition can be a good thing. It can motivate people to work harder, push themselves to achieve more, and strive for excellence. In a competitive environment, individuals are more likely to innovate and find new ways to succeed, which can lead to progress and growth. Additionally, competition can help individuals learn valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication, which are important in both personal and professional settings.  However, on the other hand, excessive competition can also have negative effects. For one, it can create a culture of stress and anxiety, as individuals feel pressure to constantly perform at high levels. This can lead to burnout and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Additionally, competition can create a winner-takes-all mentality, where only a few individuals are able to succeed while the rest are left behind. This can result in inequality and a lack of social mobility, particularly in areas such as education and the job market.  In conclusion, American society is indeed known for its competitiveness, and while competition can have its benefits, it can also have negative consequences. It is up to individuals and society as a whole to strike a balance between healthy competition and excessive pressure, and to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

They are an indispensable part of modern life, and their impact is felt in almost every aspect of society.  Smartphones have changed the way people interact with one another, allowing people to communicate instantaneously across vast distances through messaging apps, social media, and video calls. They have also transformed the way we access information, making it possible to quickly and easily look up any question or query on the internet.  Furthermore, smartphones have also revolutionized the way people consume media, allowing them to stream movies, TV shows, and music on-demand. They have also created new forms of entertainment, such as mobile gaming and social media challenges.  Overall, the smartphone represents the pinnacle of technological advancement in the 21st century. It embodies the culture of the era, where people are increasingly connected to one another and the world around them, and where information is readily accessible at all times. It would be fitting to place a smartphone in a time capsule for future generations to understand the cultural significance and technological advancements of the early 21st century.       ",0
" Historically, there have been successful leaders who were both loved and feared. However, it is essential to consider the context and situation in which the leader operates. In some cases, being feared may be more effective, while in others, being loved may be the better approach.  Leaders who are feared often use intimidation, punishment, and the threat of consequences to maintain control over their subordinates. While this approach can be effective in the short term, it can also create a hostile work environment that can ultimately harm the organization's long-term success. Moreover, this type of leadership style can lead to a lack of trust and respect among the team members, which can negatively impact team morale, creativity, and productivity.  On the other hand, leaders who are loved often build a culture of trust, respect, and teamwork. They create a positive work environment by showing empathy, compassion, and concern for their team members. This approach often results in a more motivated and productive workforce, which can lead to higher levels of success for the organization in the long run.  In conclusion, the question of whether a leader should be loved or feared is not straightforward. Ultimately, the most effective leadership style will depend on the situation, the organization, and the people being led. A leader who can balance both approaches and adapt their leadership style to the situation will likely be the most successful.          ",0
" On one hand, requiring teachers to pass competency tests before they can teach can ensure that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to provide quality education to students. It can also help to raise the standards of teaching and improve the overall quality of education. This can have positive effects on student outcomes, including higher academic achievement and better preparation for future careers.  On the other hand, some may argue that requiring teachers to pass competency tests could be too restrictive, limiting the number of qualified teachers available to teach. Additionally, such tests may not be a reliable indicator of teaching ability or effectiveness. Some teachers who excel in the classroom may not perform well on tests, while others who perform well on tests may not necessarily be effective teachers. Moreover, such tests could disproportionately affect teachers from underprivileged backgrounds, who may not have had the same educational opportunities as others.  Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between ensuring that teachers have the necessary qualifications and skills to teach while also considering the potential drawbacks of requiring competency tests. Alternative methods for ensuring teacher quality could include ongoing professional development opportunities, teacher mentorship programs, and performance evaluations by school administrators and peers.

They have the ability to analyze and interpret data, problem-solve, and conduct experiments to further our understanding of the universe.  For example, a scientist could study the effects of long-term space travel on the human body, investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial life, or conduct experiments on materials and technologies that could be used in space exploration.  Additionally, scientists are trained to work methodically and meticulously, which is essential in the often high-risk and complex environment of space exploration. They can also work collaboratively with other astronauts and professionals from different fields to achieve a common goal.  Overall, I believe that sending a scientist to the next space station would be a wise choice, as they could contribute greatly to our understanding of the universe and help us advance our capabilities in space exploration.

" However, I can present some information and arguments that can help you formulate your own opinion on whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school.  Learning a foreign language has many benefits, both practical and cultural. In practical terms, knowing a second language can increase job opportunities and salary potential, especially in fields such as business, diplomacy, and tourism. Additionally, learning a foreign language can enhance cognitive abilities such as memory, problem-solving, and multitasking. On a cultural level, knowing a foreign language can help promote understanding and appreciation of other cultures, leading to increased tolerance and diversity.  On the other hand, requiring all students to learn a foreign language may have some drawbacks. Some students may not have the aptitude or interest in learning a foreign language, and forcing them to do so could cause unnecessary stress and frustration. Additionally, the resources required to provide quality foreign language instruction to all students may not be available in some schools, leading to unequal access to education.  In summary, the decision of whether all students should be required to learn a foreign language before graduating from high school is complex and multifaceted. While there are clear benefits to learning a foreign language, it may not be appropriate or feasible for all students. Ultimately, the decision should be made based on the individual needs and goals of each student, as well as the resources and priorities of each school and community.        ",0
" Advocates of online degree programs argue that they offer convenience and flexibility, allowing students who may have work or family responsibilities to earn a degree. Online programs can also save time and money on commuting, housing, and other expenses associated with on-campus education. Additionally, online courses often use the latest educational technology and offer a range of multimedia resources, providing students with an engaging learning experience.  On the other hand, some educators worry that online degree programs may not provide the same quality of education as on-campus programs. They argue that online courses lack face-to-face interaction with professors and peers, which can limit opportunities for discussions and collaborative learning. Additionally, they are concerned that online programs may not have the same level of academic rigor and standards as traditional on-campus programs, and that students may cheat more easily.  Ultimately, the decision to offer degree programs entirely online should be made based on a variety of factors, including the type of program, the resources available, and the target audience. Institutions that choose to offer online programs should ensure that they meet the same academic standards as on-campus programs and provide adequate support and resources to their students. They should also consider ways to promote student engagement and ensure academic integrity, such as using proctored exams and discussion forums.       ",0
"  In my opinion, a good education should be considered a fundamental right for everyone, not a privilege for a select few. There are several reasons why I hold this belief.  Firstly, education is essential for personal and societal development. It equips individuals with the knowledge and skills they need to be productive members of society and to contribute to the progress of their community. A good education not only helps people secure better-paying jobs and build successful careers but also enables them to make informed decisions and participate fully in the democratic process.  Secondly, education is a key factor in reducing poverty and inequality. Access to quality education can help break the cycle of poverty and open up opportunities for marginalized groups. By providing equal access to education for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, we can create a more just and equitable society.  Lastly, education is a right recognized by the United Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, states that everyone has the right to education. This includes the right to free, compulsory primary education, and access to secondary and tertiary education. As such, it is the responsibility of governments and societies to ensure that this right is upheld.  In conclusion, a good education is a right, not a privilege. Access to quality education is essential for personal and societal development, reducing poverty and inequality, and upholding fundamental human rights. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every individual has access to a good education, regardless of their background or circumstances.      ",0

As a loyal viewer, I am urging you to reconsider your decision to cancel the show and continue airing it for its dedicated fan base.  The show has brought so much joy and entertainment to me and many others who tune in every week to see the latest episodes. It has become a staple in our lives, providing us with a sense of comfort and familiarity. The characters have become like friends to us, and we look forward to following their stories each week.  Furthermore, the show has been consistently praised by both critics and audiences alike for its quality writing, compelling storylines, and talented cast. It has been a rare gem in a sea of reality TV shows and mindless sitcoms. Cancelling the show would not only disappoint the fans, but it would also be a disservice to the talented individuals who have worked hard to create this masterpiece.  I understand that ratings and financial considerations may have played a role in the decision to cancel the show. However, I implore you to reconsider and look at the bigger picture. The show has a dedicated fan base, and cancelling it would not only upset them but could also lead to a loss of viewership and revenue for your network.  In conclusion, I respectfully request that you reconsider your decision to cancel the show and continue airing it for its dedicated fan base. Thank you for your time and consideration.    ",0
" Dear Town Officials,  As a resident of this town for many years, I have seen the community evolve and grow. While there have been many positive changes, there is one area that I believe could use improvement. The issue I would like to address is the lack of access to public parks and green spaces in our neighborhood.  Studies have shown that access to public parks and green spaces can have a positive impact on the physical and mental health of residents. Green spaces can serve as a place for exercise, relaxation, and socialization. They also provide a space for children to play and explore nature.  Unfortunately, in our neighborhood, there are few public parks or green spaces. This is a problem that can be easily remedied with the creation of a new park or the improvement of an existing one.  A new park would not only benefit residents, but it would also attract visitors to our town. Parks and green spaces are often a selling point for families looking to move to a new area. By investing in a new park or improving an existing one, we could increase property values and stimulate economic growth in the community.  Additionally, a new park could provide opportunities for community engagement and volunteering. Residents could come together to maintain the park, organize events, and create a sense of community.  There are many options for creating a new park or improving an existing one. The town could convert an unused lot into a park or add amenities such as walking trails, playgrounds, and picnic areas to an existing park.  Investing in a new park or improving an existing one would be a wise decision for the town. The benefits to residents, visitors, and the local economy are clear. I urge the town officials to seriously consider this proposal and take action to improve our neighborhood.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.   ",0
" However, it is essential to provide balanced and comprehensive news coverage that covers a wide range of topics, including both local and international news.  While sensational items such as local crimes and celebrity gossip may be appealing to viewers, news programs have a responsibility to inform their audience about significant national and international events. Global issues such as climate change, political unrest, and economic developments have a direct impact on people's lives, and therefore, they deserve proper coverage.  Moreover, the media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and promoting informed decision-making. By providing accurate and impartial coverage of national and international news, news programs can help their audience understand complex issues and make informed decisions about important topics.  Therefore, news programs should strive to strike a balance between sensational items and important national and international news. They should prioritize providing in-depth coverage of global issues that have a significant impact on people's lives, while also including local news that is relevant to their audience.   ",0
" However, I can provide some objective information and arguments that may help you form your own opinion.  Proponents of extending the school year argue that it would provide several benefits. Firstly, it would prevent the ""summer slide,"" where students can lose some of the knowledge and skills they learned during the school year due to the long break. Secondly, it would provide more time for teachers to cover material and for students to absorb it, leading to better academic outcomes. Thirdly, it would make it easier for families to plan vacations and childcare arrangements, as there would be more breaks throughout the year instead of one long vacation.  On the other hand, opponents of extending the school year argue that summer break provides important opportunities for students to engage in non-academic activities, such as sports, arts, and travel, that can be difficult to pursue during the school year. They also argue that summer break provides a necessary respite for students and teachers alike, and that extending the school year could lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Additionally, extending the school year would require significant changes to school schedules, which could be difficult to implement and costly for school districts.  In conclusion, the decision to extend the school year or not is a complex one that involves balancing academic needs, family needs, and the well-being of students and teachers. Ultimately, the best approach may vary depending on the specific needs and circumstances of each community.  ",0
" Proponents of surveillance cameras argue that they increase safety and deter crime. With cameras in parking lots and other public areas, law enforcement officials can monitor activity and respond quickly to any incidents. Additionally, the presence of cameras can discourage criminals from committing crimes in the first place, knowing that they may be caught on camera.  However, opponents of surveillance cameras argue that they violate our right to privacy and can be abused by law enforcement officials. Cameras can capture private conversations and other personal information, and it is possible for this information to be used for purposes other than ensuring safety. Furthermore, the use of cameras can lead to a chilling effect on our freedom of expression, as people may feel uncomfortable expressing themselves in public knowing that they are being watched.  In conclusion, the installation of surveillance cameras in public places is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. Ultimately, the decision to install cameras should be made after careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks, as well as the laws and regulations governing their use. It is important to strike a balance between ensuring public safety and protecting individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression. ",0
" In general, the saying ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" suggests that having a small amount of information on a subject can lead to mistakes, misunderstandings, and even dangerous consequences. While it's essential to have some knowledge on a topic, it can be harmful if we rely solely on a limited amount of information without understanding the broader context.  For example, let's consider a scenario where an individual with little knowledge about electrical wiring tries to install a new outlet without proper training. They may have read a few online tutorials or watched a video, but their limited knowledge may not be enough to ensure safe installation. As a result, they could potentially put themselves and others at risk of electrical shock or even a fire.  Similarly, in the field of medicine, a person with a little knowledge may self-diagnose and self-medicate without fully understanding the potential risks and side effects of their actions. This could lead to worsening their health condition, incorrect treatments, or even addiction.  Another example is when people rely on rumors, fake news, and misinformation as a basis for their opinions and beliefs. This limited knowledge can lead to biased, irrational, and sometimes harmful actions towards individuals or groups.  In conclusion, a little knowledge can indeed be a dangerous thing if we don't acknowledge its limitations and seek to expand our understanding beyond the superficial level. It's essential to be open-minded, seek out reliable sources, and continually educate ourselves to avoid the potential dangers of having only limited knowledge.     ",0
" The question of whether schools should play classical music during exams or allow students to listen to it on headphones is a complex one, and there are arguments on both sides. On the one hand, research has shown that classical music can have a positive effect on concentration, memory, and overall academic performance. It has been suggested that the music's calming effect can help reduce stress and anxiety, which may improve performance on exams.  However, it's essential to note that music can also be a source of distraction, especially if the student doesn't enjoy classical music or if the volume is too high. Some students may find it difficult to focus with any background noise, while others may find the music itself distracting and may struggle to concentrate on the exam.  In light of these considerations, schools should consider a middle ground approach that takes into account the needs and preferences of individual students. For example, they could provide a quiet exam environment for those who prefer it, while also allowing students who find classical music helpful to listen to it on headphones. Additionally, schools could consider offering students the option to choose whether they want to listen to classical music during exams, rather than making it a mandatory practice.  In conclusion, the effects of classical music on exam performance are still not fully understood, and the impact may vary from person to person. Therefore, schools should consider a flexible approach that accommodates students' diverse preferences and needs to ensure the best possible learning outcomes.    ",0
" Arguments for mandatory seatbelt use:  Safety: Seatbelts save lives and reduce the severity of injuries in car accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seatbelt use reduces the risk of death and serious injury by about 50% in a car accident. In addition, seatbelts prevent occupants from being ejected from the vehicle, which is one of the most dangerous outcomes of a crash.  Cost savings: Seatbelt use can lead to cost savings in healthcare and insurance costs. Unrestrained occupants are more likely to suffer severe injuries, which require extensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. This results in higher healthcare costs and insurance premiums for everyone.  Public health: Promoting seatbelt use through mandatory laws can improve public health by reducing the number of fatalities and injuries from car accidents. This benefits not only the individuals involved in the accidents but also their families and communities.  Arguments against mandatory seatbelt use:  Personal freedom: Some people argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates their personal freedom and individual rights. They believe that adults should be free to make their own choices about whether or not to wear a seatbelt.  Effectiveness: Some opponents of mandatory seatbelt use argue that seatbelts are not effective in all types of accidents. For example, in rollover accidents, the roof can collapse and crush the occupants, regardless of whether or not they are wearing a seatbelt.  Enforcement: Mandatory seatbelt laws require enforcement, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Police officers have to monitor and issue citations to drivers who are not wearing seatbelts, which takes time away from other law enforcement activities.  In conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of mandatory seatbelt laws. Seatbelts save lives, reduce healthcare costs, and improve public health. While some may argue that mandatory seatbelt use violates personal freedom, the benefits of seatbelt use outweigh the potential drawbacks.       ",0
" Arguments for the reading of classical literature:  Cultural literacy: Classical literature provides a foundation for understanding Western culture and history. Many contemporary works draw on themes and motifs found in classical literature, and without knowledge of these works, readers may miss important allusions and references.  Intellectual development: Reading classical literature can help students develop critical thinking and analytical skills. The complex plots, characterizations, and themes found in classical literature can challenge students and push them to think deeply about the world around them.  Literary value: Classical literature has stood the test of time and is still read and studied today because of its literary value. Shakespeare, for example, is widely considered to be one of the greatest writers in the English language, and his works continue to be performed and adapted in various forms.  Arguments against the reading of classical literature:  Lack of relevance: Some students argue that classical literature is no longer relevant to modern life and that contemporary works would be more meaningful and relatable. They may find it difficult to connect with characters and situations that are vastly different from their own experiences.  Inaccessible language: The language used in classical literature can be archaic and difficult to understand, especially for students who are not native speakers of English. This can be a barrier to engagement and comprehension.  Limited diversity: Classical literature tends to be written by white, male authors and may not reflect the perspectives or experiences of a diverse range of people. This can be problematic for students who are looking to explore different perspectives and experiences in literature.  In conclusion, while there are arguments for and against the reading of classical literature in English classes, ultimately it is up to individual educators and schools to decide what works best for their students. A balanced approach that includes both classical and contemporary literature can provide students with a well-rounded education and appreciation for the rich literary traditions of the English language.

" Some argue that a parent should be a child's disciplinarian, while others believe a parent should be a child's best friend. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and ultimately the decision depends on individual circumstances and personal beliefs.  On one hand, being a child's disciplinarian can help establish boundaries, discipline, and respect for authority. Parents who take on this role may use a strict, authoritarian style of parenting, where rules are enforced and punishments are given for disobedience. This approach can help children learn self-control, responsibility, and respect for others.  For example, a parent may discipline their child for lying or breaking the rules. The child may feel upset or angry at the time, but over time they may learn that their actions have consequences and that they need to be responsible for their behavior. This can help them become more self-disciplined and mature.  On the other hand, being a child's best friend can help build a close, trusting relationship with their parent. Parents who take on this role may use a more relaxed, permissive style of parenting, where rules are flexible and negotiation is encouraged. This approach can help children feel heard, valued, and understood.  For example, a parent may listen to their child's problems, offer advice, and support them through difficult times. The child may feel more comfortable talking to their parent about their feelings and experiences, which can strengthen their bond and lead to greater trust and openness.  Ultimately, the decision of whether to be a child's disciplinarian or best friend depends on a number of factors, including the child's age, personality, and behavior, as well as the parent's own beliefs, values, and parenting style. A balanced approach that combines elements of both discipline and friendship may be the most effective for helping children grow and develop into responsible, independent adults.    ",0
" I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide information and arguments that can help you make an informed decision. There are several arguments for and against becoming a vegetarian, so I will present some of them below:  Arguments for becoming a vegetarian:  Health benefits: A vegetarian diet can be very healthy, as it typically includes a lot of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This can lead to a lower risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and some types of cancer.  Ethical considerations: Many people choose to become vegetarians because they object to the treatment of animals in the meat industry. They believe that it is wrong to kill animals for food and that they should be treated with respect and compassion.  Environmental concerns: The meat industry is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. Choosing a vegetarian diet can be a way to reduce your carbon footprint and help protect the planet.  Arguments against becoming a vegetarian:  Nutritional concerns: A vegetarian diet can be low in certain nutrients, such as iron, vitamin B12, and protein. It is important to make sure you are getting enough of these nutrients through other sources, such as supplements or fortified foods.  Taste preferences: Some people simply enjoy the taste of meat and do not want to give it up. They argue that a vegetarian diet can be bland and unappetizing.  Cultural traditions: In some cultures, meat is a central part of the cuisine and giving it up can be seen as a rejection of those traditions.  Ultimately, whether or not to become a vegetarian is a personal choice that depends on individual beliefs, values, and priorities. It is important to weigh the pros and cons and make an informed decision that works for you.   ",0
" The question of whether Congress should pass legislation requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines is a highly debated one. On one hand, the popularity of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) has led to increased consumption of fuel and higher greenhouse gas emissions, which contributes to climate change. On the other hand, some argue that government intervention in the automotive industry is unnecessary and could have negative economic impacts.  There are several reasons why a law requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines could be beneficial. First and foremost, it could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, with cars and trucks accounting for about one-fifth of the country's total emissions. By increasing fuel efficiency, automobile manufacturers could help reduce these emissions and make a significant impact in the fight against climate change.  Furthermore, a law requiring more fuel-efficient engines could also help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The United States imports about 40% of the oil it consumes, and transportation accounts for about 70% of that consumption. By increasing fuel efficiency, we could decrease our demand for foreign oil and become more energy independent.  However, there are also potential drawbacks to passing such a law. For example, it could increase the cost of vehicles and reduce consumer choice. In addition, some argue that the free market should be left to determine the most efficient and cost-effective solutions, rather than government mandates.  In conclusion, the question of whether Congress should pass legislation requiring automobile manufacturers to use more fuel-efficient engines is a complex one. While there are potential benefits to increasing fuel efficiency, there are also potential drawbacks to government intervention in the automotive industry. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to pass such a law will require careful consideration of all the potential impacts, both positive and negative.  ",0
" On one hand, zoos have been an educational tool for many people around the world. They allow people to observe and learn about animals they may not otherwise have the opportunity to see. Zoos also contribute to conservation efforts, by supporting research and breeding programs to help endangered species. Additionally, many zoos work to provide habitats that mimic the animals' natural environments as closely as possible, ensuring their physical and mental wellbeing.  On the other hand, there are valid concerns about the welfare of animals kept in captivity. Some animals may become stressed, develop abnormal behaviors, or suffer from physical and psychological health problems due to the restricted living conditions in zoos. Furthermore, the process of capturing and transporting animals to zoos can be traumatic, leading to injury or death. Some critics argue that zoos prioritize entertainment over the welfare of animals.  In conclusion, there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate. While zoos can provide educational opportunities and contribute to conservation efforts, it is important to ensure that animals in captivity are treated humanely and provided with adequate living conditions. It is up to individuals to consider these factors when deciding whether or not to support zoos.     ",0
" On the one hand, the law does not prevent individuals with criminal records from running for office in most countries. Disqualifying someone from running for office based solely on their criminal history could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the crime was non-violent or unrelated to their ability to carry out the duties of the office they are seeking. Additionally, some people may argue that individuals who have overcome their past mistakes and demonstrated rehabilitation should not be punished indefinitely for their past actions.  On the other hand, allowing candidates with criminal records to run for office may undermine the public's trust in the political system. Voters may question the integrity and suitability of someone with a criminal record to hold a position of power and make decisions that affect the lives of others. In some cases, a candidate's criminal record may also create a conflict of interest, such as a lawmaker with a history of financial fraud making decisions related to finance and business regulations.  There have been numerous examples of politicians with criminal records being elected to office, including former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to four years in prison, and former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who served time for perjury and obstruction of justice. These cases highlight the complex issues involved in allowing candidates with criminal records to run for office.  Ultimately, the decision to allow candidates with criminal records to run for office should be weighed carefully, taking into account the nature of the crime, the individual's demonstrated rehabilitation, and the potential impact on the public's trust in the political system. It may also be beneficial for countries to establish clear guidelines and regulations regarding the eligibility of individuals with criminal records to run for office.         ",0
" As an AI language model, I do not hold personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide some information to help you form your own opinion on the matter.  On the one hand, businesses that offer essays for sale can be seen as legitimate in the sense that they are providing a service that some students may find useful. For example, students who are struggling with a particular assignment or who do not have enough time to complete their homework may find these services helpful.  However, on the other hand, there are several reasons why these enterprises should be shut down. First and foremost, buying an essay from one of these sites is essentially cheating. Students are not learning the material or developing critical thinking skills, which is the main purpose of homework assignments. Moreover, submitting an essay that was purchased online is a form of academic dishonesty that can result in serious consequences, including failing a course or even expulsion from school.  Additionally, many of these essay writing services may not provide high-quality work. Students who rely on these services may end up with poorly written essays that are plagiarized or do not meet the requirements of the assignment. This can be a waste of money for the student and can ultimately harm their academic performance.  In conclusion, while essay writing services may offer a convenient solution for students who do not want to do their homework, they are not a legitimate way to learn and can lead to serious consequences. It is up to individuals to decide whether they want to engage in these practices or not, but schools and universities have a responsibility to prevent and discourage academic dishonesty.       ",0
" On the one hand, supporters of these exams argue that they provide a standardized and objective way to evaluate a student's academic abilities. These exams cover a range of subjects and skills, including math, reading, and writing, that are essential for success in college. Furthermore, colleges and universities often use these exams as a factor in their admissions decisions, alongside other factors such as GPA and extracurricular activities.  On the other hand, critics of these exams argue that they are not an accurate measure of a student's potential for success in college. Some argue that the exams are culturally biased, and that students from certain socioeconomic backgrounds may not have had the same educational opportunities as those who can afford expensive test preparation courses. Furthermore, some critics argue that these exams do not take into account a student's unique talents and abilities that may not be reflected in a standardized test.  There are also arguments that the SAT and ACT are not always the best predictors of academic success in college. Some studies have shown that a student's high school GPA may be a more accurate predictor of college success than their SAT or ACT scores.  In summary, there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate about the accuracy of the SAT and ACT as measures of a student's aptitude for college. Ultimately, the decision to use these exams as part of the college admissions process is up to each individual college or university.     ",0
" Yes, I agree that we can lie with silence as well as with words. Silence can be used to deceive, manipulate, and conceal the truth just as effectively as words.  For example, consider a scenario where a friend asks another friend if they like their new outfit. The friend doesn't say anything, and their silence can be interpreted in different ways. They might not like the outfit but don't want to hurt their friend's feelings, or they might not care about the outfit at all. Alternatively, they might like the outfit but are too shy to say anything. In any case, their silence can be interpreted in multiple ways, and the interpretation might not be the truth.  Another example is when someone remains silent instead of speaking up when they witness injustice or unethical behavior. This silence can be seen as complicit and can contribute to the perpetuation of harmful actions. In this case, silence is a form of lying by omission.  In conclusion, silence can be just as powerful as words when it comes to conveying meaning, and it can be used to deceive or manipulate just as effectively as words can. It's essential to be aware of the potential for deception through silence and to communicate clearly to avoid misunderstandings.    ",0
" History is often seen as a dry, boring subject by many students, who may wonder why they need to learn about events that happened long ago. However, a deeper look into the study of history reveals that it is an essential part of our education and understanding of the world around us. In this essay, I will explain why learning about the past is important and why it should not be dismissed as irrelevant.  Firstly, history provides us with a sense of identity and belonging. By learning about the past, we can understand the roots of our cultural heritage and the evolution of our societies. We can also appreciate the contributions of our ancestors and the struggles they faced, which have shaped our modern world. Without an understanding of our past, we cannot fully understand ourselves or the world we live in.  Secondly, history teaches us valuable lessons that can be applied to our present and future. By examining past events, we can learn from the successes and failures of our predecessors and make more informed decisions in the present. We can also develop a better understanding of the consequences of our actions and the impact they may have on future generations. For example, the study of past pandemics can help us to prepare for and prevent future outbreaks.  Thirdly, history helps us to develop critical thinking skills. By examining multiple perspectives and sources, we can learn to evaluate evidence, identify biases, and form our own opinions. This is particularly important in today's world, where fake news and misinformation are prevalent. A strong understanding of history can help us to discern truth from fiction and make informed decisions based on reliable information.  Finally, history provides us with a sense of continuity and context. By understanding the past, we can appreciate how the world has evolved and how different events and ideas are connected. We can also understand how our current problems and challenges have roots in the past and how they have been addressed by previous generations. This can provide us with a sense of hope and resilience, knowing that we are part of a larger story and that we can learn from the struggles of those who came before us.  In conclusion, learning about history is essential for a well-rounded education and a deeper understanding of the world around us. It provides us with a sense of identity, teaches us valuable lessons, develops critical thinking skills, and provides us with a sense of continuity and context. While it may not always be the most exciting subject, it is certainly one of the most important, and students should approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn.  ",0
" In my analysis, the statement ""Friendship is the only cement that will hold the world together"" is an idealistic notion that lacks practicality in the real world. While friendship is a crucial factor in building trust and social cohesion, it cannot be the only force holding the world together.  There are many other factors, such as economic ties, political alliances, shared values, and cultural understanding, that are essential for maintaining global stability and peace. For instance, countries often form partnerships and trade agreements based on their mutual economic interests, which are driven by financial gains rather than friendships.  Furthermore, friendships can be transient and subject to change based on individual interests, circumstances, and personality traits. In contrast, the world requires more stable and long-lasting bonds to function smoothly.  Moreover, history has shown that even close friendships cannot always prevent conflicts or wars. For example, during World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies, but after the war, their ideological differences led to the Cold War.  In conclusion, while friendship is an essential ingredient in building relationships, trust, and social cohesion, it cannot be the only force holding the world together. Other factors such as economic, political, and cultural ties are equally crucial. Therefore, the statement made by Woodrow Wilson is an idealistic notion that lacks practicality in the real world.     ",0
" Simmons' quote suggests that if we live only in the present and ignore the consequences of our actions, we may damage our future. This can be true in some cases, particularly when we make impulsive decisions that have negative long-term effects.  On the other hand, living in the moment can also be beneficial for our well-being, as it allows us to fully appreciate the present and find joy in small moments. Moreover, some opportunities may only be available to us in the present moment, and postponing them may lead to regrets in the future.  Therefore, I believe that the quote can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. While it is important to consider the long-term consequences of our actions, we should also learn to find a balance between living in the moment and planning for the future.    ",0
" Thomas Edison's statement suggests that genius is not just about having great ideas or inspiration, but it is more about the hard work and effort put into bringing those ideas to fruition. In other words, Edison emphasizes that successful outcomes require a great deal of work and persistence, not just talent or inspiration.  While it is true that hard work and persistence are essential for achieving success, it is also important to acknowledge that creativity and inspiration are equally crucial. Great ideas and innovative solutions come from inspiration, imagination, and a different perspective on things, which are not necessarily a result of hard work alone.  Therefore, while Thomas Edison's statement highlights the importance of hard work in achieving success, it should not undermine the value of creativity, imagination, and innovation in the process. Both elements are essential in achieving great results, and they complement each other to bring about exceptional outcomes.      ",0
" Music is an art form that transcends time, and as such, it is capable of resonating with people from different generations. The music that I grew up listening to may not be the same as what people from other generations enjoy, but that does not mean that it is not worth listening to. In fact, I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to, even if you are not from the same generation.  One of the reasons why I believe that my generation's music is worth listening to is because of the emotions that it conveys. Music has the power to make us feel things that we may not be able to express in words. The music of my generation speaks to the struggles and challenges that we face as young people trying to navigate a complex and ever-changing world. It addresses issues such as identity, social justice, and mental health, which are relevant not just to my generation but to everyone.  Another reason why my generation's music is worth listening to is that it represents a fusion of different genres and cultures. In today's globalized world, music has become more diverse and eclectic than ever before. My generation's music draws inspiration from various sources, including hip hop, R&B, rock, and electronic dance music. It also incorporates elements from different cultures, such as Latin, African, and Asian music. This diversity of influences makes the music of my generation both unique and exciting.  Finally, my generation's music is worth listening to because it is a reflection of the times we live in. Music has always been a reflection of society, and my generation's music is no different. It reflects the values, beliefs, and attitudes of young people today, who are more socially conscious, politically active, and open-minded than ever before. It is music that celebrates diversity, inclusivity, and equality, and that encourages us to be our best selves.  In conclusion, my generation's music is worth listening to because it speaks to the emotions, represents a fusion of different genres and cultures, and reflects the times we live in. It may not be the same as the music that people from other generations grew up listening to, but that does not mean that it is any less valuable or meaningful. So, I encourage you to give it a chance, and who knows, you might just discover a new favorite song or artist!         ",0
" The statement ""The great man is the man who does a thing for the first time"" suggests that the quality of greatness is associated with novelty and innovation. It implies that the achievement of a person becomes extraordinary and exceptional when they introduce or accomplish something new.  However, this definition has limitations. It doesn't take into account the value and impact of the action performed. It is possible for someone to create something new, but if it has no value or significance, it cannot be considered great. Similarly, there are countless examples of people who have made significant contributions by building upon the work of others or improving upon existing concepts, without necessarily being the first to do so.  Therefore, while novelty and originality can be impressive, the quality of greatness cannot be solely defined by doing something for the first time. It should also consider the value and impact of the action in question.       ",0
" The statement made by Samuel Johnson, ""Ignorance, when voluntary, is criminal,"" implies that people who choose to remain ignorant of important information or knowledge can be held accountable for their actions. In some cases, this may be true, as deliberate ignorance can lead to harmful or unethical decisions.  For example, a doctor who intentionally ignores new medical research and continues to use outdated practices that harm their patients could be considered criminally negligent. Similarly, a politician who refuses to educate themselves on important policy issues and makes uninformed decisions that negatively impact their constituents could be held accountable for their ignorance.  However, it's important to note that not all cases of ignorance can be considered criminal. Some people may not have access to certain information or may not have the resources to educate themselves. In such cases, it would be unfair to hold them responsible for their ignorance.  Moreover, ignorance is not always a voluntary choice. Many people are born into situations where they are deprived of education or exposed only to biased or incomplete information. In such cases, it would be unjust to consider their ignorance criminal.  In conclusion, while Samuel Johnson's statement may hold true in some cases, it's important to consider the context and circumstances surrounding the ignorance in question. Ultimately, it is important for individuals to make a conscious effort to educate themselves and remain informed, as ignorance can have far-reaching consequences.    ",0
" Some argue that requiring students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance is a patriotic tradition that instills a sense of national pride and unity. It is seen as a way to promote respect for the country and its values. Those who support the mandatory recitation of the pledge also argue that it is a way to honor the sacrifices of the men and women who have fought for the country's freedoms.  On the other hand, opponents of the mandatory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance argue that it violates the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. They believe that forcing students to say the pledge goes against the principles of democracy, which allows individuals to express their opinions and beliefs freely. Moreover, some people argue that reciting the pledge in schools is a form of nationalism that is exclusionary to non-American students or students who do not share the same values as those expressed in the pledge.  Ultimately, whether the Pledge of Allegiance should be mandatory or voluntary depends on one's interpretation of patriotism and freedom of speech. Some people may see mandatory recitation as a way to instill values of loyalty and respect for the country, while others may view it as a form of forced patriotism that goes against the principles of democracy. Whatever the case may be, it is important to ensure that students' constitutional rights are respected, and that they have the freedom to express themselves in a way that aligns with their beliefs and values.

" The current U.S. tax system is progressive, which means that individuals with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes. The argument for a flat tax system is that it would simplify the tax code and create a fairer system in which everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes.  Proponents of the flat tax argue that it would eliminate the need for complicated tax forms and reduce the compliance costs associated with the current system. They also argue that it would be fairer because everyone would be contributing the same percentage of their income, regardless of their income level.  However, opponents of the flat tax argue that it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and hurt low-income individuals. Under a flat tax system, individuals with high incomes would pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than they currently do, while low-income individuals would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This could exacerbate income inequality and make it harder for low-income individuals to make ends meet.  Furthermore, the current progressive tax system is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially. For example, low-income individuals are often eligible for tax credits and other benefits that can help them make ends meet. A flat tax system would eliminate these benefits, making it harder for low-income individuals to get by.  In conclusion, the choice between a progressive and flat tax system ultimately comes down to values and priorities. While a flat tax system may simplify the tax code, it may also exacerbate income inequality and hurt low-income individuals. The current progressive tax system, while more complicated, is designed to provide a safety net for those who are struggling financially.      ",0
" Kettering's statement implies that progress comes with challenges and difficulties, which is often true. Many technological advancements have brought significant benefits to society but also caused problems and challenges that needed to be addressed.  For example, the development of the automobile revolutionized transportation and helped people travel more efficiently and comfortably. However, it also brought challenges such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and accidents that needed to be addressed through regulation and innovation.  Similarly, the rise of the internet and digital technology has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate. But it also brings challenges like online privacy, cybercrime, and addiction.  Therefore, while progress has undoubtedly brought many benefits, it has also caused problems that require solutions. To minimize the negative impact of progress, it is essential to anticipate and address the challenges that may arise. It is important to develop policies and regulations to ensure that the benefits of progress are widely shared and that the adverse effects are mitigated.  In conclusion, progress indeed comes with challenges and difficulties, as Charles F. Kettering said. However, it is possible to manage and address these challenges through innovation, regulation, and collaboration.     ",0
" Thomas Mann's assertion that war is a cowardly escape from the problems of peace suggests that nations and leaders may choose to resort to war as a way of avoiding difficult political or economic challenges. This statement reflects a pacifist perspective that regards war as a destructive force that causes immense human suffering and destruction.  While it is true that wars often arise out of political and economic difficulties, it would be too simplistic to assert that war is always a cowardly escape. In some instances, war may be an inevitable response to threats to national security or to protect the basic human rights of a group of people. For example, the Allies fought in World War II to defend against the aggression of Nazi Germany and to stop the atrocities committed against Jews and other minorities.  However, it is also true that many wars have been fought for reasons that were not necessarily justifiable. For example, the Vietnam War was fought primarily to contain the spread of communism, but it caused immense suffering for the Vietnamese people and resulted in many American casualties. Similarly, the Iraq War was waged under the false pretext of weapons of mass destruction and resulted in the deaths of thousands of Iraqis and Americans.  In conclusion, while war may be a necessary response in some instances, it is often a destructive and avoidable tragedy. The decision to go to war should be made only after careful consideration of all other options and with a clear understanding of the costs and consequences. Ultimately, peace should be the goal of all nations, and efforts should be made to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and peaceful means whenever possible.    ",0
" Jeannette Rankin's statement suggests that war and natural disasters such as earthquakes are both uncontrollable forces, and it is impossible to emerge as a clear winner from either of them. While this statement may hold some truth, it oversimplifies the complexities of war and natural disasters.  Winning a war involves a lot more than just military might. Political alliances, economic power, social support, and strategic planning all play a role in determining the outcome of a war. Moreover, wars can also lead to diplomatic victories, where the warring parties can reach a peaceful settlement or an agreement that benefits both sides.  On the other hand, natural disasters such as earthquakes are indeed uncontrollable forces that can cause widespread damage and loss of life. However, the impact of a natural disaster can be minimized through proper planning, preparation, and response. Effective disaster management strategies can save lives, reduce damage, and help communities recover faster.  In conclusion, while there may be some truth to Jeannette Rankin's statement, it oversimplifies the complexities of war and natural disasters. Winning a war or managing a natural disaster requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account a range of factors, including political, economic, and social factors, as well as planning and preparedness.

" However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach writing an essay explaining why someone should be admitted to a particular college.  When applying to college, the essay is an essential part of the application process as it provides a chance for the applicant to showcase their personality, character, and achievements beyond their academic record. It is an opportunity to present yourself as a unique individual with a distinct voice, values, and aspirations. Therefore, a successful essay should be authentic, engaging, and well-written.  To write an essay that persuades the admission committee that you are a worthy candidate, you need to do some research on the college, its values, mission, and culture. Understanding the institution's ethos will allow you to tailor your essay to demonstrate how your interests, experiences, and goals align with theirs. For example, if the college has a strong emphasis on community service, you can highlight your volunteer work or involvement in charity organizations.

By following these guidelines, you will be able to write an essay that showcases your unique personality and stands out from the rest of the applicants.    ",0
" The statement made by Seneca, ""A great fortune is a great slavery,"" implies that wealth can become a burden and limit one's freedom. While wealth may bring financial security and comfort, it can also come with a variety of responsibilities and pressures.  One way in which wealth can become a form of slavery is through the need to maintain it. Maintaining a lavish lifestyle, managing investments, and ensuring the longevity of wealth can all become consuming tasks, taking up significant amounts of time and energy. In this sense, wealth can become a burden, limiting an individual's freedom to pursue other interests or activities.  Moreover, great fortune can also create social pressures and expectations that may be difficult to meet. It can lead to an unending cycle of material desires and the need to impress others, which can result in stress, anxiety, and even loss of privacy.  On the other hand, there are many people who have managed to maintain their wealth and still lead fulfilling lives. In some cases, wealth can provide individuals with the freedom to pursue their passions, travel, and engage in philanthropic activities. The key is finding a balance between wealth and one's personal values and priorities.  In conclusion, Seneca's statement highlights the potential dangers of great fortune. While wealth can bring many benefits, it can also lead to a loss of freedom and create additional responsibilities and pressures. It is essential to find a balance and use one's wealth wisely to avoid becoming a slave to it.   ",0
" Learning a foreign language can be one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime. It opens doors to new cultures, expands one's understanding of the world, and can even improve cognitive abilities. With so many languages to choose from, the decision of which one to learn can be overwhelming. However, in my opinion, if readers were to learn a foreign language, they should consider learning Spanish.  Spanish is the second most widely spoken language in the world, with approximately 460 million native speakers. It is the official language of 21 countries, including Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and many others. In the United States alone, there are over 41 million Spanish speakers, making it the second most spoken language after English. This means that learning Spanish can provide readers with the ability to communicate with a significant portion of the global population and open up numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.  From a cultural perspective, Spanish is rich in literature, music, and art. Spanish authors such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda, and Isabel Allende have produced some of the most celebrated works of modern literature, including magical realism, poetry, and fiction. Spanish-speaking countries have also produced some of the world's most famous artists, including Pablo Picasso, Diego Velazquez, and Frida Kahlo.  Additionally, Spanish is a language that is relatively easy to learn for English speakers. This is because Spanish shares many words with English and has a similar grammatical structure. The Spanish alphabet is also the same as the English alphabet, with the addition of the ñ. This means that learners can quickly gain proficiency in the language, making it a great language to learn for both beginners and those who already have some knowledge of the language.  Moreover, learning Spanish can also have practical benefits. Many employers are looking for bilingual employees, and knowing Spanish can give readers a competitive advantage in the job market. Spanish is especially valuable in industries such as healthcare, education, and hospitality, where there is a high demand for bilingual employees.  Finally, learning Spanish can be a fun and rewarding experience. It provides the opportunity to connect with Spanish-speaking communities, both locally and abroad. Readers can use Spanish to travel to Spanish-speaking countries and communicate with locals, making their travels more immersive and fulfilling. They can also use Spanish to make new friends, learn about new cultures, and expand their horizons.  In conclusion, Spanish is a valuable language to learn for many reasons. It is widely spoken, culturally rich, relatively easy to learn, and can provide numerous personal and professional benefits. Therefore, I highly recommend that readers consider learning Spanish as their foreign language of choice. With so many resources available online, such as language learning apps and online courses, there has never been a better time to start learning Spanish.  ",0
" The issue of labeling albums with explicit content warnings has been a controversial topic for decades. While some argue that labeling is enough to warn parents about inappropriate lyrics, others believe that more needs to be done.  One potential solution would be for the record industry to implement a rating system similar to the movie industry. This would involve assigning ratings to albums based on the content, such as ""PG-13"" or ""R"" ratings. This would allow parents to make more informed decisions about what their children are exposed to.  Another potential solution would be for the record industry to provide more detailed information about the content of each album on their websites or in stores. This could include providing a list of all songs with explicit content and a brief explanation of why they are labeled as such.  Ultimately, the best solution may be a combination of these approaches. By providing more information and implementing a rating system, parents would have more tools to make informed decisions about the media their children consume.  ",0
" Building a space station on either the Moon or Mars would be a significant achievement for humanity and would offer several advantages. One of the most significant advantages would be to establish a foothold on another planet, which could be a critical step towards human colonization of space.  Furthermore, a space station on the Moon or Mars could serve as a scientific research facility, allowing scientists to conduct experiments in low-gravity environments and study the geology, climate, and other characteristics of these planets. Such research could help us better understand the formation and evolution of the solar system and provide new insights into the origins of life.  Moreover, a space station on the Moon or Mars could be a launching pad for further exploration of the solar system. It could serve as a base for manned missions to other planets and moons, and for the development of new technologies and propulsion systems that could enable us to travel further and faster in space.  However, there are also significant challenges associated with building a space station on the Moon or Mars. One of the most significant challenges is the cost. Building a space station on another planet would require significant investment in research and development, engineering, and construction. The cost could be in the billions of dollars or more.

" I do not have personal preferences or biases. However, I can provide you with some objective information to help you make a decision between leasing or buying a new car based on your financial situation, driving habits, and preferences.  Leasing a car may be a better option if you prefer to drive a new car every few years and do not want to deal with the hassle of selling your vehicle. Lease payments are generally lower than car loan payments, and you can often get a higher-end vehicle for the same monthly payment as a lower-end car purchase. Additionally, you may have lower repair costs since the vehicle is usually covered under warranty during the lease term. However, keep in mind that you will not own the car at the end of the lease term, and there may be additional fees for excess mileage or wear and tear.  Buying a new car may be a better option if you want to own your vehicle outright and keep it for a longer period. With a car loan, you can spread out the cost of the vehicle over several years and may end up paying less in interest than you would with a lease. You also have more flexibility in terms of customization and modifications to the car. However, you may face higher repair costs once the vehicle is no longer covered under warranty, and you will have to deal with selling or trading in the vehicle when you are ready for a new one.  Ultimately, the decision between leasing or buying a new car depends on your personal circumstances and preferences. Consider your budget, driving habits, and long-term goals before making a decision. You may also want to consult with a financial advisor to determine the best option for your specific situation.

" Benjamin Franklin's statement suggests that money cannot bring happiness. While it is true that money alone cannot guarantee happiness, it is also true that financial stability and security can contribute significantly to a person's overall well-being. Studies have shown that poverty and financial stress are strongly associated with negative health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, and physical health problems.  On the other hand, it is also true that having a large amount of money does not necessarily lead to happiness. Many wealthy people still struggle with mental health issues, relationship problems, and other personal challenges that money cannot solve.  In essence, the relationship between money and happiness is complex and multifaceted. While financial stability and security can improve a person's well-being, it is only one factor among many that contribute to overall happiness. Other factors, such as relationships, purpose, and a sense of meaning and fulfillment, are also essential to a happy life.  Ultimately, the role of money in happiness depends on the individual and their unique circumstances. For some people, financial stability may be a crucial factor in their happiness, while for others, it may not matter as much. It is important to recognize that happiness is a subjective experience and cannot be reduced to any single factor, including money.         ",0
" The use of cell phones while driving can distract drivers and increase the risk of accidents. Studies have shown that talking on a hand-held phone while driving can be just as dangerous as driving while under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, the implementation of laws prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones while driving can potentially reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by distracted driving.  In addition, the use of hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth or speakerphone, can provide a safer alternative for drivers who need to make or receive phone calls while driving. In fact, some states have implemented laws that allow for the use of hands-free devices while driving, but still prohibit the use of hand-held devices.  However, some individuals may argue that these laws may infringe on their personal freedom and that the enforcement of such laws may be difficult. Additionally, some may argue that the use of cell phones while driving is not the only source of distraction and that other forms of distraction, such as eating or adjusting the radio, should also be addressed.  Ultimately, the decision to pass laws prohibiting the use of hand-held cell phones while driving is up to each individual state, and it should take into consideration the potential benefits and drawbacks of such laws.

" Argument for expanded science requirement: Science education is critical for students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills that are essential for their future careers. In today's technology-driven world, science is increasingly important in many fields, including medicine, engineering, and computer science. Therefore, it is important for students to have a strong foundation in science to prepare them for these fields. By expanding the science requirement in secondary schools, students will have the opportunity to take more science classes, and thus, gain a deeper understanding of science concepts and develop a greater appreciation for the importance of science in their lives.  Argument against expanded science requirement: While science education is important, expanding the science requirement may not be the best way to achieve this goal. Students have different interests and career aspirations, and requiring them to take more science classes may not be the most effective way to engage them. Additionally, some students may struggle with science classes and may feel discouraged from pursuing science-related careers if they are forced to take more science classes than they are comfortable with. Instead of expanding the science requirement, schools should focus on improving the quality of science education and offering more science electives that cater to different interests and abilities.  In conclusion, whether an expanded science requirement in secondary schools is a good idea or not depends on various factors such as the quality of science education and the interests and abilities of the students. It is important for schools to strike a balance between providing a solid foundation in science education and allowing students to explore their interests and passions.          ",0
" On the one hand, machines have undoubtedly eliminated much of the manual labor previously required in various industries, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. Automation has brought about many benefits, including faster production times, reduced labor costs, and improved quality control. For example, in the manufacturing sector, machines can produce items with greater accuracy and speed than humans, and robots can perform repetitive tasks with consistency and precision.  On the other hand, the widespread adoption of machines has led to the displacement of many workers who were once employed in industries that have become automated. This displacement can lead to unemployment and social upheaval, particularly in regions where industries have been the main source of employment. Additionally, machines can eliminate the need for skills previously required for certain jobs, leading to a potential loss of expertise and knowledge. For example, a farmer who previously had to know how to harvest crops by hand may no longer require that skill with the advent of harvesting machines.  In conclusion, while machines have brought about significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and productivity, they have also resulted in significant job displacement and the potential loss of skills and expertise. Therefore, it's essential to find a balance between technological advancement and the preservation of skills and knowledge, ensuring that the benefits of automation are equitably distributed.

" The Greek proverb ""All things good to know are difficult to learn"" suggests that acquiring knowledge requires effort and challenges. While it is true that some subjects or skills may require more effort to learn, it is not always the case that the most valuable or important things are the most challenging.  For instance, learning a new language or mastering a musical instrument can be challenging and time-consuming, but they may not be the most crucial things to know in life. On the other hand, some critical life skills such as communication, empathy, and decision-making may not be difficult to learn, but they are incredibly valuable to know.  Moreover, the proverb implies that the difficulty of learning something makes it more valuable. However, the value of knowledge is subjective and varies depending on the person's interests, needs, and goals. For example, learning computer programming may be challenging for some people, but if it does not align with their interests or career aspirations, it may not be as valuable to them as it is to others.  In conclusion, while some things may be difficult to learn, it is not always the case that the most important or valuable things are the most challenging. The value of knowledge is subjective and depends on individual interests, needs, and goals.             ",0
" Hazlitt's statement suggests that humans have a natural inclination to act out their roles, and this is where they feel the most comfortable and genuine. From my perspective, there is some truth in this statement. People are social animals, and as such, they tend to adopt various roles in their interactions with others. These roles can be influenced by different factors, such as cultural background, social class, and personal preferences.  For example, a person who works in a corporate environment may adopt a professional persona at work, which involves wearing formal clothes, using formal language, and following established rules of conduct. This role may feel natural to the person because it aligns with their professional goals and aspirations. Similarly, a person who is a parent may adopt a nurturing and caring persona towards their children, which reflects their desire to provide a safe and supportive environment for their family.  However, while it is true that people adopt various roles in their lives, it is not necessarily the case that they are never truly themselves outside of these roles. People have multifaceted personalities and can express different aspects of themselves in different situations. Moreover, there are times when people feel the most genuine and authentic when they are not acting out any particular role. For example, when a person is alone, pursuing a personal interest, or spending time with close friends or family, they may feel the most comfortable and true to themselves.  In conclusion, while it is true that humans tend to adopt various roles in their interactions with others, it is not accurate to say that they are never truly themselves outside of these roles. People have multifaceted personalities and can express different aspects of themselves in different situations. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between adopting roles and being true to oneself.            ",0

" Dear Roommate,  I understand that you do not want any pets in our new apartment, but I want to make a case for why I believe having a pet could be a great addition to our home.  First and foremost, owning a pet has been shown to have numerous health benefits. Pets provide companionship and can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and anxiety. They can also encourage physical activity and help reduce stress levels. In fact, studies have shown that pet owners have lower blood pressure and are less likely to suffer from depression than those without pets.  Furthermore, having a pet can also help us create a more welcoming and comfortable living space. Pets have a way of making a house feel like a home. They can provide a sense of security and warmth that is hard to replicate with any other kind of decoration or furniture.  I understand that there are concerns about the potential mess and disruption that a pet might cause, but I assure you that I am willing to take full responsibility for our pet's care and behavior. I will make sure that our pet is well-trained, groomed, and house-trained. I will also ensure that our pet does not damage any property or cause any disturbances to our neighbors.  In fact, there are many breeds of pets that are well-suited for apartment living and require minimal space and exercise. For example, a small or medium-sized dog, such as a pug or a French bulldog, would be a great choice for our apartment. Alternatively, a cat or a hamster would be low-maintenance options that would not require much space or attention.  I believe that allowing a pet in our home would be a great decision, and I hope that you will reconsider your stance on this issue. I am happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have and am willing to work with you to find a pet that is suitable for our living situation.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my request.  Sincerely,          ",0
" The proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" suggests that it is preferable to be comforted by a falsehood rather than being hurt by the truth. While this statement may seem to offer temporary relief, I don't agree with this proverb.  In the long run, it is always better to confront the truth, even if it may be painful initially. Facing reality and accepting the truth allows us to understand and address problems properly. Ignoring the truth or living in a world of illusions can lead to negative consequences. In some situations, choosing to believe a lie can have serious consequences, such as financial losses or even physical harm.  For example, let's say someone's friend is addicted to drugs, but they keep denying their addiction. If the friend tells them a lie that their behavior is normal or acceptable, it might temporarily make them feel better, but it doesn't solve the problem. Eventually, the truth will come out, and the situation will be much worse than if the friend had been honest from the beginning.  Another example is in a business context. If a company's financial reports are inaccurate, but the CEO chooses to ignore the truth and present them as positive to investors, it can have catastrophic consequences in the long run.  In conclusion, the proverb ""Better a lie that soothes than a truth that hurts"" may provide temporary relief, but it is not a wise or sustainable way to deal with problems. It is better to face the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be, and work towards finding a solution.               ",0
" Dear School Officials,  I am writing this letter to express my concern and disappointment regarding the recent decision to disband the club to which I belong. As a student who has been actively involved in this organization for some time now, I strongly urge you to reconsider this decision.  The club in question has been an integral part of our school's community for many years. It has provided a platform for students to come together, share their interests, and develop new skills. More importantly, it has served as a safe space for students who feel marginalized or left out of mainstream activities.  I understand that the decision to disband the club may have been made due to financial or logistical reasons. However, I believe that the benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding this club, you are taking away a vital resource for students who need it the most. You are also depriving the school of a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture.  Furthermore, the club has been successful in achieving its goals and has made significant contributions to our school. For example, the club has organized several events that have raised awareness about important social issues and have even raised funds for various charitable causes. The club has also been responsible for initiating several projects that have had a positive impact on the school community.  In conclusion, I urge you to reconsider the decision to disband the club. The benefits of keeping the club far outweigh any challenges that it may pose. By disbanding the club, you are depriving students of a vital resource and taking away a vibrant community that has contributed positively to our campus culture. I believe that with some effort and support, the club can continue to thrive and make a positive impact on our school community.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.             ",0
" On one hand, supporters of original fairy tales argue that they are beneficial for children because they address their real fears, feelings, and desires. These tales often include violence, death, and other dark themes, which can help children understand and process difficult emotions and experiences. For example, the story of Cinderella portrays the mistreatment and oppression of a young girl, but ultimately ends with justice and triumph, which can empower children who may relate to her situation.  On the other hand, critics of original fairy tales argue that they can be too violent and disturbing for children, and that sanitized versions can still convey the main themes of the tales in a more appropriate manner. These versions may remove or soften the violence and other dark elements, while still maintaining the core message of the story. For example, the Disney version of Beauty and the Beast retains the theme of looking beyond external appearances to find inner beauty and goodness, but removes some of the violence and darker elements of the original tale.  Ultimately, the appropriateness of original or sanitized fairy tales for children may depend on the individual child and their developmental stage. Some children may be able to handle the darker elements of original fairy tales, while others may find them too overwhelming or disturbing. It may be up to parents, caregivers, and educators to decide which versions of fairy tales are appropriate for the children in their care, taking into consideration their individual needs and sensitivities.

" In my opinion, study hall is not a waste of time and can be a necessary break from regular classes. Here are some reasons and examples to support this position:  Time for completing homework: Study hall allows students to use their time wisely and complete homework, assignments, or projects they may not have had time to finish at home. It can also help students who struggle with time management to better organize their workload.  Opportunity for focused study: Study hall can provide a quiet and focused environment for students to study for upcoming exams or quizzes without distractions from home or other classes.  Opportunity for extra help: During study hall, students can ask their teachers for extra help or clarification on topics they may not have understood in class. This can help improve their understanding and boost their grades.  Break from regular classes: Study hall can provide a necessary break from regular classes, which can be mentally exhausting. It can also give students a chance to decompress and reduce stress levels.  Time for extracurricular activities: If students do not have any unfinished work, study hall can also give them time to participate in extracurricular activities such as clubs, sports, or music. This can provide a much-needed break from academic work and promote a healthy balance of activities.  In conclusion, study hall is not a waste of time but a necessary break from regular classes. It provides students with opportunities to complete unfinished work, study, seek extra help, and participate in extracurricular activities.                 ",0
" I understand that having money in your savings account may not seem like a priority right now, but I want to emphasize how important it is to create and follow through with a savings plan. Here are a few reasons why:  Emergencies can happen at any time: You never know when you might need extra cash to cover unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, medical bills, or job loss. Having a savings account can give you peace of mind knowing that you have a safety net to fall back on when times get tough.  It can help you achieve your long-term goals: Whether you're saving for a down payment on a house, a dream vacation, or retirement, having a savings plan in place can help you reach those goals faster. By setting aside a little bit of money each month, you can make steady progress towards your financial aspirations.  It can help you avoid debt: If you don't have money saved up, you may have to rely on credit cards or loans to cover unexpected expenses. This can lead to a cycle of debt that is difficult to break free from. By having money saved up, you can avoid going into debt in the first place.  I know that saving money can be difficult, especially if you're living paycheck to paycheck. However, even small contributions to a savings account can add up over time. By creating a budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, and finding ways to increase your income, you can start building your savings account and securing your financial future.  Remember, it's never too late to start saving. Even if you can only set aside a small amount each month, every little bit counts.

" Some people argue that it is not appropriate to deceive children by pretending that Santa Claus is real. They believe that children may feel betrayed when they eventually learn the truth and may lose trust in their parents and other adults.  On the other hand, supporters of the Santa Claus tradition argue that it is a harmless and fun way to celebrate the holiday season. They believe that the story of Santa Claus adds to the magic and excitement of Christmas, and helps to create happy memories for children.  In the end, whether or not children should be led to believe in Santa Claus is a personal decision that each family must make. Some families choose to embrace the tradition while others do not. Regardless of one's personal beliefs, it is important to always prioritize the well-being and happiness of children.               ",0
"  Throughout history, many people have fought for various causes, some of which have had a significant impact on society. Whether it be civil rights, gender equality, or environmental sustainability, there are many issues that are worth fighting for. However, one cause that I believe is particularly important to fight for is global poverty reduction.  Poverty is a pervasive and complex issue that affects millions of people around the world. According to the World Bank, around 9.2% of the global population, or roughly 689 million people, live in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day. This number is even higher when taking into account those who live just above the poverty line but still struggle to make ends meet. Poverty can lead to a host of other issues, such as hunger, malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and limited educational opportunities. It is a cycle that can be difficult to break out of, particularly for those living in developing countries where access to resources and opportunities is limited.  Fighting global poverty is worth the effort because it is a moral imperative. As human beings, we have a responsibility to help those who are less fortunate than ourselves. It is unjust that some people have to suffer from poverty while others have access to abundance. By fighting poverty, we are not only improving the lives of individuals, but we are also creating a more just and equitable world.  Furthermore, reducing global poverty has significant benefits for everyone, not just those who are directly affected by it. Poverty reduction leads to economic growth and stability, as it allows more people to participate in the economy and contribute to their communities. It also promotes political stability and reduces the likelihood of conflict, as people who are struggling to survive are more likely to engage in criminal or violent behavior. Additionally, poverty reduction is good for the environment, as people who are living in poverty often have to resort to harmful practices to survive, such as deforestation or overfishing.  There are many ways to fight global poverty, including through foreign aid, trade policies, and investment in education and healthcare. It requires a concerted effort from governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals alike. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense.  In conclusion, fighting global poverty is a cause that is worth fighting for. It is a moral imperative that promotes justice and equity, and it has significant benefits for everyone. By reducing poverty, we can create a more stable and sustainable world. It is a long-term project that requires sustained investment and commitment, but the rewards are immense. As individuals, we can support organizations that work to reduce poverty, advocate for policies that promote poverty reduction, and educate ourselves and others about the issue. Together, we can make a difference and create a better world for all.              ",0

" Outdoor living is a lifestyle that involves spending more time outside in natural settings, such as gardens, patios, porches, pools, decks or balconies. It can also include activities like cooking, dining, entertaining, relaxing or gardening outdoors. Outdoor living can provide many benefits, such as improving your mood, health, social life and connection with nature1.  Some examples of outdoor living are:  Having an outdoor kitchen with a grill, prep station, countertop and mini fridge1. Enjoying a fire pit or a hot tub on cooler nights1. Creating a cozy cottage garden with rustic walkways and colorful flowers2. Installing a pergola or a gazebo for shade and privacy1. Adding a water feature or a fountain for soothing sounds and ambiance1. If you have an apartment in the city, you can still enjoy outdoor living by creating a small balcony garden with potted plants, herbs, hanging baskets or vertical planters. You can also add some outdoor furniture, such as a bistro table, chairs, cushions or a hammock. You can use solar lights, candles or lanterns to create a cozy atmosphere at night. You can also join a community garden or a park nearby to grow your own vegetables or flowers and meet other people who share your interest in outdoor living           ",0
" Two people of different interests and backgrounds could become unlikely allies if they share a common goal, face a common enemy, or recognize a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies are those who overcome their differences and cooperate for a greater cause, often in times of crisis, challenge, or opportunity. History and literature are full of examples of unlikely allies who joined forces to achieve remarkable outcomes.  One of the most famous examples of unlikely allies is the alliance between Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin during World War II. These three leaders represented different political systems, ideologies, and cultures, and had many conflicts and suspicions among them. However, they realized that they had to work together to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies, who posed an existential threat to their nations and the world. Despite their disagreements and mistrust, they coordinated their military strategies, shared intelligence and resources, and negotiated the post-war order. Their alliance was crucial for winning the war and shaping the modern world[^1^][1].  Another example of unlikely allies is the partnership between mPedigree, a social enterprise that fights counterfeit drugs in Africa, and several multinational pharmaceutical companies. mPedigree developed a technology that allows consumers to verify the authenticity of their medicines by sending a code on the package to a free number and receiving an instant response. This innovation has saved many lives and reduced the market for fake drugs. However, mPedigree faced resistance from some drug manufacturers who feared that their products would be exposed as counterfeit or substandard. To overcome this challenge, mPedigree approached some of the leading pharmaceutical companies and convinced them to adopt its technology as a way to protect their brands, increase their sales, and improve their reputation. By collaborating with mPedigree, these companies became unlikely allies in the fight against counterfeit drugs and improved their social impact[^2^][3].  A third example of unlikely allies is the friendship between Huck Finn and Jim in Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Huck is a white boy who runs away from his abusive father and Jim is a black slave who escapes from his owner. They meet on an island in the Mississippi River and decide to raft together to find freedom. Along their journey, they face many dangers, challenges, and prejudices, but they also learn from each other and grow closer. Huck overcomes his racial biases and sees Jim as a human being worthy of respect and compassion. Jim becomes a father figure and a loyal friend to Huck. They become unlikely allies in their quest for liberty and happiness.  These examples show that two people of different interests and backgrounds can become unlikely allies if they have a compelling reason to do so. Unlikely allies can overcome their differences and achieve remarkable outcomes by working together for a common goal, facing a common enemy, or recognizing a mutual benefit. Unlikely allies can also enrich each other's lives by learning from each other's perspectives and experiences.         ",0
" A family celebration that has special meaning for me is the annual reunion that we have every summer. This tradition started when I was a child and my grandparents decided to invite all their children and grandchildren to their farm for a week of fun and bonding. It was a way of keeping the family connected and passing on the family’s values, history, and culture1.  Every year, we look forward to this family gathering as a time to catch up with our relatives, share stories, play games, and enjoy delicious food. Some of the activities that we do together are:  Cooking a big barbecue on the first night and having a bonfire with marshmallows and hot chocolate2. Going on a hayride around the farm and visiting the animals. Playing board games or puzzles that we get as gifts from our grandparents2. Watching a movie together on a projector screen in the barn. Having a talent show where everyone showcases their skills or talents. Taking a family photo in matching pajamas that we also get from our grandparents2. These family traditions are very meaningful to me because they make me feel part of a larger community that loves and supports me. They also give me a sense of identity and belonging as I learn more about my family’s roots and heritage. They also create positive memories that I can cherish for a lifetime.  I hope to continue this tradition with my own children someday and pass on the values and culture that I learned from my grandparents. I think family celebrations are important for developing a healthy and happy family unit and strengthening the bonds between generations        ",0

She also has four Olympic gold medals and one bronze from the 2016 Rio Games.

" Obesity is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects millions of people around the world. It is defined as having an excessive amount of body fat that poses a risk to health. Obesity can lead to both personal and societal problems, such as:  Personal problems: People with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health problems, including: heart disease and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, certain cancers, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, gallstones, fatty liver disease, kidney disease, pregnancy complications, and mental health issues such as depression and low self-esteem12. Obesity can also affect the quality of life and well-being of individuals by limiting their mobility, social interactions, and opportunities for education and employment. Obesity can also increase the risk of discrimination, stigma, and bullying2. Societal problems: Obesity can have a significant impact on the society as a whole by increasing the burden on the health care system, the economy, and the environment. Obesity can increase the costs of health care services and medications due to the increased prevalence and severity of obesity-related diseases1. Obesity can also reduce the productivity and income of individuals and businesses due to absenteeism, presenteeism (working while sick), disability, and premature mortality2. Obesity can also contribute to environmental degradation by increasing the demand for food, energy, water, and land resources2. Therefore, obesity is not just a personal issue but a public health challenge that requires collective action and responsibility. A comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes and consequences of obesity is needed to prevent and manage this problem effectively. Such an approach should include strategies that promote healthy eating habits, physical activity, behavioral change, environmental modification, policy intervention, education and awareness, and medical treatment12. By working together, we can create a healthier and more sustainable future for ourselves and our society.      ",0

Each island has its own charm and beauty, but they all share some common features: white-washed houses, blue-domed churches, and breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. I would spend my days on the island swimming in the crystal-clear water, sunbathing on the sandy beaches, and hiking on the volcanic trails. I would also explore the villages and towns on the island, where I could admire the architecture, visit the museums and galleries, and interact with the locals.  At night, I would enjoy the vibrant nightlife on the island, where I could dance at the clubs, listen to live music at the bars, or watch a movie at an open-air cinema. I would also sample the delicious Greek cuisine, such as moussaka, souvlaki, and baklava. I would try some of the local wines and spirits, such as ouzo and retsina.

" I can try to generate an essay example for you based on the search results. Here is what I came up with:  A Change of Plans  Life is full of surprises and sometimes things do not go according to our plans. We may have to face unexpected challenges or opportunities that require us to adapt and change our course of action. In this essay, I will describe a situation where a change of plans became necessary and how I dealt with it.  Last year, I had planned to go on a vacation with my family to Hawaii. We had booked our flights and hotel months in advance and were looking forward to enjoying the sun, sand and sea. However, a week before our departure date, we received some bad news. My grandfather, who lived in another state, had suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. He was in critical condition and the doctors were not sure if he would survive.  My family and I were shocked and saddened by this news. We decided to cancel our vacation and fly to see my grandfather instead. We had to pay a lot of fees for changing our flights and hotel reservations, but we did not care about the money. We just wanted to be with him and support him.  We arrived at the hospital and saw my grandfather lying on a bed with tubes and wires attached to him. He looked pale and weak, but he recognized us and smiled faintly. We hugged him and told him how much we loved him. He could not speak much, but he squeezed our hands and nodded. We stayed with him for a few days, talking to him, reading to him, praying for him.  On the third day, we received some good news. The doctors said that my grandfather had shown some signs of improvement and that he might recover. They said that he would need a lot of rehabilitation and care, but he had a chance to live a normal life again. We were overjoyed and thanked them for their efforts.  We decided to stay with my grandfather for another week until he was stable enough to be transferred to a rehabilitation center. We helped him with his exercises, fed him, bathed him, cheered him up. He gradually regained some of his strength and speech. He thanked us for being there for him and said that we were his angels.  We finally returned home after two weeks of being away. We missed our vacation, but we did not regret our decision. We were glad that we could be with my grandfather when he needed us most. We learned that family is more important than anything else and that we should cherish every moment we have with them.  We also learned that life is unpredictable and that we should be flexible and adaptable when things change. We realized that sometimes a change of plans can be a blessing in disguise and lead us to something better than what we had planned.   ",0

" Teenage smoking is a serious issue that can have lasting consequences for the health and well-being of young people. Some possible causes and problems resulting from teenage smoking are:  Causes: Teenagers may start smoking for various reasons, such as peer pressure, curiosity, imitation of family members or friends, stress relief, rebellion, or low self-esteem1. Some teenagers may also be influenced by the media, especially movies that portray smoking as cool or glamorous1 . Problems: Smoking can harm almost every organ in the body and increase the risk of many diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, lung disease, stroke, and diabetes1. Smoking can also affect the appearance, fitness, and sexual health of teenagers2. For example, smoking can cause bad breath, yellow teeth, wrinkled skin, gum disease, eye problems, reduced lung capacity, and impotence2. Moreover, smoking can lead to addiction and dependence on nicotine, which is a highly addictive substance that can be hard to quit21. Smoking can also expose teenagers to secondhand smoke, which can cause similar health problems as smoking itself3. Therefore, it is important to prevent teenage smoking and help teenagers who smoke to quit as soon as possible. Some ways to do this are:  Educating teenagers about the harmful effects of smoking and the benefits of quitting Providing support and counseling for teenagers who want to quit smoking Enforcing laws that prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors Restricting the advertising and promotion of tobacco products  ",0
" I can help you with generating an essay on a public health concern. Here is a possible introduction:  Public health is the science and practice of protecting and improving the health of populations through prevention, promotion, and policy. Public health aims to address the social, environmental, and economic determinants of health that affect individuals and communities. Public health also responds to emerging and re-emerging health threats, such as infectious diseases, natural disasters, and bioterrorism. However, public health faces many challenges and opportunities in the 21st century, as the world becomes more interconnected, diverse, and complex. In this essay, I will discuss one of the public health concerns that I believe is serious enough to warrant immediate attention: food insecurity1.  Food insecurity is defined as the lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 800 million people in the world suffer from chronic hunger, and more than 2 billion people experience moderate or severe food insecurity. Food insecurity can have negative impacts on physical and mental health, such as malnutrition, stunting, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. Food insecurity can also contribute to social and political instability, violence, and conflict. Food insecurity is influenced by multiple factors, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, population growth, urbanization, migration, trade policies, food waste, and food systems. Therefore, addressing food insecurity requires a comprehensive and multisectoral approach that involves collaboration among governments, civil society, private sector, academia, and international organizations.

" Here is a possible essay on a major environmental problem and what I believe should be done about it.  One of the biggest environmental problems of our time is climate change, which is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes. Climate change is affecting every aspect of life on Earth, from ecosystems and biodiversity to human health and well-being. It is also exacerbating other environmental problems such as water scarcity, soil erosion, pollution, and food waste.  Climate change is a global challenge that requires collective action and cooperation from all countries, sectors, and individuals. There is no single solution to this problem, but rather a combination of mitigation and adaptation strategies that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change. Some of the possible solutions include:  Switching to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power, which do not emit greenhouse gases and can provide clean and affordable energy for all. Implementing carbon pricing mechanisms such as taxes or cap-and-trade systems, which can create incentives for reducing emissions and investing in low-carbon technologies and practices. Promoting energy efficiency and conservation in buildings, transportation, industry, and households, which can save money and reduce energy demand and emissions. Restoring and protecting natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, grasslands, and oceans, which can store carbon, provide habitat for wildlife, regulate water cycles, and offer other ecosystem services. Adopting sustainable agriculture and land use practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, crop rotation, and soil management, which can enhance soil fertility, biodiversity, food security, and carbon sequestration. Reducing food waste and loss along the supply chain from production to consumption, which can save resources, money, and emissions. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), about one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted or lost every year1. Supporting climate adaptation and resilience measures such as early warning systems, disaster risk reduction, social protection, climate-smart infrastructure, and community-based initiatives, which can help vulnerable people and regions cope with the effects of climate change such as droughts, floods, heatwaves, storms, sea level rise, and diseases. Climate change is a serious threat to the environment and humanity that cannot be ignored or delayed. It requires urgent action from everyone at every level. By implementing these solutions and others that are appropriate for different contexts and needs, we can mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts while also achieving other social, economic, and environmental benefits.

" Fame and fortune are often seen as desirable goals in our society, but they can also have significant impacts on a person’s life. Some of these impacts may be positive, such as recognition, wealth, influence, and opportunities. However, some of them may be negative, such as isolation, mistrust, loss of privacy, stress, addiction, and identity crisis.  According to some psychological studies12, fame can change a person’s sense of self and their relationship with the world. Some celebrities may develop a split between their “authentic self” and their “celebrity self”, as a way of coping with the demands and expectations of fame. They may also feel like they are living in a bubble, a cage, or a fishbowl, where they are constantly watched, judged, and invaded by others. They may lose touch with their roots, their values, and their true friends. They may also become addicted to fame itself, as a way of filling a void or escaping from their problems.  Fame can also affect a person’s fortune, both positively and negatively. On one hand, fame can bring financial rewards, material comforts, and access to resources and privileges. On the other hand, fame can also bring financial risks, such as overspending, lawsuits, taxes, and frauds. Fame can also make a person more vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and betrayal by others who want to profit from their fame or harm their reputation.  Therefore, fame and fortune can change a person’s life in many ways, both good and bad. The way a person deals with these changes depends on their personality, their values, their support system, and their coping skills. Some celebrities may be able to handle fame and fortune with grace, humility, and responsibility. Others may struggle with fame and fortune and succumb to its negative effects. Fame and fortune are not inherently good or bad; they are what we make of them. ",0
" Conveniences are things that make our lives easier, more comfortable, or more enjoyable. They can be products, services, technologies, or practices that save us time, effort, money, or hassle. Conveniences have changed people's lives in many ways, both positive and negative. In this essay, I will discuss some of the impacts of conveniences on different aspects of human life, such as media, health, education, and social relationships.  One of the most obvious ways that conveniences have changed people's lives is through media and media consumption. Thanks to the internet, smartphones, streaming platforms, and social media, we have access to a vast amount of information and entertainment at our fingertips. We can watch movies and shows on demand, listen to music and podcasts, read books and articles, play games, and communicate with anyone around the world. According to the World Economic Forum[^1^][1], technology has radically transformed our societies and our daily lives since the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Technology has also enabled new forms of media production and distribution, such as blogs, podcasts, YouTube videos, and online platforms for journalism and activism. These conveniences have given us more choices, opportunities, and empowerment as media consumers and producers.  However, conveniences also have some drawbacks when it comes to media and media consumption. For example, some people may become addicted to their devices and spend too much time online, neglecting their physical and mental health, their work or studies, and their social interactions. Some people may also become overwhelmed by the amount of information and entertainment available online and suffer from information overload or decision fatigue. Moreover, some people may be exposed to misinformation, propaganda, hate speech, cyberbullying, or other harmful content online that can affect their beliefs, attitudes, emotions, or behaviors. Additionally, some people may lose their critical thinking skills or their sense of reality when they rely too much on online sources or platforms for their information and opinions.  Another way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through health and healthcare. Thanks to advances in medicine, biotechnology, engineering, and artificial intelligence, we have access to better diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure of various diseases and conditions. We can also monitor our health using wearable devices or apps that track our vital signs, activity levels, sleep patterns, or nutrition. We can also order medicines or consult doctors online using telemedicine services. According to KARK[^2^][2], a life of convenience has allowed many people to enjoy longer and healthier lives.  However, conveniences also have some negative impacts on health and healthcare. For instance, some people may become lazy or sedentary when they rely too much on technology or services for their daily tasks or needs. Some people may also develop unhealthy habits or lifestyles when they consume too much fast food, processed food, alcohol, or drugs that are easily available or delivered to their doorsteps. Some people may also lose their natural immunity or resistance to diseases when they overuse antibiotics, vaccines, or supplements that are meant to protect them from infections or illnesses. Furthermore, some people may face ethical, legal, or social dilemmas when they use technologies or services that alter their genes, organs, or appearance for cosmetic, enhancement, or reproductive purposes.  A third way that conveniences have changed people's lives is through education and learning. Thanks to the internet, computers, tablets, and online platforms, we have access to a wide range of educational resources and opportunities at any time and place. We can learn new skills, languages, or subjects using online courses, tutorials, or videos. We can also obtain degrees or certificates from reputable institutions using online programs or platforms. According to Shauna Hart[^2^][2], a mother of three adult children who completed a degree online, technology has opened a lot more doors for education and learning that would not have been possible otherwise.  However, conveniences also have some challenges when it comes to education and learning. For example, some people may lack the motivation, discipline, or self-regulation skills to complete their online courses or programs successfully. Some people may also cheat or plagiarize when they use online sources or tools for their assignments or exams. Moreover, some people may miss out on the social, emotional, or cultural aspects of education and learning when they study online without interacting with their teachers or peers face-to-face. Additionally, some people may face difficulties in finding jobs or recognition when they use online degrees or certificates that are not accredited or accepted by employers or institutions. ",0
" Teaching is a noble and challenging profession that requires constant learning and improvement. Teachers have a significant impact on their students’ lives and academic success, so they need to use effective methods and strategies to facilitate learning and engagement. In this essay, I will describe some of the techniques or methods that could help teachers do their job more effectively.  One of the techniques that teachers can use is online learning. Online learning is the process of educating others using the internet, whether that’s through video calls, webinars, or messaging platforms1. Online learning can be beneficial for both teachers and students, as it offers flexibility, accessibility, and variety. Teachers can create digital resources for their students, such as presentations, videos, or worksheets, and use different tools and platforms to deliver them. Students can access these resources at their own pace and convenience, and interact with their teachers and peers through online forums or chats. Online learning can also help teachers reach more students who may not be able to attend school due to various reasons1.  Another technique that teachers can use is experiential learning. Experiential learning is the idea that learning is a product of direct experience rather than passive observation2. Experiential learning can help students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills, as well as learn from their mistakes and reflect on their actions2. Teachers can use experiential learning methods such as experiments, simulations, games, field trips, or projects to engage students in active learning and connect theory to practice. Experiential learning can be effective for several subjects, especially during science experiments, sports coaching, and group projects1.  A third technique that teachers can use is gamification. Gamification is the application of game elements and principles to non-game contexts, such as education3. Gamification can help teachers make learning more fun and motivating for students by using rewards, challenges, feedback, and competition. Teachers can use gamification techniques such as quizzes, badges, leaderboards, or points to enhance student participation and retention. Gamification can also help teachers differentiate instruction and assessment according to the needs and preferences of different students3.  In conclusion, teaching is a complex and dynamic process that requires effective methods and techniques to achieve optimal results. Some of the techniques that teachers can use are online learning, experiential learning, and gamification. These techniques can help teachers create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for their students and support their academic achievements.   ",0

" One team sport that interests me is basketball. Basketball is a fast-paced game that involves two teams of five players each, who try to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop at either end of the court. The game requires skill, teamwork, strategy, and endurance.  Basketball was invented in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian-American physical education teacher who wanted to create a sport that could be played indoors during the winter. He used peach baskets as the goals and a soccer ball as the ball. The original rules had 13 items and did not include dribbling or fouls1.  Basketball has become one of the most popular and widely played sports in the world, with millions of fans and players of all ages and levels. The sport has also evolved over time, with new rules, equipment, techniques, and styles of play. Some of the most famous basketball players include Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O’Neal.  Basketball is a sport that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their height, gender, or background. It can be played for fun, exercise, or competition. It can also teach valuable lessons about teamwork, discipline, respect, and sportsmanship. Basketball is a sport that challenges both the body and the mind. ",0
" An adjective is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun123. It can provide more information about the qualities, number, or identity of the noun or pronoun1. For example, in the sentence “She is a kind person”, the word “kind” is an adjective that describes the noun “person”.  To explain why a particular adjective describes me perfectly, I would need to choose an adjective that reflects my personality, appearance, skills, or values. Then I would need to give specific examples of how that adjective applies to me and how it distinguishes me from others. For instance, if I choose the adjective “creative”, I could write something like this:  Creative is an adjective that describes me perfectly because I enjoy using my imagination and originality to produce something new or different. I am creative in various aspects of my life, such as writing, drawing, cooking, and solving problems. For example, I like to write poems and stories that express my feelings and ideas in a unique way. I also like to draw cartoons and illustrations that make people laugh or think. When I cook, I experiment with different ingredients and flavors to create delicious dishes. And when I face a challenge, I try to find innovative solutions that work for me and others. Being creative helps me to express myself, have fun, learn new things, and overcome difficulties. It also makes me different from other people who may not share my interests or talents. Therefore, creative is an adjective that perfectly describes who I am and what I do.   ",0
" Cooperation is the act or situation of working or acting together for a common benefit or goal1. It can involve association, joint effort, or assistance from persons or organizations12. It can also be a combination of persons for purposes of production, purchase, or distribution1. Cooperation can be helpful, wanted, or effective1.  To me, cooperation means being willing to cooperate with others, respecting their opinions and perspectives, and contributing to the shared outcome. It means being open-minded, flexible, and supportive of others’ ideas and efforts. It also means being accountable for my own actions and responsibilities, and accepting feedback and criticism.  Cooperation is important for many reasons. First, it can help achieve goals that are too complex or difficult for one person or group to accomplish alone. For example, cooperation can enable scientific discoveries, technological innovations, artistic creations, and social movements that require collaboration and coordination among different disciplines, sectors, or countries. Second, cooperation can foster positive relationships and trust among people who have different backgrounds, beliefs, or interests. For example, cooperation can promote mutual understanding, tolerance, and respect among people who have different cultures, religions, or political views. Third, cooperation can enhance personal growth and development by exposing oneself to new perspectives, experiences, and challenges. For example, cooperation can stimulate learning, creativity, problem-solving, and communication skills that are essential for personal and professional success.  In conclusion, cooperation is a valuable skill and attitude that can benefit oneself and others in various ways. It can help achieve common goals, build positive relationships, and enhance personal growth. Cooperation is not always easy or natural, but it is worth practicing and improving because it can make a difference in the world.  ",0
" Diversity is a term that has many meanings and applications in different contexts. In general, diversity refers to the condition, fact, or quality of being different, varied, or composed of many different elements or types1. Diversity can be seen in various aspects of human life, such as culture, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, religion, age, ability, and more. Diversity can also be applied to other domains, such as biology, ecology, politics, education, and art.  Diversity is important for several reasons. First, diversity reflects the reality of the world we live in, where people have different backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and identities. Recognizing and respecting diversity can help us to understand and appreciate the richness and complexity of human society. Second, diversity can foster creativity, innovation, and problem-solving by bringing together different ideas and approaches. Diversity can also challenge stereotypes and prejudices and promote critical thinking and dialogue. Third, diversity can enhance social justice and equity by ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities and access to resources and rights. Diversity can also empower marginalized groups and amplify their voices and contributions.  However, diversity also poses some challenges and conflicts. Diversity can sometimes create misunderstandings, tensions, and divisions among people who have different views or interests. Diversity can also be threatened by discrimination, oppression, or violence that aim to exclude or harm certain groups or individuals. Diversity can also be misused or exploited for political or economic purposes that do not benefit the common good.  Therefore, diversity requires awareness, education, and action to be valued and protected. Diversity requires us to recognize and respect the differences among us without denying our common humanity. Diversity requires us to celebrate and learn from the variety of cultures and experiences that enrich our lives. Diversity requires us to work together to overcome the barriers and challenges that prevent us from achieving a more inclusive and harmonious society.  In conclusion, diversity is a multifaceted concept that has many implications for human life. Diversity is both a source of strength and a challenge for our society.

" There are several reasons why some people may be afraid of sharks. Here are a few:  Media portrayal: Sharks are often depicted in movies and the media as vicious and ruthless predators. These images can create fear and anxiety in people, especially those who have little direct experience with sharks.  Lack of familiarity: Many people have never been in the ocean or have never seen a shark up close. This lack of familiarity with the animal can make it seem mysterious and dangerous.  Personal experiences: Some people may have had negative experiences with sharks, such as being bitten or attacked. Even if these incidents are rare, they can create a lasting fear of the animal.  Evolutionary response: It's possible that our fear of sharks is partly a result of evolution. Our ancestors may have learned to fear large, predatory animals as a survival mechanism, and this fear has been passed down through generations.  Overall, while some fear of sharks may be rational, it's important to remember that they are not usually a threat to humans and that the vast majority of shark encounters end without incident.

" If computers never existed, modern life would be drastically different in numerous ways. Here are some examples:  Communication: Without computers, our communication methods would be limited to traditional means such as snail mail, telephones, and in-person conversations. Social media, email, video conferencing, and other forms of digital communication would not be possible. This would make it more difficult to connect with people who are far away and to work collaboratively with people in other parts of the world.  Information access: The internet, as we know it today, would not exist without computers. This means that we would have limited access to information and knowledge. Libraries would still exist, but they would be the primary source of information, and people would have to spend more time searching for the information they need.  Work and productivity: Computers have revolutionized the way we work and increased our productivity. Without them, many jobs that require computer skills would not exist, and others would require much more time and effort. For example, accounting and bookkeeping would require manual calculations, and writing and editing would require typewriters and handwritten drafts.  Entertainment: Computers have also transformed the way we entertain ourselves. Streaming services, video games, and social media are all computer-based forms of entertainment that would not exist without computers. People would have to rely on traditional forms of entertainment such as books, TV, and movies.  Transportation: Computers play a vital role in transportation, from designing vehicles to managing traffic flow. Without them, transportation would be less efficient and more dangerous. Air travel would also be impacted as computers are essential for navigation and communication between pilots and air traffic control.  In summary, without computers, modern life would be vastly different. We would have to rely on traditional methods of communication and information access, and many of the jobs, entertainment options, and transportation systems we have today would not exist.        ",0

If you prefer a more relaxed lifestyle, a cat or a small animal like a hamster or a rabbit may be a better fit.  Research different breeds or species: Different breeds of dogs or species of animals have different personality traits, energy levels, and care requirements. Take the time to research different options and choose a pet that matches your lifestyle.  Visit a shelter or rescue organization: Consider adopting a pet from a shelter or rescue organization. The staff can help match you with a pet that will fit your lifestyle and provide information about the pet's personality and needs.  By following these steps, you can choose a pet that will be a good match for your lifestyle and provide you with years of companionship and joy.     ",0

Remove any electrical plates, light fixtures or cover with painter’s tape.  Clean the walls: Use a damp cloth to clean the walls and remove any dirt, dust, or grime.

Draping over everything like a shroud,
A weight upon the heart it lays,

As we struggle to come to comprehend,
Why life can be so harsh and cruel,
Leaving us feeling like such a fool. 

Memories flood back without refrain,
Pangs of regret felt once again,
Wishing things could have been different,
But we can't escape the present. 

Like a shadow, sorrow follows us,
A constant undercurrent that rushes,
Through our veins, and in our mind,
A constant reminder of what we left behind. 

But sorrow is not meant to last,
Nor is it a punishment cast,
A lesson to be learned and endured,
So we can get up and be assured. 

Take comfort in the fact that, eventually,
Sorrow will give way to possibility,
A renewed spirit and a new hope,
As we climb up from the abyss, we cope.

A chilling wind that sweeps us past
To fall into a deep abyss
And be consumed by endless wisps

A phantom that cannot be fought
A voice that whispers in our ear
Promising nothing but despair

We turn away and try to flee
But fear is always there to see
A constant presence, never gone
A reminder that we are not strong

It drags us down, it weighs us low
A burden we cannot overthrow
But still, we try to persevere
Knowing that fear will always be near

Yet in the end, we must concede
That fear is just a part of need
A primal instinct, deep inside
A force that makes us stay alive

So let us not be overawed
By fear’s relentless, endless claw

A strength that keeps us one step behind.",0

A raging tempest I cannot hide
It swells within my heart and mind
And leaves my soul in binds

Anger fumes and consumes
Tearing down all that blooms
It burns and sears like fire
A destructive force, a dire

Anger gnaws and claws
Leaving me with gaping flaws
It steals my peace and joy
And leaves me feeling like a toy

But in anger, there is power
A force to break down walls and towers
To fight for what is right
And to shine a path through the darkest night

Anger is both curse and blessing
With a potential for both destruction and progressing
May I learn to channel it well
And let my anger lead me out of hell.",0

"In midst of chaos, we wage a war,
A battle long, with no end in sight,
With tears and blood, we search for more,
To conquer lands, and claim the right.

The sound of guns, echoes loud,
As missiles fly, through the sky,
The earth trembles, beneath the crowd,
As we speak of peace, with a sigh.

For every life, we take with pride,
A thousand more, will rise in scorn,
And in this cycle, we cannot hide,
As we continue, to be reborn.

The screams of agony, we hear,
As we watch, our brothers fall,
And in this darkness, we fear,
That we may never end it all.

For war is not a game we play,
It's a tragedy, we cannot deny,
And in the end, we always pay,
As we stand alone, wondering why.

And end this violence, once and for all,

With every step we learn and we know.

Life gives us moments of purest bliss,
When love and laughter are hard to miss,
But it also deals us its heavy blow,
With pain and sorrow we must learn to grow.

We face challenges that test our might,
And push us to stand up and fight,
To find our strength and courage within,
And know that we'll come out to win.

The beauty of life lies in its sway,
With each breath a new beginning, a new day,
In every moment, a chance to start anew,
And embrace the wonders that life offers you.

Chase your dreams and let your heart feel,

"Death, the great equalizer
No matter your wealth or class
All must succumb to its power
As we take our final breath

Silently stealing our life away
Leaving behind shattered hearts
As we mourn our loved ones' fate

Some see death as the end 
A dark abyss we cannot comprehend 
But for others, it's a new beginning
A journey to another realm, unending

Death may be inevitable 
But it need not be feared 
For in its wake, we find solace
In memories of those who disappeared 

We honor the dead by living 
By cherishing the moments we create

But the love we share abides and remains great 

So when we face our own mortality 
May we meet it with grace and dignity 
For death may be certain
But how we choose to live is entirely up to our own creativity.",0

Yesterday, it's just a memory,
And tomorrow, it's yet to come,
Today is all we ever see,
Our present moment, a precious sum.

From birth until the day we die,
Time ticks away, never to stop,

"Up high in the sky, so free,
Floats a fluffy white cloud, you see,
Drifting and dancing with ease,
Sunbeams illuminating its tease.

A wisp of vapor, ever-changing,
Shape-shifting as the wind's arranging,
From delicate whiteness to gray,
Its mood and color can sway.

Sometimes it's puffy and round,
Other times it's stretched on the ground,
Silver linings and shadows greet,
A heavenly view of nature's feat.

In summer, it provides a shade,
A respite from the sun's harsh blade,
In winter, it hides the stars,
A soft blanket for our planet's scars.

Cloud, oh how you make my heart sing,
A symbol of imagination's wing,
A muse for dreams and fantasies,
A bridge to the heavens, and all its entities.",0

As branches bow beneath snow's weighty part.
The world is coated in a pristine white,
A blanket of snow brings a wondrous sight.

Children laugh and play, bundled up tight,
Their joy infectious, hearts alight.
Snowmen emerging, built with care,
Truly a scene, enchantingly rare.

Frosty breaths, crystalized in air,
Footprints left behind without a care.
A winter wonderland transforms the land,
Beauty found in places so grand.

As snow continues to gently fall,
A calmness comes, enveloping all.
An unearthly peace, serene and still,
As winter's snow blankets every hill.

Effortlessly settling, ready to stay.
Magical white, a sight to behold,
As snow's arrival, brings happiness untold.",0

But the journey we take, and the adventures at hand.",0

The wonders and the mistakes
Of history, for it is a guide
To a brighter tomorrow, where we thrive.",0

the words that cast the spell,
the mystical touch of the hand,
the jump of heart that can tell.

The dark caves and the lonely towers,
the promise of the new hope,
the ancient rites and the forgotten powers,
which in the myths of old would cope.

The whisper of the ancient woods,
the dance of the fairies bright,
the mystery of the hidden goods,
that only the chosen ones can sight.

The breaking of the spells of sadness,
the joy of the lit up faces,
the hope that shines in the gladness,

"The villain lurks in shadows deep,
A creature born to scheme and creep.
His heart is black as coal and tar,
And evil thoughts have left their scar.

He revels in his wicked game,
Taking pleasure in causing pain.
He cares not for the woes he sows,
In his heart, only darkness grows.

His twisted mind seeks to destroy,
The light of any hope or joy.
He revels in the misery he wrought,
Infernal flames are all he's got.

No one dares to face his wrath,
For the villain walks the devil's path.
His deeds are known, his name reviled,
His presence leaves us cold and chilled.

A bittersweet symphony, constantly inviting.
It's the gentle touch, and the tender kiss,
The promise of forever, that we cannot dismiss.

Love is a dance, with steps so intricate,
The beats of our hearts, so passionate and deliberate.
It's the beating of drums, the rhythm of life,
The melody that we feel, in the stillness of night.

Love is a combination, of joy and of pain,
A whisper of comfort, in times of disdain.
It's the laughter and tears, the high and the low,
The bond that never breaks, no matter how much we grow.

Love is a feeling that we cannot ignore,
The sweetest of all, the most precious of all.
It's the reason we were created, to feel and to give,
For it is true that with love, we truly can live.",0
"Hate is a flame that burns so bright,
A poison that eats at the soul like a blight.
It twists and turns in a wicked dance,
And leaves destruction in its every chance.

It grows and festers deep within,
An endless pit of anger and sin.
It thrives on pain and suffering,
And leaves behind a world so utterly suffocating.

It blinds us to the beauty that surrounds,
A darkness that envelopes and astounds.
It feeds on envy, greed, and jealousy,
And leaves behind a trail of misery.

Hate is a weapon we wield with ease,
A tool of destruction that no one can appease.
It drives us to do unspeakable things,
And leaves behind a trail of ruin and bling.

So let us reject this terrible fate,
And strive instead for love and not hate.
Let us celebrate difference and diversity,
And live in harmony with peace and prosperity.",0

The will to fight against all odds,
To conquer the darkness and beat the gods.

And triumph over the challenges of life!",0
"Wisdom can be found in many things,
In the air we breathe, in the songs we sing,
In the depths of the ocean, in the heights of the sky,
In the silence of the forest, in the loudness of a cry.

Wisdom is not something one can acquire,
It is not something to buy, to own or to admire,
It is a gentle voice that speaks from within,
It is a light that guides us through thick and thin.

Wisdom is the gift of the ages,
Of the sages and the philosophers and the wise,
It is the art of living the human life,
With compassion, love, and eternal ties.

Wisdom is the grace that comes with time,
The fruit of experience, the wine of the divine,
It is the power to see beyond what's seen,
To find beauty in the ugly, and meaning in the mean.

So, seek for wisdom with an open heart,
And listen to the whispers of your inner part,
For in its depth, you'll find the key,
To unlock the doors of eternity.",0
"Beauty, oh beauty, you are fleeting and rare,
A sight to behold, a bliss beyond compare.
The gentle curves of a rose, the sun setting at dawn,
The fluttering butterfly wings, the white of a swan.

The way the wind dances through the leaves,
Or the pattern of the snowflake, as it grieves,
For it knows its beauty, yet it melts away,
Just like the sun, come the end of day.

Oh, but beauty, you are not just skin deep,
It's the spark in the eyes, the smile that's so sweet,
The kindness in the heart, the laughter that's true,
These traits that make beauty, not just what we view.

Beauty is in the spirit, the soul within,
In the way one talks, acts, and where they have been.
True beauty radiates from the inside out,
And for that, my dear, there's no amount of doubt.

So cherish the beauty that surrounds us each day,
Take a step back, and in awe, we can say,
That in every corner, in big things and small,
Beauty abounds, and it touches us all.",0
"Ugliness, oh how unkind,
A mark upon the face and mind.
A label we give to those we see,
A weight to bear, an identity.

But who decides what is beauty?
A societal norm, a fleeting duty.
Is it not in the eye of the beholder?
A subjective view, a personal folder.

For what is deemed grotesque to one,
May be a masterpiece to some.
An imperfect flower, a broken vase,
Can still hold beauty in its embrace.

So let us not be quick to judge,
Or turn away with a cold, hard nudge.
For ugliness may just be a facade,
And beneath it lies a beauty, flawed.

Let us see with eyes anew,
And find the beauty, pure and true.
For in the world there is much to behold,
Even in the ugliness, a story untold.",0

Through the darkness and the strife
It shines bright and pure within us

Truth is the foundation of our being
The anchor of our soul
The source of all that we believe in
And the goal that makes us whole

It is the wisdom that we seek
In every thought and deed
And in its shining brilliance
We find the answers that we need

So let us hold fast to truth always
And let it be our guide
For it is the greatest gift of all
That in our hearts resides.",0
"A Lie's Lullaby

Oh sweet deceit, how softly you sing,
A lullaby of falsehood that fools bring.
You whisper sweet nothings, a lover's embrace,
Yet your words are empty, you leave no trace.

You spin a web of falsehoods galore,
Leaving chaos and destruction at your door.
With every fib and every ploy,
You slowly strip us of our joy.

A world of lies, a universe of deceit,
A place where truth cannot compete.
You mask the truth with a twisted smile,
And leave us trapped in a world of denial.

But in the end, the truth will prevail,
And your deceitful song will ultimately fail.
For honesty is the only way,
To live a life that's pure and gay.

So sleep well, oh cunning liar,
For the truth shall never tire.
And one day, you'll have to pay,
For the lies you spun along the way.",0
"Faith is like a light that guides our way,
A pillar strong that helps us stay.
When the road is dark and bleak,
It is faith that we must seek.

It's the belief in something bigger,
Something that makes our heart trigger.

Over the mountains, standing high.

Faith is the wind beneath our wings,
The trust that makes us believe in things.
Hope in the midst of despair,
The promise of a better air.

It's the deepest part of our soul,
The mark that makes us whole.
A connection to the divine,
A power that makes us shine.

Faith is what keeps us going,
A light that keeps on glowing.
It's the spark that sets us free,

"Doubt creeps in like a thief in the night,
Stealing the solid ground under my feet.
It wraps around my heart with all its might,
Whispering lies and planting deceit.

Uncertainty floods my mind and soul,
A torrent of anxiety and fear.
It rends the fabric of my being whole,
And leaves me feeling lost and unclear.

I question every thought and every choice,
Second-guessing even my own voice.
Is this the path I'm meant to take?
Or have I made a grave mistake?

Oh, doubt, you are a cruel and cunning foe,
A relentless adversary to my peace.
But though you try to overthrow,
I refuse to let you have the final say, cease!

For I know deep within my core,
That doubt is just a passing storm.
And though it may shake me to the core,
I will rise again, reborn.",0
"Freedom, oh Freedom!

The sweetest sound to hear,
The joyous feeling so dear.
To roam far and wide,
Without any bounds to abide.

Freedom to breathe the air,
And be not scared to dare.
To live life on our terms,
And not be held by any norms.

Freedom to chase our dreams,
And be what we want to seem.
To shine bright like a star,
And never be held behind bars.

Freedom from hate and pain,
And to see the rainbow after the rain.
To live in harmony with all,

Freedom, oh freedom,
The treasure we seek each day,
To live in peace and love,

"Memories are like little fragments in time
That we store away in the corners of our mind,
Tiny bits of joy, love and pain alike,
Etched deeply in the depths of our psyche.

Some memories are sweet, like a summer day,
Filled with laughter, joy and love that came our way,
We cherish them close and cling to them tight,
As we journey through life, both day and night.

Others are bitter, like a winter's storm,
Memories of hurt, loss and thoughts forlorn,
We try to forget, but they linger on,
Haunting us like a ghost from whence they come.

Memories are like a puzzle in our minds,
Each piece a moment, a story or a sign,
They form a tapestry of our past lives,
And shape the person we become in time.

So, hold on tight to those memories dear,
The ones that bring you hope, love and cheer,
For they are the treasures that we store,
As we journey through life, a little more.",0

A canvas to paint with words and dreams,
A place where limits become torn,
And the impossible becomes supreme.

In this magical place, anything can exist,

Warm hugs and lullabies,
Magical tales before bedtime,
Visions of fairies and dragons to find.

Laughter that echoes, memories that last,
Innocent moments that go by so fast,
A time of wonder, joy, and play,
Childhood, where our hearts can truly stay.",0
"As days go by and years unfold,
The whispers of time so loudly told.
The body moves a little slower,
The mind sometimes a little lower.

Once a youthful spirit shone so bright,
But now it's dimmed by time's long flight.
Memories of yesteryear still remain,
Like embers in a fire that still contain.

The wrinkles on the face now show,
The love, the laughter, the joy and woe.
A life well-lived, tis' plain to see,
A tale of happiness and mystery.

The eyes once bright now see the past,
They watched the world's growth and contrast.
The hands that once held life's sweet fruits,
Now cherish moments that time disputes.

Each day anew, a blessing in sight,
A marking of time, a graceful flight.
Aging is not to be feared or shunned,

We gain wisdom and inner length.

"Change is an elusive wave
It haunts, it inspires, it saves
It carries us through a sea of time
And leads us to worlds, both sublime and divine

Change is the wind that shifts our sails
It whispers, it pulls, it propels

And opens up new horizons and doors

Change is the flame that ignites our souls
It burns, it transforms, it controls
It reveals our strengths and weaknesses alike
And sets us on a path towards our true self-like

"Growth is not always easy,
It can be painful and hard,
But as we reach towards the sky,
We become who we're meant to be.

From a small seed in the earth,
To a mighty tree in the sky,
We grow and change with the world,
And learn to spread our wings and fly.

There are challenges along the way,
Moments when we stumble and fall,
But with each step we take,
We become stronger and stand tall.

As we grow, we learn to see,
The beauty in the ups and downs,
And we find joy in the journey,
As we reach higher ground.

So let us keep on growing,
In all that we do and say,

We become wiser and more brave.",0
"Learning is an adventure, a journey we all take,
A path to enlightenment, that opens with each step we make.

We start as curious children, eager to explore,

But perseverance and determination, can fill our minds with hope.

Learning is a lifelong process, a gift we should embrace,
It enriches our lives and helps us find our rightful place.

"Teaching is an art so true,
A passion to impart what's new,
A journey for both me and you,
A gift that comes from the heart so true.

In the beginning it may seem tough,
As students struggle with concepts rough,
But patience is key, and soon enough,
They'll grasp the lesson, and impress us with their stuff.

As a teacher, I strive to ignite,
A love of learning and a thirst to fight,
To find the answers, and soar in flight,
To think for themselves, and emerge in light.

A classroom is where we all come together,
To share ideas and learn how to weather,
Life's challenges, and find what we treasure,
To build a future of joy and pleasure.

I'm proud to have a role in this,
To guide, inspire, and watch them bliss,
As they grow up, and fulfill their wish,
To shine, to lead, to chase what they miss.

Teaching is an adventure every day,
A chance to make a difference, in a unique way,
I'm grateful, thankful, and blessed to say,
That teaching is my calling, come what may.",0

"Pain, oh pain, you invisible foe
Creeping up on me, oh so slow
You grip my heart, you grip my soul
And leave me feeling far from whole

You seep into my bones and flesh
Leaving me feeling like a mess
An ache that never seems to end
A wound that never quite can mend

But through it all, I stand upright
Leaning on strength, with all my might
For pain may shake me, but not break me
It may hurt me, but it can't take me

For I am more than just this pain 
I am not just my ache and strain
I am a fighter, always strong
Braving the storms, all day long

"Sadness is a heavy cloak
That drapes upon my soul
It smothers me with every breath
And leaves me feeling whole

Its weight is palpable
A burden to my heart
Bringing tears that overflow
And rip my world apart

It lingers like a storm cloud
That never seems to clear
Casting shadows on my days
And filling me with fear

It leaves me feeling empty
And hollow deep inside
A constant ache that never fades
No matter how I try

But still I hold on tightly
To the hope I have within
For even in the darkest times
A ray of light can win

For though the sadness may endure
And try to bring me down
I know that deep within my heart
Hope can always be found.",0

Uniting us in a single call

And share this gift with every woman and man

A blessing that will forever shine.",0
"Tears, oh tears, precious drops of pain,
Expressing emotions too difficult to contain,
They fall down our face, like a gentle rain,
A release for our heart, a comfort for our brain.

They come in moments of sorrow and grief,
In moments of joy, pure and brief,
They roll down our cheeks, with utmost belief,
An outlet for the soul, an escape for the thief.

Sometimes we cry, without a reason or why,
Sometimes we let go, without even trying to pry,
Tears, oh tears, they make us feel alive,
Invisible yet visible, they help us thrive.

They speak of our struggles, of our defeat,
Of the battles fought, of the wars we meet,
They tell tales of love, of longing and regret,
Of things we hope for, but can never truly get.

Tears, oh tears, they hold the truth,
Of our deepest desires, of our lost youth,
They bring healing, they bring the proof,
That life is not perfect, but still, it's worth the pursuit.

So let them fall, let them flow,
Let them cleanse your heart, and help you grow,

Away from the noise and the hustle.
You envelop me in your embrace,
A comforting balm for my soul's muscle.

In your serenity, I find beauty,
In the subtle whispers of the wind.
The rustle of leaves, the flutter of a butterfly,
In the depths of your silence, I find.

How deafening your quietness can be,
Like a void, an unspoken language,
But in its barrenness, lies a mystery,
A place for reflection and self-challenge.

Silence, how you speak so much,
In the moment between words,
An expansive universe to touch,
A canvas for profound records.

Oh, sweet silence, how I love thee,
For in your stillness, I find myself free.",0
"Noise, the cacophony of life
It surrounds us, envelops us
Like a blanket of sound that never ends
Honking cars, blaring music, and buzzing crowds

Noise is the drumbeat of our days
The rhythm of the city, the beat of our hearts
It is the symphony of life in motion
The orchestra of chaos and order

Sometimes noise can be comforting
The sound of rain on a rooftop
Or the laughter of children at play
It is the soundtrack of our world, the pulse of our existence

Yet, even in the midst of noise
We long for the silence
The stillness that calms the soul
The moment of peace amid the chaos

So let us revel in the noise
But also seek the quiet moments
For in the balance of the two
We find the harmony of life.",0
"In the world of harmony, there's a beautiful beat
A rhythm that moves our hearts and takes us off our feet
It's a melody that brings us together
And makes us feel like one, forever

When music plays, we forget all our troubles
And the harmony in our souls, suddenly doubles
In the perfect notes and smooth sounds we treasure
Our hearts drift away and find hidden pleasure

Whether it's an acapella or a symphony
The harmony flows and sets us all free
The lyrics may differ but the tune is the same
It's unity that is brought in the name of the game

In nature, harmony can be found
Each element working together and resound
The ocean waves and the gentle breeze
Or the chirping of the birds up in the trees

Harmony is peace and balance
A state of being, a dance
A connection that we all share
Together, we create a beautiful air

Let the harmony surround us
And let it be what grounds us
For together we are strong and bright
In harmony, we find the light.",0
"Chaos reigns supreme,  
A thundering storm without respite.  
Wild and untamed,  
It rages on without end in sight.  

In its wake, it leaves behind  
A wasteland of destruction and pain.  
Chaos is not kind,  
Nor does it ever stop to explain.  

It twists and turns,  
Bending reality to its will.  
It consumes all that it churns,  
And nothing can ever be still.  

But within the chaos lies a spark,  
A glimmer of possibility and hope.  
For out of destruction can come a new start,  
A chance for growth and something to cope.  

So let chaos rage on,  
And let it shake us to our core.  
For though it may seem all is gone,  
Out of chaos can come something more.",0
"Balance is the key to happiness, 
A state where we feel at ease, 
Where our bodies and minds are aligned, 
And we're filled with a sense of peace. 

We're like tightrope walkers, 
Walking a delicate line, 
Between extremes of pleasure and pain, 
Trying to find the middle ground. 

We need a balance of work and rest, 
To keep our energy levels high, 
And a healthy balance of food and drink, 
To nourish our bodies and minds. 

Emotional balance is essential too, 
To keep our minds in check, 
And a balance between give and take, 
Ensures our relationships stay in check. 

Life is a balancing act, 
And we need to be mindful and present, 
To keep ourselves centred and focused, 
And free from stress and resentment. 

So let's strive for balance in all we do, 
And find joy and happiness each day, 
For when we're in balance with ourselves and the world, 
We truly feel alive and at play.",0
"In the darkest of nights,
The moon shines bright,
A contrast so stark,
It highlights the plight.

The black and the white,
The high and the low,
The fire and the ice,
The fast and the slow.

Life's full of contrast,
It's what makes us unique,
A blend of the opposites,
Creating the mystique.

The happy and the sad,
The right and the wrong,
The weak and the strong,
The short and the long.

Embrace the contrast,
See the beauty it brings,
For without the darkness,
We cannot cherish the spring.

In the bleakness and light,
Contrast is the key,
For in living the contrast,
We find harmony.",0

The earth's elliptical shape,
The moon's perfectness,
A beauty we can't escape.

Shapes take over.
Sculptures and paintings,
A world to discover.

A language understood.
Its allure and fascination,

An element to define.

"The fragrant scent that fills the air
A smell so sweet, beyond compare
It dances in your nose so fine
And leaves you lost in blissful time

The smell of roses, fresh and bright
Or lavender on a summer's night
The scent of freshly brewed coffee
Softens one's heart and makes us happy

The salty breeze down by the shore
A smell of summer, we adore
Or the beauty of a campfire's smoke
Reminds us of evenings with love and hope

The aroma of baking bread
Takes our souls on a tasty thread

"Sight, oh sight,
What a precious gift besides light.
A stunning world to behold,
A treasure trove of colors and stories untold.

With sight, we witness nature's glory,
The sunrise, the sunset, and all its mystery.
The stars twinkling in the night sky,
And the clouds that paint on high.

Through sight, we can read and learn,
Books and knowledge, to our brain it returns.
We can gaze at art with awe and wonder,
And see the beauty of human culture.

Sight connects us with other souls,
The sparkle in a lover's eye, it unfolds.
The tenderness of a child's smile,
And the happiness that is worth the while.

Without sight, the world would be dark and grey,
Silhouettes of things, apart from the day.
But with sight, we get to live a life,
A precious gift, that helps us thrive.",0
"Sound, oh sound, how sweet thy tune
A melody that fills the room
A symphony of pitch and tone
A journey for the ears alone

A shelter from the elements both good and bad,
Whether the sun shone bright or the sky turned gray,

My dream takes flight and comes to light.
It's a labyrinth of hidden clues,
A journey for my soul to peruse.

At first, I saw a castle grand,
With towers high and walls so grand.
Inside, I felt safe and secure,
Protected by the gates and allure.

Next, a storm began to brew,
And the sky turned a murky hue.
The castle walls began to crumble,
And I felt my peace start to stumble.

But then, a seedling caught my eye,
A tiny plant, so frail and shy.
It grew quickly, reaching for the sun,
Bathing in the light of everyone.

The storm began to fade away,
And with it, my doubts and dismay.
The seedling bloomed into a tree,

"Pretentious Art

Oh, how art loves to be pretentious
With meaning hidden in deep recesses,
A cryptic message only few can perceive
Leaving the rest of us to simply believe.

Wrapped in symbolism and abstraction
Art tries to be more than a mere distraction,
An elevated form of expression and thought,
But to most, it simply seems overwrought.

What happened to art that was accessible,
That spoke to the heart, and soul, and mindable?
When did it become a game for the elite,
An arrogant display of ostentatious conceit?

Perhaps art should remember its true purpose,
To inspire, to uplift, to make life more than surface,
Not to just be a snobbish, high-brow affair
But something that all can appreciate and share.

So let art drop its pretentious façade,
And once again become accessible, not odd,
A thing of beauty that's for everyone to see,
Not just a select few of the bourgeoisie.",0

A bond that will forever transcend.
Through the valleys and the hills,
Our love for each other forever fills.

Loyal as family, our bond we cherish,
Through every up and every perish.
A true friendship so rare,
A bond that all will forever stare.",0
"Locked tight and hidden deep,
A secret I've never shared or spoken.
It's a weight that I forever keep
And a secret that's never awoken.

It weighs on me like a heavy stone
And fills my thoughts with endless plight.
I'm not sure if it's better left alone,
Or if I should bring it to the light.

It's a secret that I can't let go,
One that haunts me day and night.
But the truth is, I never wanted to show
This secret that's hiding in plain sight.

Perhaps one day I'll find the strength
To release it to the open air,
But until then, it stays at length
And silently weighs down my despair.

So if you see me lost in thought,
Lost in a reverie beyond compare,
Know that a secret has been caught
And a burden I still must bear.",0
"Oh, how I long to travel afar

To a place I've always dreamt of afar

A land of stunning beauty and charm

Where the sun illuminates like a vibrant charm

A place where the pristine beaches stretch miles

The sand and the waves blend in with smiles

The palm trees sway to the music of nature

A cool gentle breeze, a feeling of adventure

I want to explore the lush green valleys

To walk in the trails, without any rallies

To hike up the mountain, and witness the grace

Of the sunrise, and the colorful face

To dive in the deep blue ocean

And explore the hidden secrets, with devotion

To watch the dolphins leap and play

A sight that takes my breath away

This place is a magical wonder

A place that makes my heart thunder

I'll visit this place and cherish forever

And my heart will sing, forever and ever.",0
"I admire a person, so kind and true,
Who fills the world with light,
With every step they take, they shine,
A beacon shining bright.

They're selfless in their giving,
A heart as open as the sky,
And with each and every act they do,
They make the world just right.

I marvel at their strength and grace,
Their spirit knows no bounds,
And when the world is at its worst,
They're the ones who turn it round.

So here's to the one I admire,
The soul that lifts me higher,
With every breath they take, they show,
The power of love's fire.",0
"I regret the words I left unsaid,  
The love I held back, the thoughts in my head.  
I wish I had found the courage to speak,  
To let my heart out, to let my soul leak.  

But fear consumed me, the fear of rejection,  
So I kept my distance, stuck to reflection.  
My heart was heavy, with unspoken emotion,  
A burden I carried, a deep-seated notion.  

Now I see the cost of my hesitation,  
The loss of opportunity, the missed sensation.  
I wonder what could have been, what might await,  
If only I had dared to knock on love's gate.  

But time has passed, the door seems closed,  
And I'm left with my regret, my heart exposed.  
I pray that someone else may have the strength I lack,  
To take a chance, to never look back.  

For it's better to try and fail, than to never start,  
To live with regret, with a broken heart.  
So here I stand, a lesson to learn,  
To never let fear hold me back, to let my heart burn.",0
"A moment cherished in my heart so deep,
Comes to me when I'm in my sleep.
A special time, oh so sweet,
A memory that cannot be beat.

A walk along a sandy shore,
With someone special, whom I adore.
The sunset painted orange and red,
And I felt so alive, not dead.

The salty breeze blew in my hair,
As we walked without a care.
Talking, laughing, holding hands,
We walked along the endless sands.

I stopped and turned, took a look,
A memory forever in my book.
The sun was setting, oh so slow,
That moment will forever glow.

The kiss that followed sealed the deal,
A moment that I'll always feel.
My cherished memory, forever mine,
The moment when that sun did shine.",0
"There was a time when I felt so small,
A challenge looming over me like a wall.
I didn't think I could climb up so high,
And I wanted to give up with every try.

But I looked deep down, to my heart,
And found a strength waiting to start.
With each step up, I gained courage and will,
And the weight of the challenge started to thrill.

Every time I reached a new height,
I felt a sense of such pure delight,
And though the climb was tough and steep,
I knew this challenge I could keep.

In the end, I stood tall and proud,
Knowing that I had overcome the clouds,
And as I looked down, what did I see?
A challenge conquered, and the best of me.",0
"The question echoes in my mind,
A riddle I cannot unwind.
It haunts my thoughts both day and night,
As I search for answers without sight.

What lies beyond the great unknown?
A mystery aglow, yet never shown.
Is there a purpose to our lives,
Or do we simply take the ride?

I've pondered long and searched in vain,
For answers that will ease the pain.
But still the question lingers on,
As I wander through life's unknowns.

Perhaps the answer lies within,
A truth we've yet to comprehend.
Or maybe it's a question meant to be,
Forever asked, eternally.

So I'll keep asking, keep exploring,
Knowing I'll never know for sure.
But through the search, I'll find my way,
And maybe find some peace one day.",0
"Once I was seized by fear,
It made my thoughts so unclear,
I trembled at the thought,
Of losing everything I had sought.

It took hold of my mind,
And left no peace to find,
I was afraid of what could be,
Of the unknown, that I could not see.

But one day I decided,
That fear could not have me blinded,
So I took a step forward,
Towards my fear, I began to move toward.

My fear began to lose its grip,
As I took step by step,
I confronted what I once thought,
Was something that could not be fought.

I realized then and there,
That fear was all a dare,
To stay and not move on,
To stay in darkness and not face the sun.

Now fear no longer holds me tight,
In the open, I stand and fight,
And when fears come back to scare,
I am ready, always aware.

For I have conquered my fear,
And it's no longer near,
It no longer makes me quake,
For I have learnt, fear is what we make.",0
"I hope for a world where love prevails,
And people are kind and fair,
Where empathy and compassion never fails,
And every heart is eager to share.

I hope for a future that's full of light,
Where equality reigns supreme,
Where every voice has the right,
To be heard and build their dream.

I hope for a society that's just and true,
Where differences are celebrated,
And every perspective is valued too,
Where human rights are never violated.

I hope for a planet that's green and clean,
And we treat nature with care,
So future generations can glean,
The beauty and wonder that we share.

I hope for a life that's full of joy,
And happiness in each day,
Where friendships and love never destroy,
And laughter is here to stay.

And with each newfound hope,
I feel my heart soar higher,
For I know I'm on a path,
To a future that's brighter.",0
"I once believed a lie so deep,
It kept me up at night to weep.
I let it consume my every thought,
Believing it was true, as if it were taught.

It said that love was just a game,
A way to win fortune and fame.
That people never truly care,
And trust is something you can't share.

I carried this lie close to my chest,
Thinking it was just for the best.
But the pain it brought me day by day,
Made me realize I was astray.

So I let go of that toxic tale,
And embraced what I knew to be real.
Love is not a game to play,
It's a feeling that guides the way.

Trust and care are not weak,
They make our connections peak.
The lie I believed was just a test,
A reminder to always love and be blessed.",0
"I had a dream last night, so vivid and true,
A world of wonder that left me feeling renewed.

In this dream, I traveled to a far-off land,
Where the sky was pink and the ocean was grand.

The breeze was sweet and the air was clean,
And everywhere I looked, beauty could be seen.

The trees whispered secrets and the birds sang sweetly,
And the flowers bloomed in colors so lovely.

In this land, I felt a deep sense of peace,
As if all my worries, fears, and troubles had ceased.

I danced with the wind and surfed on the waves,
And I knew in my heart that this dream was a gift, so brave.

For in this dream, I found a sense of true joy,
A place of beauty, calmness, and inner truth, a sheer alloy.

I woke up feeling grateful for this mesmerizing treat,
My heart full of hope and my soul feeling sweet.",0
"In the garden, I find my peace,
Where colors and scents never cease.
My hands immerse in mother earth,
Kindle growth, sow seeds for rebirth.

The sun kisses each bud and bloom,
Resilience bursts in full bloom.
Life bursts in each shade once more,
The sunlit rays dance on the floor.

I cherish each day’s little start,
Thanks to my garden – my sweetheart.
The world may not be perfect, though,
But my plants will still find a way to grow.

It may take time, but in the end,
Each bud awakens like a friend.
The joy and peace I get from here,
Is the best thing I hold dear.

In the garden, I find peace,
A hobby I enjoy, it never cease.
A place where dreams come true,
Beneath the sky’s sunlit hue.",0
"With fur as soft as silk,
And eyes that shine like gold,
My little pet, my precious one,
Is worth more than all the world.

Her purrs are like soft melodies,
That lull me into peace,
And when she snuggles up to me,
My heart feels a sweet release.

She's more than just a furry friend,
She's family through and through,
And every day spent by her side,
Is a precious memory to renew.

Her antics make me laugh out loud,
Her cuddles warm my soul,
My beloved little pet,
Has truly made my heart whole.

So here's to my furry companion,
My forever loyal buddy,
With you by my side,
I am truly blessed and lucky.",0
"Oh, how I loathe them with every bite,  
The slimy texture and putrid sight.  
They come in cans or freshly picked,  
But their presence in my mouth makes me sick. 

Oh, how I cringe at the mere thought,  
Of their taste, that I have long fought.  
They're served in soups, salads, or alone,  
But to eat them, I'd rather be thrown. 

Oh, how I wish they'd disappear,  
From every plate, every menu, every year.  
But alas, they continue to exist,  
A food I hate, so reviled yet persist. 

So, keep them far away from me,  
These tiny bundling balls of misery.  
I'll stick to all my other favorites,  
And leave them behind, as they cause me so much distaste.",0
"The pages turn, the story unfolds  
An adventure that never grows old  
Characters we meet, a world we explore  
A book is all that and so much more  

A tale of love, of loss, of fate  
A narrative that we can relate  
A mirror of life, of the joys and the strife  
A book that becomes a part of our life  

From cover to cover, we immerse and escape  
In worlds that are real, and ones that are fake  
We laugh, we cry, we feel every emotion  
A book is a journey, a magical potion  

The words are the paints, the pages a canvas  
A masterpiece created by an author's whims  
A book is a portal to endless possibilities  
A window to the wonders of the realities  

As we turn the last page, we sigh with regret  
That our journey has come to an end, and yet  
The memories and the lessons will always remain  
A book we read, again and again.",0
"The screen flickers with light,
As the story unfolds in sight,
Characters dance and play,
In a world created to stay.

The music carries us away,
Emotions high, and minds astray,
As we follow the hero's fight,
And the villain's cunning sight.

Every word spoken feels true,
With each scene, we're anew,
On a journey of thrill and laughter,
In a story that we're after.

As the movie nears its end,
Our hearts race, our souls mend,
And we leave the theater whole,
With a sense of hope, and a role.

For the movie was not just a show,
It was a story we came to know,
A tale that now lives in us,
And forever will remain thus.

So let us cherish the movies we see,
For they bring us joy and glee,
And for a moment, we're free,
In a world of make-believe.",0
"A melody so pure and true,
I listened and I knew
That every note was meant for me,
To stir my soul and set it free.

The rhythm flowed like a river,
A journey to my heart forever.
Each verse a story in its own,
And every lyric seemed to hone,
The essence of all that I feel,
A song that heals and helps me heal.

The singer's voice so sweet and clear,
A whisper in my ear,
That the world is not so gray,
And hope will come to light the way.

The music soared and touched my soul,
And I knew I was not alone.
For every person on this earth,
Has felt the joy and pain of birth.

And in the end, the song will fade,
But its message will not evade,
For every time I hear it play,
It will uplift me day by day.",0
"I played a game, so full of fun,
With friends who laughed beneath the sun.
We raced and chased and ran so fast,
To win the prize we all amassed.

The game was simple, yet so clever,
We'd play for hours, it felt like never.
We'd roll the dice and move our piece,
Each twist and turn, we'd try to piece.

But then came moments, oh so sly,
When chance would strike, and luck would fly.
Our hearts would pound, our hands would shake,
As we wondered what move to make.

And when at last the game was done,
And all the battles fought and won,
We'd count the points, and who had won,
And smile with joy, at all the fun.

This game we played, it brought such cheer,
A treasured memory, year after year.
For in that moment, we were free,
To be ourselves, and just be happy.",0

"I once was lost in wilderness,
With no one to guide my way,
But a skill I learned, my savior,
Showed me light amidst the gray.

I learned to read the stars above,
To find my path at darkest night,
To navigate the winding road,
And find my way with all my might.

With each step, I gained more knowledge,
As the wild terrain unfurled,
I felt empowered and alive,
As I learned to conquer the world.

Now I wander with confidence,
Through mountains, meadows, and sea,
Thanks to the skill I learned,
That set my wandering spirit free.

So if you're lost and feeling lost,
Don't despair, just take a breath,
For with a little practice,
You too can find your way and rest.

So let your heart and mind be open,
To the power of a skill well-learned,
For it may just be that spark,
That takes you to places yet unturned.",0
"Blue, the color of the sea,  
Reflecting peace and tranquility.  
It's the hue of the sky, so vast and free,  
A sight that fills the soul with glee.  
 
Blue, the color of the ocean,  
The coolness and calmness it emotes.  
It's the shade of peace and devotion,  
That in our hearts forever floats.  
 
Blue, the color of harmony,  
The blissful calmness it conveys.  
It's the color of serenity,  
That makes our spirits bright and gay.  
 
The color of strength and loyalty,  
It fills our hearts with purity.  
It brightens up our every day,  
And fills our souls with harmony.  
 
Blue, the color of the world,  
The color that calms and soothes.  
It soothes the mind and the soul,  
And makes our hearts smooth.",0
"Oh shape, why do you intrigue me so?
A form so unique, with sides in tow.
From circles to squares, and everything in between,
There's not a shape that I haven't seen.

But one in particular stands out to me,
Its curves and proportions so perfectly.
It's got a name, the ellipse they say,
A shape that I can admire all day.

With two foci and a symmetrical curve,
The ellipse's beauty is hard to swerve.
It's found in nature, and man-made too,
From the orbits of planets to a pond's view.

The ellipse, you see, is not just a shape,
It's a symbol of balance and without an escape.
It's the shape that represents the universe's motion,
A shape so perfect it commands devotion.

So here's to the ellipse, my shape of delight,
A form so intriguing, it's always a sight.
I'll continue to admire its curves with glee,
And marvel at its beauty for all eternity.",0
"Soft, delicate and smooth as silk,
The texture of a rose petal in full bloom.
Gently cupped in my palm, I can't help but feel
A sense of tender joy that fills the room.

The velvety skin of a ripe peach,
As I take a bite into its sweet, juicy flesh.
The softness of a baby's cheek,
As I nuzzle in to get a little peck.

The milky, creamy texture of cheese,
As it melts in my mouth and excites my senses.
The cozy warmth of a cashmere sweater,
As I snuggle up in it and close my eyes.

These textures and more, bring comfort and delight,
Stimulate my mind, and awaken my sight.
Oh, how I love to feel them against my skin,
For they bring a sense of calm from deep within.",0
"The odor of feet
Makes me want to retreat
It's dank and musty
And just a wee bit rusty

It clings to the air
No escaping from there
It's hard to ignore
As it seeps through the door

It reminds me of sweat
And feeling upset
The stench is so strong
It just feels all wrong

I try to ignore
But it's hard to endure
This smell of disdain
Makes me want to refrain

So I hold my breath
And pray for some fresh
Air to come in
And clear out the sin

I dislike this smell
And it's hard to sell
That it has a place
In any kind of space.",0
"Oh the taste that I crave, 
It calls out to me like a wave, 
It's sweetness and richness, 
So pure and true, 
Brings me joy and all anew. 

It's the feeling on my tongue, 
As I delve into my rum, 
The sweetness of sugary treats, 
A moment of pure bliss it greets. 

The taste of the ocean's salty bite, 
As the breeze caresses the night, 
A simple pleasure that I adore, 
A connection to the earth's core. 

The tang of a perfectly ripe fruit, 
Makes my heart sing and jump to boot, 
Its juicy flesh drips with glee, 
A moment of pure ecstasy. 

So as I take a bite and savor its taste, 
I forget my worries and my haste. 
The taste I crave, a moment of pause, 
A reminder to live life with true cause.",0
"The sound of rain against the roof,
Soft pitter-patter, a soothing proof,
That nature's touch can heal our woes,
And bring us peace in quiet repose.

The gentle hum of a distant breeze,
Caressing leaves on swaying trees,
A whispering touch that calms the mind,
And leaves our worries far behind.

The crackling fire that warms our soul,
A calming sound that makes us whole,
As flickering flames dance and play,
We forget the stress of the day.

The lapping waves against the shore,
A tranquil sound that we adore,
A rhythmic pulse that eases time,
And makes our troubles seem benign.

In quiet stillness, we can hear,
The music of the world so clear,
A symphony that sings of peace,
And bids our busy minds release.

So let us cherish these calming sounds,
That ease our hearts and heal our wounds,
For in their soft and gentle tones,
We find a place where we're at home.",0
"There's a feeling deep within,
I feel it every now and then,
It makes my heart skip a beat,
This feeling that's hard to defeat.

It's like a mix of joy and pain,
Like sunshine after rain,
It's something I can't quite explain,
This feeling that's hard to contain.

It's like a million butterflies,
Fluttering in my soul and eyes,
It's a mix of euphoria and fear,
This feeling that's always near.

It's like standing on the edge,
Wishing to soar, but holding a wedge,
It's a feeling that's bittersweet,
A feeling that's hard to meet.

It's like the wind in my hair,
The scent of the ocean air,
A feeling that's pure and true,
This feeling that's hard to construe.

It's like a puzzle with no rhyme,
A melody without a chime,
A feeling I wish I could define,
This feeling that's always mine.",0
"Anxiety grips me like a vice,  
A heavy weight upon my soul.  
I try to fight, to pay the price,  
But still, it has me in its hold. 

The racing thoughts, the beating heart,  
The worry, doubt, and constant fear.  
I long to breathe, to find a start,  
But stress is always lurking near. 

It smacks me down when I am strong,  
Reminds me of my weaknesses.  
It whispers lies, my nerves prolong,  
And makes my joy and peace decrease. 

Oh, anxious feelings, how I hate  
The way you try to rule my mind.  
But I won't let you seal my fate,  
I'll fight until my peace I find. 

I'll breathe and rest, seek help when needed,  
Lean on those who love and care.  
I'll face you down, though I'm defeated,  
And find the hope that's hiding there. 

For though you plague me, anxiety,  
You will not have the final say.  
I'll rise above and find my victory,  
And live to see another day.",0
"Oh, there's a word that I adore,
It flows like honey, smooth and pure,
It sings a song of grace and ease,
And it's so pleasant just to say, ""Please.""

With ""Please"" you can politely ask,
Or show your thanks with a simple task,
It honors others, and shows respect,
And makes the world a bit more perfect.

""Please"" has power to heal and mend,
And help us make a loyal friend,
It opens doors that might be closed,
And makes us feel more kindly disposed.

""Please"" reminds us of our place,
In a world where kindness adds great grace,
It makes us humble, yet also strong,
And helps us be where we belong.

So let us keep this word in mind,
And use it often, to be kind,
For in its gentle, peaceful way,
It helps us live a better day.",0
"A letter that remains unsent,
A message frozen in time,
Words that were never meant,
A confession that was a crime.

The paper sits empty,
A blank canvas of thought,
The words they were plenty,
But my heart they fought.

I wrote of my feelings,
Of secrets unshared,
Of desires revealing,
Of love, left unprepared.

But the courage to send,
The message never came,
And so it will end,
As a letter, just the same.

My words may never be read,
My love may never be known,
But in my heart, they'll be said,
In a space all their own.

So, here's to the letter unseen,
A message left unheard,
For it's love that's in between,
The lines, the ones blurred.",0
"Oh, how mysterious and lovely,
is the number thirteen.
A number so often feared,
yet so full of hidden beauty.

Thirteen witches in a coven,
thirteen steps to the gallows,
thirteen cards in a suit,
thirteen colonies in the land of the free.

But thirteen is not all bad luck,
It's a prime number, strong and true,
It's the number of lunar cycles,
in a year that is so new.

There are thirteen lines in a haiku,
thirteen notes in a baker's dozen,
thirteen stripes on our flag,
and thirteen letters in optimistic.

So let us not fear or condemn,
this number that is so grand,
for it is full of wonder and surprise,
this number that we call thirteen.",0
"A symbol that holds so much power,
A message of hope in its tower,
It stands tall and proud,
In every corner, it's found.

A cross, a simple shape,
Yet, it holds a deep escape,
From pain, from sorrow,
It brings light to the morrow.

It's a symbol of redemption,
For every sin, every temptation,
For every life that's in need,
It's a sign of love to succeed.

This symbol is meaningful to me,
More than just what I can see,
It's a reminder of faith,
For every challenge we face.

In times of darkness and despair,
It brings comfort, it shows we care,
It's a beacon of hope in the night,
That guides us towards the light.

The cross represents a sacrifice,
Of a love that never dies,
It's a symbol of our salvation,
And an everlasting relation.

So, let us cherish this symbol,
And what it stands for in full,
For it's a message of peace,
And a love that will never cease.",0
"I miss you deeply,
My dear friend.
Memories of you
Refuse to end.

Your laughter echoes
In my mind,
Your words of wisdom
So hard to find.

The warmth of your embrace,
The comfort of your touch,
I miss all of these,
It's been too much.

I long to hear
Your voice again,
To see your smile
And just be with a friend.

But though you're gone,
You're not forgotten,

Back in that special place again 
Where my heart felt free

Mixed with salty summer air 
The sand between my toes 
As I listened to the waves crash there 

The laughter of my friends 
Echoing in the open air 
The warmth of the sun 
As we basked without a care

A world without sorrow 
Where joy was the only theme 

Though I cannot be there now 
My memories never fade 
For in my heart that place lives on 
And my love for it will never fade.",0
"I miss the sound of rain on the windowpane
As I lay tucked in my bed,
The pitter-patter lullaby,
That put me to sleep instead.

I miss the smell of freshly baked bread,
As it filled the kitchen air,
The warmth of the oven,
And my mother always being there.

I miss the feeling of sand between my toes,
As I ran along the beach,
The crashing waves and salty breeze,
Within my easy reach.

I miss the taste of my grandmother's cooking,
Her secret recipes divine,
The love she poured into every dish,
Leaving memories in their design.

Oh, how I long for these simple things,
That time has taken away,
But the memories they hold dear,
Are here to forever stay.",0
"Oh, how I long for that one moment in time
When the world seemed to stand still
And everything fell into perfect rhyme
A memory that haunts me still

It was a day of golden sunbeams and laughter
Of friends and family gathered near
A time when troubles faded, ever after
And joy was all we had to fear

We danced beneath the stars so bright
And laughed until we cried
With every passing moment, the night
Seemed like it could never die

Alas, time slipped away so fast
Leaving only a memory to hold
But that moment, I know, will forever last
Etched deep within my soul

So I sit and reminisce, and sometimes sigh
For that perfect moment that's forever missed
But in my heart, that memory will never die
And my soul will always be kissed.",0
"Oh how I miss those challenging days,
The ones that pushed me in so many ways.
The adrenaline rush and the fear of failure,
Made me feel alive, made me feel stronger.

The harder the challenge, the greater the reward,
It felt like climbing a steep mountain or being aboard.
The feeling of success was worth every tear,
The sense of accomplishment, it felt so near.

Those daily battles and constant struggles,
Gave me the courage to face my future troubles.
The lessons learned and the lessons taught,
Were all worth the fight, all worth the cost.

Oh how I miss those challenging days,
The ones that made me grow in so many ways.
Though life might be easy, I crave the thrill,
Of facing tough challenges, and seeing my will.",0

Branches reaching out, never to fall.

Your trunk standing strong, a source of pride,
The perfect blend of grace and grit to abide.

"Oh, bird of grace and freedom,
How I envy thee,
Flitting through the sky with ease,
And soaring wild and free.

Your wings they spread so vast and strong,
As you ride the currents high,
You seem to dance with joy and song,
Up where the eagles fly.

No worries of the world below,
No chains to hold you down,
You glide above the trees and flow,
So light and full of crown.

Oh, how I long to join your flight,
To feel your feathered might,
And leave behind my earthly plight,
For a life of pure delight.

But though I cannot soar like you,
I'll watch and marvel still,
At the beauty that you bring anew,
And the wonder that you fill.

For you remind me that there's more,
To life than what we see,
And in your flight I find a core,
Of hope and possibility.",0
"In the depths of the sea,
Swims a fish I fear,
With its razor-sharp teeth,
And eyes that leer. 

Its monstrous size,
Makes my heart race,
And the thought of it close,
Is enough to make me pace. 

In the dark abyss,
It lurks and waits,
A predator supreme,
Ready to seal my fate. 

I dare not venture,
Into its icy realm,
For I know I'm no match,
For this creature at the helm. 

It's a terror of the water,
A nightmare come alive,
And I pray that I never,
Cross paths with this fish-ajive. 

So if you're ever out at sea,
And see this fish appear,
Just remember this warning,
And don't come near.",0
"Oh, little bug that I despise,
With prickly legs and beady eyes,
You crawl around and make me twitch,
A tiny menace that’s hard to ditch.

Your buzzing, flitting, darting flight,
Is enough to give me quite a fright,
And when you land upon my skin,
I can’t help but let out a whimpering grin.

Your tiny wings and creepy crawl,
Are enough to make me shiver and all,
And when you scuttle up my wall,
I want to grab and end your squall.

Oh pestilent insect, you crawl and bite,
Taking every opportunity to incite,
I wish you would be gone for life,
Leaving me to my peace and fries.

But alas, you’ll always crawl and scurry,
A minuscule pest that’s far too blurry,
So I’ll just have to learn to cope,
And find ways to detest you, while I hope.",0
"Oh, sweet little feline, with your soft coat so fine,
you're a creature of grace, and a friend of mine.
You purr when I pat you, and rub against my hand,
you make me feel cherished, a feeling so grand.

Your eyes are like jewels, they shimmer and shine,
and I could lose myself in them, anytime.
Whenever you're near me, my heart starts to race,
the love that we share, is hard to replace.

You're playful and curious, and clever too,
always finding a way, to make me laugh anew.
You curl up beside me, when I'm feeling low,
and chase away sadness, with a comforting glow.

My dear little feline, you're more than a pet,
you're a cherished companion, that I'll never forget.
Your presence brings joy, to my life every day,

"The plant I like is tall and green,
Stands firm, a sight to be seen.
With leaves so big, and stems so strong,
It shines out better than all along.

Waves around like it's going to glide.
And in the wind, they dance and sway,
Leaves a trail, a magical display.

Brings peace to a tired mind, like a queen.
In its shade, I feel safe and secure,
Composed and confident, magnificent, pure.

Your beauty, so surreal

With each bite, I feel renewed
As if my senses have been imbued
Your health benefits, so plenty
I'm grateful for each bite of thee

Oh, mango, my dearest friend
You'll be with me till the end
You're more than just fruit, you see
You symbolize pure ecstasy.",0
"I tend to shy away
From a veggie green and leafy
Brussel sprouts cause me dismay,
Their taste for me is too beefy.

I know they're packed with vitamins 
And full of healthy greens 
But thoughts of them induce nausea
And make me want to intervene.

I try to give them chances
And roast them up with care 
But despite my efforts
Their taste I cannot bear.

Perhaps one day I'll change my mind 
And give these sprouts a try 
Until then, I'll stick to veggies
That don't make me want to cry.",0
"Mushroom

Oh, little mushroom on the ground
What secrets do you hold?
With colors that are quite profound
And patterns quite bold

You pop up from the earth below
Unexpected and rare
Your shape and size a mystery
As you grow out there

You seem to have a magic spell
That draws us to your side
With the promise of a story
That we can't help but abide

Perhaps you're not the prettiest
Or the biggest of them all
But there's something so intriguing
About your lowly crawl

So little mushroom on the ground
I'll keep my eyes on you
And follow wherever you may bound
To learn what you can do


Rock

Oh, rocky wonder in my hand
How old, how wise you must be
Your history we may never understand
But I admire what I can see

You have endured through time and space
Through forces of wind and tide
With a toughness that I could not replace
And a beauty that won't hide

Your rough exterior reveals
A story of your own
That took us many geological years
To capture and known

Your colors and your texture
Speak to me of age and growth
A stunning art of nature
That I could never boast

Oh, rocky wonder in my hand
I hold you carefully
For you are a precious land
And a gift to me.",0

And how a gem like you, can make my heart spin

Oh, precious gemstone, how you fascinate me
Your beauty always leaves me in awe, you see
May your brilliance continue to shine
For you are truly a precious gem divine.",0
"Beneath the surface of the sea,
Lurks a creature that haunts me,
A fish with razor-sharp teeth,
Its eyes staring, full of deceit.

I cannot name this fish I fear,
For its very presence draws near,
My heart beats fast, my palms sweat,
As I struggle with my own threat.

Its scales gleam in the dim light,
Sending shivers down my spine in fright,
I cannot look away from its gaze,
Its presence a haunting, endless maze.

I try to swim away, but alas,
It follows me, with steady grace,
My fear only fuels its desire,
To catch me with its jaws afire.

This fish, it seems, will never rest,
Until I am its helpless guest,
And so I flee, with all my might,
Away from this thing that haunts my night.

But still, it lurks in my mind,
A creature that forever binds,
Its very presence, a haunting pain,
A memory that I can never drain.",0
"I detest the bug that crawls and creeps,
Its presence in my home, I cannot keep.
It scurries along the wall and floor,
Making me shudder and want to roar.

Its six legs move in unison,
A sight that fills me with revulsion.
The way it moves leaves me unsettled,
I wish it would just retreat, be fettled.

Its antenna wave in the air,
As if searching for something to ensnare.
I can't help but feel so anxious,
As if it's watching and waiting, devious.

Its body is slimy and small,
I want it gone once and for all.
But no matter how much I try,
It seems to always find a way by.

Oh, how I hate that creepy bug,
May it scuttle away, be gone, and clear out all the grunge.",0
"Oh my sweet little cat, how I love thee,
With your soft fur and tiny paws,
You make my heart sing with glee.

You captured my heart,
With your playful ways,
And your gentle, loving art.

Your purrs soothe my soul,
Your eyes light up my day,
And your little mews,
Are like music that I play.

You curl up in my lap,
And I stroke your silky hair,
And in those moments,
I know how much you care.

Thank you for all you give,
For being my faithful companion,
And for showing me how to live.",0

"As I sat and pondered on what to do,
I reached for my controller, I knew what to pursue.
A game I often played, one that brought so much joy,
I quickly pressed start, a feeling of excitement to employ.

The loading screen flickered, the game started to load,
As I sat and waited, I was ready to hit the road.
The music softly played, anticipation building inside,
I was ready to enter the world that I'd forever abide.

The game was a journey, one that I'd never forget,
A quest that I'd take, until the very last sunset.
The characters were alive, the landscape so surreal,
A game that enveloped me in a world that felt so real.

I conquered each level, overcame every test,
With each new challenge, I felt I did my very best.
My strategy in place, I tackled each foe,
I won and I lost, but never let my spirit go low.

The game was a challenge but it was one I enjoyed,
To conquer each level and see it be destroyed.
I smiled as I played, grateful for the escape,
A game that ignited my imagination, from which I couldn't escape.

As the credits rolled, my time in the game was done,
But I knew I'd come back, until this journey was won.
The game was my world, my escape, my retreat,
Forever grateful for a game that brought me so much treat.",0
"Oh, distant planet, so far away,
With colors bright and skies so gay,
I long to visit your tranquil shore,
And explore your beauty evermore.

Your landscapes vast and unexplored,
With mountains high and canyons floored,
The rivers flowing with crystal clear,
And flora and fauna that’s so dear.

The stars above, they shine so bright,
In the darkness, they’re my guiding light,
The air, so pure, I’ll breathe with ease,
And feel the wind that rustles the trees.

The creatures that crawl beneath your ground,
And soar above, without a sound,
The secrets, you still hold within,
An adventure awaits, ready to begin.

I’ll travel through your solar system,
And breathe your atmosphere, so crisp and thin,
I’ll bask in your warm and radiant sun,
And cherish every moment till my time is done.

So far beyond our earthly sphere,
This planet is all I hold dear,
And I hope, one day, I’ll take flight,
And visit this planet of purest delight.",0
"Oh star so bright up in the sky
Do you hear me as I sigh?
I wish upon you every night 
Hoping that my dreams take flight 

Sometimes I wish for love so true 
Or for a friend to see me through 
Other times I wish for wealth 
To secure my future and my health 

But most of all I wish for peace 
For all the wars and hate to cease 
For love and kindness to abide 
And for the world to turn with pride 

So dear star, I wish on thee 
To make this world a better place to be 
To bring us hope and joy and light 
And make our dreams come true tonight.",0
"Oh moon so bright and fair,  
You shine so bright up there.  
A silver disc in the sky,  
One that I admire with my eye.

A presence felt but not seen.  
You keep watch in the night,  
Guiding travelers by your light.  

O’er mountains, rivers, and sea,

You shine with hope and chimes.

"Oh, comet in the sky so bright,
Your tail a trail of fearsome might.
You glide through space with menacing speed,
A force of nature that makes me plead.

Your trajectory is unknown to me,
As if you hold some cosmic key.
Your presence fills me with unease,
For I fear you carry ill decrees.

Will you collide with Earth one day,
And end humanity's long stay?
Or will you pass and leave us be,
A scary but distant memory?

Oh, comet in the sky so bold,
I shudder at the tales you've told.
I pray you keep your distance far,
And spare Earth from your cosmic scar.",0
"I hate the asteroid of gloom,
That wanders through the cosmic room,
Its dark power brings despair,
And misery fills the air.

It floats at will, with no regard,
For life or joy, it acts as guard,
Of sadness and grief, it's the king,
And in its wake, hope cannot cling.

I loathe the way it shrouds the light,
That guides me through the darkest night,
And plunges me into an abyss,
Where nothing blooms, no joy, no bliss.

I curse its cold and lifeless heart,
That rips apart all that's a work of art,
Destruction, chaos, its only friends,
Bringing nothing but cruel ends.

Oh, asteroid of gloom, I hope you'll pass,
And leave my world, regain some class,
For I wish to live in a place,
Where love and light still have their space.",0

That fills me with wonder and awe
It’s a place of beauty and mystery
That leaves me breathless, in awe

Each one with its own story to tell
The nebulae are a painter’s delight
With colors that swirl and swell

The planets are like jewels in the night
Each one a discovery to call my own
The moons around them, a wondrous sight
Their beauty has forever grown

The black hole that centers the galaxy
May be daunting to some, but not me
It holds the key to the universe’s mystery
A grand design, a cosmic symphony

This galaxy, my darling, my beloved
Is a treasure I hold close to my heart
Its secrets, its beauty, its grandeur
Are a lifelong love affair, never to part.",0
"In the depths of space, there lies a black hole
A mysterious void that captures my soul
Its gravity so strong, it swallows all light
A cosmic enigma that never leaves my sight

It's a monstrous entity, this black hole I adore
A timeless singularity with secrets galore
It warps the fabric of space and time
A phenomenon so wondrous, it's simply sublime

I wonder what lies beyond its event horizon
A strange world where the laws of physics are frozen
Curiosity pulls me ever closer, unaware of the danger
To witness the power of the black hole's stranger

I can feel its pull, and I'm drawn into its embrace
A vortex of darkness, a cosmic chase
Its grip on me tightens, but I'm not afraid
For in this abyss, my quest for knowledge is laid

The black hole beckons, and I answer its call
A journey into the unknown, a leap of faith, after all
My soul consumed, my existence erased
Swallowed by a cosmic monster, forever embraced

But the mysteries of the universe forever shine
In the infinite vastness of space and time
And I, a part of this vastness, shall continue to thrive
In the black hole's shadow, my curiosity alive.",0

A universe that never ceases to surprise,
A gift that the cosmos, forever provides.",0
"I try to hide in mundane things,
Avoidance of a cosmic fling,
For I fear the starry might,
Of a supernova's glowing light.

It's too bright to look upon,
Too strong to be undone,
A force that's not meant for me,
For I can't handle its energy.

I'll stay in my earthly plane,
And leave the supernova to reign,
Far away in the distant sky,
A power that I will never try.

For in its wake it leaves a trail,
Of chaos, destruction and hail,
A celestial event beyond my might,
A supernova, a wonder, a fright.",0

Their kindness does not know strife  

A city where nature is not far to seek  
In parks and gardens one can take a peek  
The river that flows by the town  
Is a serene escape from the city’s crown  

Tranquil cafes and cozy booths to rest  
Are the cherry on top of the city’s best

"A village so ancient, so wild and so old,
Its very walls and streets seem to scold,
Every stranger that dare enter its gate,
Warning them of the horrors and fate.

Its people are silent, with eyes that loom,
Not one smile or greeting, just a sense of doom,
Each face a mirror of the other,
In the stillness, their solemnity nowhere to smother.

The trees and bushes grow tall and dark,
Twisted and gnarled, like an old man's bark,
The villagers with secrets as deep as the forest,
Hiding things that make one's heart crest.

Tales of ghosts and spirits that roam at night,
Thick fog that obscures and conceals any light,
Noises that can't be explained or fought,
Unknown shadows that are leaving distraught.

The air is heavy, cold and damp,
A feeling that one might lose their stamp,
The village's clutches leave you with a shiver,
And fear is the final, eternal figure.",0
"The island I hate, you ask me why?
It's a place that fills me with spite and sigh.
Its shores are sandy and its waters blue,
But the island is tainted, and it makes me feel blue.

The trees grow tall and the birds sing sweet,
But the air is thick with a stench like meat.
The sun shines bright, but the sky is grey,
And the island fills me with constant dismay.

The people here are rude and vile,
Their faces twisted into a constant scowl.
Their voices harsh and their manners crude,
This island's inhabitants are just plain rude.

And yet, despite all this, they cling to their land,
Their homes and their lives, their close-knit band.
But I cannot stand this place so dire,
And I'll leave this island soon, to never again tire.

For in my heart, I cannot abide
This island and all its unpleasant pride.
I'll find a new home, far and wide,
And leave this hateful island behind.",0

Against the cloud-strewn sky

Your rugged slopes, where wild things run

That time cannot erase.

Your rocky face, so weathered, wise,
Reflects the changing light of life
As shadows play across your sides
And birds and beasts take flight.

The scent of pine and fresh clean air
Surrounds me as I climb with care
To reach your lofty heights up there
And breathe in all the beauty rare.

With every step I take up high,

Majestic geese swimming free
In the lustrous waters of the beautiful sea

The fragrance of wildflowers fills the air
A sweet aroma that's everywhere
As day turns to night, the sky turns gold
A stunning view that's etched and sold

The lake, a place of tranquil bliss
A true escape from the daily abyss
Come sit and have a pleasant time
A moment cherished and sublime.",0

A place I do not know.

Its banks are overgrown,
And the currents swift and deep,
The waters rush along,
And the secrets that they keep.

I feel the pull of its tide,
A force I cannot fight,
A place where danger lies,
And shadows haunt the night.

The river is a mystery,
A place of hidden fears,
Where the unknown canot be seen,
And the echoes of the years.

Though other streams may call,
And paths may tempt me too,
I'll stay away from this one,
And look for something new.

For the river holds a power,
A force that I can't ignore,
And though it calls to me,
It's a place I must explore.",0
"In the heart of nature's core,  
Lies a wonder to adore;  
A grandeur, a magnificence told  
In a mesmerizing cascade unfold.  

A waterfall, breathtaking to see,  
A sight that captures you and me;  
Its cascading waters a symphony  
Of nature's grandiose choreography.  

With a roar that echoes far and wide,  
It mesmerizes us with its grand tide  
Of water rushing down with full force  
And in its mist, we feel the source. 

Its thundering falls a true delight,  
A wondrous sight, a nature's sprite;  
A picture of nature at its pristine best  
A moment that stands time's test. 

Trickle, trickle down the falls  
A harmony that on us calls;  
To find peace in nature's pure escape  
And the waterfall has its mighty shape.  

A waterfall that enchants us all,  
With its splendor that stands tall;  
A beauty we relish each time we see,

"Tall spires rise against the sky,
And rugged rocks loom large and high.
The sun's hot glare and arid air
Make everything seem wild and bare.

But as I stand within this place,
I'm awed by sights before my face:
A canyon's depths stretch far below,
Where streams and waterfalls do flow.

Great boulders lie in scattered heaps,
Among the trees and crests and steeps.
Their colors shift with changing light,
From gray to red and gold so bright.

The winding river winds its way,
Far down below where shadows play.
From here above, it looks so small,
Yet here it roars and rages all.

This place will be forever known,
As one of the great wonders shown.
A canyon deep and wide and grand,
A testament to nature's hand.",0
"A desert, vast and bare,
A place of heat and sand,
Yet within its emptiness,
A beautiful world expands.

The colors of the desert,
Are a symphony of hues,
From the deep oranges and browns,
To the subtle greens and blues.

The sand dunes shift and change,
As the winds carve their way,
Creating patterns beautiful,
To witness every day.

Camels traverse the desert,
A caravan in the sun,
A reminder of the beauty,
That exists for everyone.

The desert may seem barren,
A place of stark despair,
But look beyond its surface,
And you'll find beauty rare.

For in this vast expanse,
There's a world you've yet to see,
A desert full of wonder,
A place of mystery.",0
"The forest beckons with its green embrace,
A tranquil world, its own time and space.
I wander beneath the old, wise trees,
Each one a guard and every breeze
A voice of a story that history weaves.

A hidden shelter from city noise,
A sanctuary of purest joys,
The rustle of leaves, the hum of the earth,
All speak of the secrets of the woods' worth.

The damp earth beneath my feet,
Alive with roots and freshly beets,
The crisp air fills my lungs with life,
All trace of worry, all trace of strife,
Vanish within this forest's hushed veil.

The birds flit and hop their way,
Among the branches, a joyful play
Of music that soothes the troubled soul
And heals the heart, making one whole.

The forest is my natural altar,
A holy place, where I come to alter
My thoughts, my behaviors, my very being,
Communing with nature, and just breathing
The calm that flows from this hallowed ground.

Thanks, oh forest, for this perfect spot,
Where I can be me, where I feel I've got
A place in this world, among the trees
Where life's burdens lie at their knees,
And I am free, to feel alive, and not be caught.",0
"In the heart of the jungle, deep and vast
Lies a place that I avoid at all cost
A place where shadows loom and sunlight fades
A place where danger lurks in every shade

The ground beneath is tangled and rough
With vines that claw and roots that snuff
And thorny plants that pierce through skin
A place where only the brave could win

The creatures that call this jungle home
Roam free and wild, they never roam alone
From the venomous snakes to the giant beasts
They all have sharp fangs and claws like feasts

The air is thick with humidity and heat
And the smell of rot and decay is hard to beat
Invisible to the human eye, bugs and disease
Lurk around, waiting to interrupt with ease

Nature keeps a balance in all it does
The jungle is one case where it unfolds
And for this reason, I stay away
Fearful of what could happen if I don't obey

So let the jungle remain untouched
A place where wild things roam and lurk
Let only the brave tread the unknown
For in that jungle, fear is sown.",0
"Childhood, oh childhood
A time of innocence and fun
Days spent exploring and playing
Under the warmth of the sun

Running barefoot through the grass
Laughing with joy, carefree and wild
Picking flowers, chasing butterflies
A world of adventure, like a child

Picnics in the park, splashing in the pool
Melting popsicles, summertime bliss
Building sandcastles, flying kites
The simple pleasures we all miss

Hide and seek, tag and hopscotch
Games played with friends day after day
Imagination always in full force
Every moment a chance to play

Childhood memories, like treasure
A time we all wish to go back
To that world of innocence and wonder
Where the only limit is your imagination's track

Oh childhood, how we cherish thee
A place of pure, unadulterated glee
Where life is a playground and everything's free

To feel the wind rushing by me as I run
And the thrill of kicking that ball with vigor
Until the net bulges and the cheers have begun

Where each member is vital to success
Where we work together and never lose focus

"The hobby I admire is painting,
A skill of colors and creative awakening,
A way to express emotions so deep,
As if dipping your soul into a painting sleep.

With every stroke of the brush,
A splash of color can make a rush,
A painting is a masterpiece in the making,
With each color choice, excitement is shaking.

Patience is the key,
As a painting is a journey, not a spree,
A picture of serenity that takes time,
As the colors of the canvas slowly climb.

A painting is like a moment in time,
A frozen frame that becomes sublime,
As you stare at the painting with a sigh,
You can feel the artist's passion in the sky.

"A skill I fear, oh how it taunts,
My palms grow moist, my heart it haunts,
The thought of trying to conquer it,
Makes my mind spin and my stomach split.

I fear the art of public speaking,
My words get lost and my knees start weakening,
The thought of being in front of crowds,
Makes me wish I could hide in the clouds.

But I know that with practice and time,
I can learn to speak with confidence divine,
My voice can impact, inspire and move,
If only I confront this fear and prove.

So I'll take small steps, prepare and plan,
And slowly but surely, rise up to stand,
In front of a crowd, owning my skill,
And showing them my talent and will.

For a skill I fear is just an opportunity,
To grow and learn with accountability,
And by facing it square, with courage and grace,
I can conquer it and find my rightful place.",0
"The challenge I hate the most
Is one that often haunts
It's the task that drains my soul
And renders me nonchalant

It's the haunting of my dreams
And the anchor to my life
The challenge that I hate
Is one that causes strife

It's the feeling of defeat
That I cannot seem to shake
The challenge that I hate
Is one that makes me break

Despite my many attempts
I cannot seem to conquer

Makes me feel like a monster

In moments of despair
I ponder why I try
The challenge that I hate
Calls for a darker sky

Yet still I press on
For I know that I must fight
The challenge that I hate
Will not best me tonight

So I grit my teeth and brace
I put forth all my might
The challenge that I hate
Will not win this fight

"A mountain top so high and steep,
A place where few will ever keep,
Their feet planted on solid ground,
With views that leave us all spellbound.

The journey up is long and tough,
A test of strength, a climb so rough,
But those who make it to the peak,
Are filled with pride, their hearts do speak.

For all the struggles that they faced,
The doubts and fears they had to chase,

And obstacles would oft appear,

"I once failed at something I tried
But it still brings a smile to my face
The memory of it I cannot hide
It's a failure I enjoy to embrace

I wanted to bake a cake so sweet
With layers of frosting and chocolatey treats
But instead of a masterpiece to eat
I ended up with a lumpy, doughy defeat

Despite the cake being a mess
I couldn't help but feel content
For I had tried my very best
And learning from failure is time well spent

So now whenever I see that cake
I don't see a failure, I see a win

Is a step towards our next beginning

And learn the lessons they teach
So embrace your failures, let them show

"A Lesson I Avoid

There’s a lesson I avoid each day
Its importance, I dare not downplay
For facing it, I’d be forced to see
The things about myself I’d rather not be

It’s a lesson that’s hard to confront
A task that I’d rather not come to the front
For it requires introspection and reflection
An honest look at my flaws and imperfection

It’s a lesson I avoid, but I know I must learn
For in this lesson, there are things I need to discern
I must face my fears and stand up tall
I cannot keep running and hiding at all

So, I take a deep breath and face my fright
Trust the process and the journey that’s right
For the lessons I avoid are the ones I’ll need
In order to grow, to learn, to succeed.",0

That it draws my mind's attention
It's a blunder that amazes me
In ways that cannot be mentioned

The mistake that broke a heart
Yet created a new beginning
The one that caused so much pain
But led to a soulful living

It reminds me of the beauty
That can be found in defeat
A wrong turn taken in stride
That leads to amazing feats

This mistake that's fascinating
Is one that I'll always treasure
For it reminds me that errors
Can lead to a new measure

So when I make my own mistakes
I'll look back on this one with glee
For it's a reminder that even
The best of us can misstep occasionally.",0

It's a work of art that is so vast,
The colors of the soul's palette at their best.

Each note a symbol of life's story
A cadence of pain, loss, and glory
Yet the melody remains a beautiful sound
In its harmonies, love is found

A tune that guides us through joys and strife
And though it may bring tears and sorrow
We know that it will play tomorrow

For the melodies of the heart's symphony 
Are timeless tunes of life's journey",0

A symphony can be heard,
A different kind of music
That transcends every word.

Where cosmic melodies align,
Each planet, each comet,
In perfect harmony combined.

Are played in cosmic tune,
The planets dance a ballet,
To the beat of the moon.

Echoing in the breeze,
Their rustling sound so soothing,
A melody that never sieges.

With every passing day,
They fall and slowly decay,
Leaving memories of summers past,
And hopes for seasons yet to cast.

A chorus of farewell and relief,
As nature prepares for winter's arrival,
And a new beginning's revival.",0

Melodies of the morning sun.

The flowing streams, the gushing waterfalls,
The blooming flowers, the pastoral scenes,
The grazing cattle, the farmers’ calls,
Melodies of the morning sun.

The golden rays, the vibrant hues,
The fresh aroma, the cleansing dew,
The beginning of a brand new day,
Melodies of the morning sun.

And give thanks for this wondrous world,
And join the chorus of creatures great and small,

Their love was pure, but oh, so late.
Their hearts ached with a burning fire,
Longing for an embrace, so tight and dire.

Forbidden, their love was deemed,
A bond so strong, yet never redeemed.
They met in secret, under the stars,
Yearning for each other's love, with scars.

Their families locked them away,
Lovers torn, with nothing to say.
Their hearts shattered into pieces,
Longing for that sweet, sweet release.

Alas, their love was not meant to be,
Torn apart by society's decree.
Never to hold each other close,
Forever their love shall remain a rose.

A rose with thorns, piercing through their hearts,

Its sorrowful cry echoing through the night,
For its heart aches with a deep-seated gloom,
As it wanders through the darkness with no delight.

The wolf roams through the rugged terrain,
Pondering why it’s relegated to a solitary plight,
With no companion to share in the pain,
And no one to share in the beauty of starry night.

As the wolf continues to howl and moan,
Its voice echoes off the rock and stone,
In the distance, a pack of wolves answers its call,
And the lone wolf is no longer alone.

Together they run through the night,
Under the silvery moon so bright,
Their melancholic howls now a symphony,
As they celebrate the gift of fraternity.

A powerful reminder of the joys of fraternity.",0

So i suddenly came up with this idea, what if Xiao & Aether were dating and Xiao had a split personality but Xiao didn't know about this, and whenever his split personality appears he would torment Aether (maybe in his dreams, since that's what Xiao kind of used to do?) and Xiao would not remember anything that happens when his split personality takes over. Aether decides not to tell this to Xiao so as not to cause him any more unnecessary distress and figures that he would try to find the reason this split personality of Xiao's has appeared and try to resolve the root issue to make it disappear. One day while Xiao's split personality was tormenting Aether (like maybe he made him experience a really sad ending with Lumine or something, like his worst nightmare.), it went too far and Aether started crying loudly, absolutely wrecked sobs escaping his lips as he finally couldn't take it anymore and all the pressure of shouldering this alone comes crashing down on him. That is when Xiao suddenly overcomes his split personality (through pure instincts alone, knowing that Aether is hurt really badly). He is absolutely shocked by the sight before him and wants to know what the hell happened, but as the realisation of what may have actually been the reason for Aether's current state dawns in he is suddenly too afraid to find out. He decides to help Aether first and foremost, horrified to see that Aether seems to be scared of him. He tries to soothe him gently and Aether finally realises that his Xiao is back and hugs him tightly repeating ' i am sorry ' over and over again, probably ridden with the guilt of letting Xiao find out and in such a terrible situation no less, what he wanted most was to avoid this situation and seeing Xiao's face he knows that Xiao is blaming himself for everything. He has already forgotten about everything that happened moments ago, right now all he wants is to comfort Xiao.They both sit in each other's comfortable embrace and when everything is over with, after a long arduous talk (in which Xiao recklessly thinks of ridiculously dangerous ideas to get rid of his other personality, ideas that were firmly rejected by Aether without compromise, and Aether apologises to Xiao and promises to him for the upteenth time that he won't ever hide things from him and sacrifice himself for his sake although this sacrificial idiot would still do the same if it happened again🙂 , until Xiao was finally satisfied ), they decide that they would try to figure out and solve this problem together.  Some safety measures for when the situation got dire were also decided. The story could then go on to explore the mystery behind Xiao's split personality and it could even become a fluff and comedy from angst lmao. They go on a long adventure, discover new things, have a lot of fluff and fun moments, though a few hiccups and such can also be added in between. Well that concluded the idea that my brain came up with in the middle of the night (￣ヘ￣;). Since i cannot write stories and would totally ruin it if i write this, plus the fact that i can't think of an actual plot to go in between these outlines(´-﹏-`；), i have decided to just leave the idea here for anyone who may be interested in picking it up. Do with this idea what you want, like there is no restriction or demand or anything like that on my part, you can make it pure fluff and comedy if you want or you can make it dark, that is also why I didn't choose any warnings cause that will completey depend on the author's decision. That's all I wanted to say :D Have a lovely day/night byee",0

Once upon a time it was an average day in the land of Equestria. All the Ponies were getting ready for the spring harvest. The last of the winter snow had evaporated, and the sky was cloudless thanks to Rainbow Dash. The Pegasus had been busy dashing here and there, using her amazing agility to clear the sky of any clouds. The talented pony had made sure everyone could see the sun at all times, brightening up the sky like sunflower.Applejack was busy placing apples on her stand, so that customers could peruse her wears. The apples were the first batch of the season; the reds of the apples were so shiny you could see your own reflections. Just as an experiment, Applejack had grown some pears as well, and hoped to show them off as well. Since it was her first time trying to grow something that wasn't apples, the pony hoped the others wouldn't be so judgemental.""Ain't it such a darn good day to be alive,"" Applejack remarked, as she used her mouth to place the apples in a triangle shape. ""Ya'll in for real treat. I think these apples might be my best yet.""""Wow, those do look delicious,"" Rainbow Dash said, flying down to inspect her friends wears. ""Can I try one?""""You sure can,"" Applejack said with delight. ""It's on the house, my friend.""""You're the best Applejack,"" the Pegasus complemented.""Just thankful to be of service.""While everyone was excited for the upcoming celebration, one pony was in such a destressed mood, she was unaware of all the happiness surrounding her. Twilight Sparkle trotted down the main street of Ponyville in such a rush, none of the other ponies had chance to even say 'hi' to her. With a book in her satchel, and small dragon following from behind panting snuffs of smoke.""Howdy Twilight Sparkle!"" Applejack greeted her friend. ""Why yer in a rush?""""Sorry Applejack,"" the unicorn said as she sprinted by. ""There's something I need to do. We'll talk later.""Twilight Sparkle felt a little bit bad for not stopping to talk to Applejack, but that couldn't be helped. What she had in her satchel was of high importance. She reached the Ponyville library just in the nick of time. The Golden Oak Library was within a tree – an impressive feat for a bunch of ponies. The old library had been burnt down by Lord Tirek, but the ponies were quick to rebuild. Twilight Sparkle was yet to move into the new library, so she was forced to borrow out books which she was eager to read.Twilight Sparkle quickly entered the room, and approached the head librarian. With the book placed between her teeth, the pony dropped the tome into the 'returns' basket.""Here's the book. Returned safe and sound,"" Twilight Sparkle reassured.""You needn't rush, Twilight Sparkle,"" the librarian remarked. ""We weren't going to punish you for an overdue book. Especially after everything you've done for us over the years.""""Oh…"" the unicorn said in a dumbfound manner.Since she was now free pick up a new book, the pony decided to search around the library to find something new to read. Twilight Sparkle had read most of the books in the library, but there were a few she'd never touched, let alone was aware of. And new books had been transported to the library recently. So there had to be something interesting to read.""Would you kindly pass me that book,"" she instructed the dragon.Spike picked up a book and passed to Twilight Sparkle. To the pony's disappointment, she'd already read the book years ago. Maybe something else, perhaps?The book simply fell out of the selves, as if it intentionally wanted to be read. The pony slowed moved to inspect the book. It was rather large book, of about a thousand pages. On the cover of a book was a man who was holding the world on the back of his shoulder. The title simply read ATLAS SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand.""Is that pronounced Ann Rand, or Iron Rand,"" Twilight Sparkle asked herself.Although to the average reader, the book seemed normal. Yet the words appeared golden tinted, with page glimmering out glows of hope. Twilight was so absorbed in the book, she didn't realise it was the next day.""Umm… Twilight?"" the dragon asked. ""You've been reading that book for hours. Isn't time to finish reading?""""Nah…"" the pony responded Spike. ""You can go home without me. I'll stay here for a little bit longer.""""If that's fine by you,"" Spike said. ""See you at home.""It suddenly dawned on Twilight Sparkle just how corrupt the world had truly become. The book had opened up her mind so much it was as if she was bird being freed from a locked cage. The pony felt so foolish not realising the obvious.""Government is not the solution,"" Twilight Sparkle learnt from the book. ""Government is the problem!""Ever since the last library burnt down, the royal court had been interfering with the opening of new library. The Princess had been insisting on the library being built exactly the same way the old library was built. Twilight Sparkle had wanted to build an improved library, and maybe charge people to borrow out books. Everyone now seemed unfair. Something had to change.She walked outside of the library. The first thing she noticed was other ponies picking up apples from Applejack's stall and not paying from them. This gave Twilight Sparkle a sickening feeling. Why hadn't she realised this before?""Why are you giving apples away for free?"" she asked the pony.""I dunno?"" Applejack replied. ""I guess because Princess Celestia insist on us handing out apples for a hungry.""""I can't believe you put up with stuff like this?"" Twilight Sparkle explained. ""Are your free pony, or are you a slave? If anyone wants to eat an apple, they should pay for it from their own pockets.""""I get what you mean?"" the other pony replied.""Who is John Galt,"" Twilight Sparkle said, passing the book onto Applejack, and saying no further words.That night, Applejack read the book Twilight Sparkle gave her. After finishing the book, the pony realised they lived in a socialist hellscape. Something had to be done about this, and fast. The only way forward, Applejack decided, was to hold a Strike. Every pony with wealth had to leave Equestria and create their own country where they won't be unnecessarily taxed. It was time to build NEW HAVEN!",0

Bella sat there waiting, watching the clock. The hammering sound of the constant ticking, every second, smoothed her mood as she waited for him to come home. Every strike of the bell came closer and closer for everything her life represented crashed down all around her. Tick, tick, tick went the clock. Every second drew nearer to the end – an end she wasn’t looking forward to. The clock was a grandfather’s clock that her family had inherited. It was rather old and if put on online on some trading website would fetch a good sum of money. With the future she was heading towards, she was going to have to sell that grandfather’s clock.There was a knock on the door. The sound unsettled the constant rhythm given out by the ticking of the clock – beat by beat by beat. After telling him to come in, the door slowly crept open. The door obviously needed to be fixed, but that would most likely be the concern of who lived next in the Godforsaken house. A sleek but skinny pale being slipped through the door, wandered towards where she was sitting, and sat down on the chair facing opposite her. A few years ago his downtrodden face turned her on. His bare chest in front of her, glittering in fall glory, used to make her jump the moon. Even his confident smile used to make her feel safe – knowing that nothing could harm her; no wolf, no crazed vampire, nor thugs and muggers.Now looking at his face made her want to puke. How did she once love such a man like this? Even though he didn’t look an age below seventeen, his cold dark staring looks started to show his age. Bella started to imaginary wrinkles across his face, where they should be for a man his age. Silver white hair started to replace what was his brown spiky stylized hair, and his red beaming eyes became those of a blind beggar, after a day out in the cold Seattle sun. Nothing of him turned her on anymore. She was now eternal unattached to him, like magnets with the same polar charged face directing towards each other and which much strength failing to connect. They were separate once and for all.“It’s over,” she announced, placing the cup of coffee – two spoons of sugar and just a pinch of hot chocolate, just to add that extra punch – and staring into those eyes, those demonized eyes. She knew he had it in him. He could leap out at any moment and pull her to the ground with his strong masculine arms. He could then lower his cursed head, bringing out his fangs to rest upon her neck – the left side, ready to bite deep into her delicate skin. But he didn’t. He stared there for a moment that seemed like an eternity – he lived for so long that he could put up with eternity.“But I thought we were doing so well,” he said simply, bringing out the coffee pot and digging into it with his spoon, dragging out just enough coffee without making the drink too strong. He then advance towards the sugar bowl before continuing, asking the one question Bella was dreading the entire evening: “Please explain. I just don’t understand why?”“It’s because…” she said, before pausing, entering a short moment of silence – an awkward silence as Edward stared at her, eagerly waiting, like a dog being told to wait before it could even dare to eat the food it earned so earnestly from guarding its owner’s house against all sorts of evil, cruel and twisted things, for her reply, “...it’s me, not you.” And cliché reply. She imaginarily hit herself in the knee – how could she use such a lame and unexcitedly excuse.“You are the problem?” the vampire said, puzzlingly. He brushed his hair with his hands, moving it through those thick threads, messing up his hair again – he always loved that un-kept look, it was his favourite and Bella’s as well. “I am a vampire – are you kidding me?”“I’m not!” protested Bella, standing up so that she could stare down at him, creating a tension of authority – her challenging him to rule the roof he used to so bravely and diligently reign over. “We are so different. I’m mortal and you’re not. We aren’t made for each other. And it’s unnatural.”“Unnatural?” said Edward in surprise. “I keep telling you that I could turn you but you keep refusing. How can it be unnatural if you refuse to go halfway on things?”“I told you before,” Bella addressed him again – not the first time though – trying to make sure she was clear on her claims, “I don’t want to be a vampire. I just don’t see each other getting married and living forever happy. I don’t think I can enter such a commitment?”“Don’t talk to me about commitment?” Edward said, his voice now getting angrier and less calm than he usually was. “I pissed everyone off in Italy just for you. Do you refuse to say that was a commitment? I’ve put everything on the line for you.”“How can you commit if we cannot start a family?” she revealed.“You know that a family is impossible between us?” he said, in a sad tone, as if he was regretting the lack of kin he could call children. She could, and she had decided that moment that she would, and will have a family.“That’s why I’m leaving you,” she said as she entered what used to be their bedroom to pack her things up. “Goodbye, my love.” He placed his face into the palms of his hand and wept.",0
"Smithers sat in the dimly-lit interrogation room, his wrists and ankles bound to the chair. He could hear the muffled sounds of his captors outside the door, discussing how best to extract information from him. He was determined not to break, no matter what they did to him. His only thought was to protect Alex at all costs. Suddenly, the door burst open and two burly men entered, ready to begin the interrogation.



As the interrogation began, Smithers struggled to maintain his composure. He could feel the anger and hatred emanating from his captors, and he knew that he was in grave danger. Suddenly, the door to the interrogation room opened and a familiar figure stepped inside. It was Ian Rider, Alex's uncle and a former MI6 agent. Smithers could hardly believe his eyes.











""Ian,"" he said, his voice tight with emotion. ""What are you doing here?"" Ian gave him a cold, hard look. ""I'm here to get answers,"" he said, his voice low and menacing. ""Answers that you're going to give me, one way or another."" Smithers knew that he was in trouble. Ian was a seasoned agent, and he would stop at nothing to extract the information he needed. Smithers braced himself for what was to come.
As Ian and the other interrogators circled around him, Smithers knew that he had no choice but to tell them where Alex was. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. ""He's in Jakarta,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Ian's eyes narrowed. ""What was that?"" he asked, his voice cold and dangerous. ""Speak up.""
Smithers swallowed hard. ""Alex is in Jakarta,"" he repeated, louder this time. ""I don't know where, but he's there.""
Ian's expression softened, and he exchanged a glance with the other interrogators. ""Well, well,"" he said, a cruel smile spreading across his face. ""It seems we have our next target."" He leaned in close to Smithers, his breath hot on his face. ""You just made things a lot easier for us, Smithers. And a lot harder for Alex.""
Alex had been in Jakarta for several days, trying to gather information and lay low. He had been staying in a small hotel in a quiet part of the city, using a fake name and avoiding attracting attention. He had spent his days exploring the city and trying to learn as much as he could about his target, a notorious arms dealer who was believed to be operating in the area.
At night, Alex would return to his hotel and spend hours going over the information he had gathered, trying to piece together a plan. He knew that time was running out, and he needed to act quickly and carefully. He had to find the arms dealer and stop him before he could cause any more damage.
On the morning of the fourth day, Alex was just about to leave his hotel when he heard a knock on the door. He froze, his heart pounding in his chest. Who could it be? Had he been discovered? He crept to the door and peered through the peephole, his hand hovering over his concealed weapon. To his surprise, he saw Smithers standing on the other side, looking haggard and worn. Alex quickly opened the door and pulled him inside. ""Smithers,"" he said, his voice tense with worry. ""What are you doing here? It's not safe for you to be here.""
Smithers collapsed onto the bed, his face pale and drawn. ""I had to come,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I had to warn you.""
Alex's heart sank. ""Warn me about what?"" he asked, his voice tight with fear.
Smithers looked up at him, his eyes filled with regret. ""Ian,"" he said, his voice barely audible. ""Ian Rider. He's here, in Jakarta. He's the one who sent me to find you.""
Alex's mind reeled. Ian Rider was his uncle, a former MI6 agent who had betrayed his country and tried to kill him. He couldn't believe that Ian was in Jakarta, hunting him down. ""How did he find me?"" he asked, his voice strained.
""I don't know,"" Smithers said, his voice heavy with guilt. ""But he knows you're here. He's going to come after you, Alex. You have to get out of here, now.""
Alex knew that Smithers was right. He had to leave, and fast. He quickly gathered his things and threw them into his backpack, his mind racing. ""Where can I go?"" he asked, his voice urgent.
""There's an old safe house in the city,"" Smithers said, his voice strained. ""I can take you there, but we have to hurry. Ian and his men are close behind me, I can feel it.""
Alex nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. ""Okay,"" he said, his voice determined. ""Let's go.""
They left the hotel as quickly and quietly as possible, taking back streets and alleys to avoid being seen. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. He knew that he couldn't stay in Jakarta for much longer, not with Ian on his tail. But where could he go?
As they reached the safe house, Alex's heart sank. It was run-down and abandoned, clearly not used in years. ""This is it?"" he asked, his voice filled with doubt.
""It's the best I could do,"" Smithers said, his voice apologetic. ""It's hidden and secure, at least for now. You can rest here and figure out your next move.""
Alex nodded, his mind racing. He knew that he didn't have much time. He had to come up with a plan, and fast. He sat down on the old, musty couch and began to go over his options. He knew that he couldn't stay in Jakarta, not with Ian and his men closing in. He had to leave, but where could he go?
As he sat there, deep in thought, he heard a noise outside the safe house. It sounded like footsteps, coming closer and closer. Alex's heart pounded in his chest. They had been found. He quickly grabbed his backpack and stood up, his mind racing. He had to get out of there, now.
He turned to Smithers, who was standing by the door, a look of determination on his face. ""Come on,"" Alex said, his voice urgent. ""We have to go.""
Together, they ran out the door and into the streets of Jakarta. They were being pursued, and they knew that they didn't have much time. They had to find a way out of the city, and fast. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. He knew that their only hope was to outsmart Ian and his men, and somehow find a way to safety. But how?
Alex and Smithers ran through the streets of Jakarta, their feet pounding against the pavement. They could hear Ian and his men close behind them, their shouts and footsteps getting louder and louder. Alex's heart pounded in his chest. He knew that they had to get out of the city, and fast.
As they ran, they reached the outskirts of the city, the buildings giving way to fields and forests. They knew that they had to keep moving, to put as much distance between them and Ian as possible. They ran on, their breath coming in gasps and their legs burning with exertion.
Suddenly, they heard a shout from behind them. ""There they are! Over there!"" Alex looked back and saw Ian and his men, pointing and running towards them. They were trapped.
Alex and Smithers looked at each other, their eyes wide with fear and determination. They knew that they had to keep moving, to find a way out of this trap. They ran on, ducking and weaving through the trees and underbrush.
But Ian and his men were gaining on them, their footsteps getting louder and louder. Alex could feel their breath on the back of his neck, and he knew that they were running out of time. He had to come up with a plan, and fast.
As they ran, Alex spotted a small village in the distance. He grabbed Smithers' hand and pulled him towards it. ""Come on,"" he said, his voice urgent. ""We can hide there, maybe find some help.""
They reached the village and ran inside, their feet pounding against the dirt road. They could hear Ian and his men behind them, their shouts getting louder and louder. Alex's heart was pounding in his chest. He knew
that they had to find a place to hide, and fast. He looked around, searching for a place to shelter. Suddenly, he spotted a small, dilapidated building off to the side of the road. ""There,"" he said, pulling Smithers towards it. ""We can hide there.""
They ran to the building and pushed open the door, slipping inside and closing it behind them. They could hear Ian and his men outside, their shouts and footsteps getting closer and closer. Alex's heart was pounding in his chest. He knew that they had to stay quiet, to avoid being found.
They huddled in the corner of the building, their breaths coming in gasps and their hearts pounding in their chests. Alex could feel the fear and adrenaline coursing through his veins, and he knew that he had to stay calm. He looked at Smithers, who was pale and shaken. ""It's okay,"" he said, trying to sound reassuring. ""We'll figure this out, I promise.""
They sat there for what felt like hours, listening to the sounds of Ian and his men outside. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. He knew that they couldn't stay in the building forever, not with Ian and his men searching for them. He had to come up with a way to escape, and fast.
As the sounds outside began to fade, Alex knew that they had to move. He stood up and looked out the window, trying to gauge the situation. He could see Ian and his men in the distance, still searching but starting to lose hope. It was now or never.
He turned to Smithers and grabbed his hand. ""Come on,"" he said, his voice urgent. ""We have to go, now.""
Together, they ran out of the building and into the night. They had to find a way out of the village, to put as much distance between them and Ian as possible. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. He knew that they couldn't run forever, not with Ian and his men on their tail.
Alex and Smithers ran through the night, their feet pounding against the ground. They could hear Ian and his men behind them, their shouts and footsteps getting louder and louder. Alex's heart was pounding in his chest. He knew that they had to find a way out of this, and fast.
As they ran, they reached the edge of the village and came to a stop. In front of them was a dense forest, stretching out as far as the eye could see. Alex looked at Smithers, his eyes filled with fear and determination. ""We have to go in there,"" he said, his voice urgent. ""It's our only chance.""
Smithers nodded, his eyes wide with fear. ""Okay,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Let's go.""
They ran into the forest, their feet crunching on the fallen leaves and branches. The trees loomed over them, dark and foreboding. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. He knew that they couldn't stay in the forest forever, not with Ian and his men on their tail. He had to find a way out, and fast.
As they ran, they heard a noise behind them. It sounded like a branch breaking, followed by a shout. Alex's heart sank. They had been discovered. He grabbed Smithers' hand and pulled him along, his heart pounding in his chest. They had to keep moving, to find a way out of this.





But as they ran, they realized that they were lost. The forest was dark and dense, and they had no idea where they were going. Alex's heart was pounding in his chest. He knew that they had to keep moving, to find a way out before it was too late. But with Ian and his men closing in, their time was running out. Alex's mind was racing, trying to come up with a plan. But with each step, he could feel the fear and desperation growing. How were they going to escape this trap?",0

Harry Potter and Midoriya Izuku were two unlikely friends who met at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry, the famous Boy Who Lived, was in his seventh and final year at Hogwarts, while Izuku, a Quirkless wizard from Japan, was just starting his first year.At first, Harry and Izuku didn't get along. Harry was used to being the center of attention and didn't know how to handle the adoration that Izuku, a huge fan of Harry's, had for him. Izuku, on the other hand, was intimidated by Harry's fame and struggled to make friends.But as the year went on, the two boys found that they had more in common than they thought. Both had faced challenges in their lives and both were determined to overcome them. They began to spend more time together, studying in the library and training for Quidditch.One day, during a particularly fierce Quidditch match, Harry and Izuku found themselves working together to take down the opposing team. Their combined skills proved to be unstoppable, and they led their team to victory.After the match, Harry and Izuku sat on the Quidditch pitch, catching their breath. ""That was amazing,"" Izuku said, grinning at Harry. ""We make a great team.""""We do,"" Harry agreed, smiling back at his friend. ""But we couldn't have done it without your Quirk. You're really talented, Izuku.""""Thanks, Harry,"" Izuku said, his cheeks turning pink with embarrassment. ""But you're the one who taught me how to use my Quirk in a team setting. I wouldn't have been able to do it without you.""The two boys sat in silence for a moment, basking in the glow of their victory. Then Harry spoke up. ""Izuku, I've been thinking. I know you're Quirkless, but that doesn't mean you can't be a great wizard. You have the potential to be one of the greatest wizards of all time, and I want to help you reach that potential. Will you be my apprentice?""Izuku's eyes widened in surprise. ""Harry, are you serious? You want me to be your apprentice?""""I do,"" Harry said, nodding solemnly. ""I believe in you, Izuku. And I know that with hard work and determination, you can achieve anything you set your mind to.""Izuku thought for a moment, his heart racing with excitement. Then he grinned and held out his hand. ""I accept, Harry. I'll be your apprentice and together, we'll become the greatest wizards of all time.""Harry grinned back and shook Izuku's hand, sealing their new partnership. From that day on, Harry and Izuku trained and studied together, learning from each other and growing stronger as they faced new challenges. And as they looked to the future, they knew that nothing could stand in their way.",0

Hermione Granger sat alone in her bedroom, staring at the candle burning on her desk. She had been studying the ancient art of time travel for months, and tonight was the night she would finally attempt the ritual.She had spent countless hours pouring over dusty old books and scrolls, searching for the key to unlocking the secrets of the past. And now, finally, she believed she had found it.She carefully arranged the candles and incense on her desk, and then reached for the ancient book that contained the ritual. She traced her finger over the intricate symbols and runes that covered its pages, her heart pounding with excitement and fear.As she began to read the incantation, the room around her began to shake and shudder. She could feel the power of the ritual building within her, and she knew that this was her one chance to make a difference.Suddenly, there was a blinding flash of light and Hermione was whisked away to another time and place. She found herself standing in an old, decrepit building that she didn't recognize. The only light came from a few flickering candles, and the air was thick with the smell of mold and decay.As she took a step forward, she heard a soft, rasping voice behind her. ""Who are you? How did you get here?""Hermione turned to see a young boy standing in the shadows. He was pale and thin, with dark hair and eyes that seemed to burn with a strange, otherworldly fire. She recognized him immediately as Tom Riddle, the future Dark Lord who would one day become known as Voldemort.Hermione's heart raced as she realized the implications of her situation. She had successfully performed the ritual and traveled back in time, and now she had the power to change the course of history. She could adopt Tom Riddle and raise him to be a good man, or she could abandon him to his fate and let him become the monster he was meant to be.The decision was hers alone, but she knew that whatever she chose would have far-reaching consequences. She was suddenly filled with a sense of purpose and determination, and she knew that she would do whatever it took to save Tom Riddle from his dark destiny.",0

Asuka's eyes were filled with anger and disgust as she sneered at Kaworu.
""You're nothing but a filthy faggot,"" she spat out the words, her voice dripping with malice. ""Stay away from Shinji, you sick freak. He doesn't need someone like you corrupting him with your perverted ways.""
Kaworu's face remained impassive, as if he was unaffected by Asuka's words. ""Your hatred towards me is misplaced, Asuka,"" he said calmly. ""I care for Shinji in a way that you never could. I want what is best for him, and I will not let you or anyone else stand in the way of that.""
""Don't try to justify your disgusting behavior, Kaworu,"" Asuka retorted, her voice rising in anger. ""You're a sick, twisted individual and you have no right to be near Shinji. He deserves better than someone like you.""
""You are the one who is misguided, Asuka,"" Kaworu replied, his voice still calm and measured. ""You are blinded by your own prejudices and cannot see the truth. I will continue to be there for Shinji, regardless of what you say or do.""
Asuka let out a growl of frustration, realizing that she was not getting through to Kaworu. ""Fine,"" she spat out, turning to leave. ""But if you hurt Shinji in any way, I will make sure you pay for it.""
With that, Asuka stormed off, leaving Kaworu standing alone, his expression unreadable. Despite her words, he knew that he would continue to be there for Shinji, no matter what.",0

"“What if our lives were AI-generated?” Nanoha joked heartily to Fate, during a break that they were having. Both women were studying to become professional mages, recognized by the Time-Space Administration Bureau.“Our technology is very developed, Nanoha, but I’m not sure it would understand the depth of our relationship…” Fate explained, while studying her notes for her upcoming Magical Theory exam.“I’ve heard that it will be possible in the future, and that it will be scarily real…” Nanoha said, pouting slightly at Fate’s cold and dismissive answer.Nanoha Takamachi was always a brilliant and talented student. From a young age, she had a natural aptitude for magic, and she excelled in her studies at the mage academy. She consistently ranked at the top of her class and was admired by her peers and teachers for her dedication and commitment to her studies.Nanoha first met Fate Testarossa at the magical academy. As she walked through the halls, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. She had always dreamed of attending a school like this, where she could learn and grow and become the best mage she could be.Turning around a corner and seeing Fate's familiar face, her heart skipped a beat. Fate's poise and calm aura had picked up Nanoha's interest, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of longing to get to know her better. Fate had always inspired Nanoha with her kindness and her strength, and Nanoha was thrilled to have finally met her.As Nanoha approached, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness. She had always been a bit shy and introverted, and she wasn't sure if Fate would have know her. But as she got closer, Fate's face lit up with a smile, and Nanoha knew that she was in good hands.Fate had taken Nanoha's hand and smiled warmly, introducing herself. Nanoha had returned the greeting with a smile, feeling a sense of warmth and happiness. She had had the feeling that she and Fate would always be there for each other, no matter what the future held.Nanoha and Fate graduated from the mage academy and went their separate ways. They were both eager to pursue their dreams and make a difference in the world, and they knew that they would have to work hard to achieve their goals.For a while, they stayed in touch, and they enjoyed catching up with each other and hearing about each other's adventures. However, as the years passed, their schedules became increasingly busy, and it became harder and harder for them to find time to talk.At first, Nanoha tried not to let this bother her. She was proud of Fate and all that she had accomplished, and she was happy to see her friend succeed. However, as the weeks and months turned into years, she began to feel a sense of loss. She missed the camaraderie that they had shared at the mage academy, and she longed to have Fate by her side once again.Despite her sadness, Nanoha knew that she had to let Fate go. She understood that her friend had her own dreams and ambitions, and she didn't want to stand in the way of those. She hoped that one day, they would be able to reconnect and rekindle the friendship that they had once shared, but until then, she knew that she would have to be content with the memories of their time together. This is why, after graduating from the mage academy, Nanoha decided to pursue a career in magic. She joined the Time-Space Administration Bureau, a government organization that worked to protect the world from various magical threats and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming one of the organization's most trusted and respected mages.As she worked to protect the world, Nanoha discovered that she had a passion for teaching. She loved sharing her knowledge and experience with others and enjoyed helping her fellow mages grow and develop their skills. However, becoming a teacher was not easy, and Nanoha had to work hard to achieve her dream. She spent long hours studying and preparing for her exams, and she often had to juggle multiple responsibilities at once.In addition to her academic studies, Nanoha also had to complete practical training in order to become a fully qualified teacher. This involved working with experienced teachers and observing their classes, as well as teaching classes of her own. It was hard work, but Nanoha was determined to succeed, and she put in the extra effort needed to become the best teacher she could be.Despite the challenges she faced, Nanoha never gave up on her dream. She was driven by a fierce determination to succeed, and she knew that with hard work and perseverance, she could achieve anything. However, as Nanoha strived to become a teacher, she couldn't help but think about her loss of relationship with Fate. Despite her best efforts, she had been unable to maintain regular contact with her friend, and she often found herself wondering what Fate was up to and whether she was happy.At times, Nanoha felt a deep sense of loneliness and isolation, as she struggled to balance her studies and work with her personal life. She missed the camaraderie and support that she had once shared with Fate, and she longed for the opportunity to reconnect with her friend.Despite these feelings, Nanoha refused to let her sadness get in the way of her dreams. She was determined to succeed, and she knew that she couldn't afford to let her emotions distract her from her studies. She pushed herself harder than ever, throwing herself into her work and striving to be the best teacher she could be: she was determined to prove to herself and to the world that she was capable of achieving her dreams.And in the end, her efforts paid off, as she was offered a teaching position at the prestigious University of Todai in Japan. She eagerly accepted the opportunity to pursue her dream of becoming a professor. Though she was thrilled to have achieved her dream, she couldn't help but wonder what might have been if she and Fate had been able to stay in touch. She hoped that one day, Fate and she would be able to reconnect and rekindle the bond that they had once shared, but until then, she knew that she would have to be content with the memories of their time together.As Nanoha began her new role at the university, the woman was determined to be the best teacher she could be. She threw herself into her work, developing engaging and informative lesson plans and working hard to inspire her students to reach their full potential. She was dedicated and committed to her work, and she knew that she had found her calling.She was passionate about sharing her knowledge and experience with others, and she wanted to help young mages grow and develop their skills.To make her classes more interactive and hands-on, Nanoha often incorporated various activities and exercises into her lesson plans. She sometimes made her students work in small groups to solve problems or complete challenges, or she had them participate in role-playing exercises or simulations. She also made sure to use a variety of teaching aids, such as multimedia presentations and hands-on demonstrations, to keep her students interested and engaged.Nanoha was also known for her engaging and dynamic teaching style. She was passionate about her subject matter and was always eager to share her knowledge and experience with her students. She was patient and understanding, always willing to help her students when they needed it, and she was strict when she needed to be, making sure that her students remained focused and on track.Her students admired Nanoha for her dedication and commitment to their education. They appreciated her engaging and interactive teaching style and the way she made learning fun and enjoyable. They knew that she was always there for them, and they were grateful to have her as their teacher.Nanoha's involvement with the education of her students earned her the respect and admiration of her colleagues and superiors. She was known as an exceptional teacher and was frequently praised for her ability to inspire and motivate her students.As she continued to teach at the university, Nanoha found that she was constantly learning and growing as a person. She loved the intellectual challenges and the opportunity to engage with her students and share her knowledge with them. She knew that she had found her calling, and she was grateful to be able to make a positive impact on the lives of her students.As Nanoha's career was blossoming, she couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. She had worked hard to achieve her dream, and she was thrilled to finally be able to share her knowledge and experience with her students.She remained one of the most popular and respected teachers at the university, as she was always willing to go the extra mile to help her students succeed. She took great joy in watching them grow and develop their skills.Despite her busy schedule, Nanoha never forgot about Fate. She often found herself thinking about her friend and wondering what she was up to. She hoped that one day, they would be able to reconnect and rekindle the bond that they had once shared.And then, one day, that wish finally came true. As Nanoha was walking through the campus, she saw a familiar face approaching her. It was Fate, looking older but just as beautiful and poised as ever. As Fate approached, Nanoha's heart skipped a beat, and she felt a surge of emotion wash over her. She couldn't believe that her friend was actually there, standing in front of her after all these years.At first, Fate didn't seem to recognize Nanoha, and she looked at her with a mixture of curiosity and confusion. But as she got closer, something seemed to click, and her face lit up with recognition.""Nanoha!"" she exclaimed, her voice filled with joy and surprise. ""Is that really you?""Nanoha nodded, tears of happiness welling up in her eyes. ""Yes, it's me,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""I can't believe you're actually here.""Fate reached out and hugged Nanoha tightly, and the two women clung to each other, overwhelmed by the sudden reunion. They had been apart for so long, and it felt like a dream come true to be together again.""I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you right away,"" Fate said, pulling back to look at Nanoha. ""It's just been so long, and you look so different.""Nanoha laughed and wiped away her tears. ""It's okay,"" she said. ""I understand. And you look amazing, by the way. What have you been up to all these years?""Fate shrugged and smiled. ""Oh, you know, just the usual. Working, traveling, trying to save the world.""Nanoha raised an eyebrow. ""Trying to save the world? What do you mean?""Fate grinned. ""Well, I'm not sure if you've heard, but I've been working as an investigator for the Time-Space Administration Bureau. We deal with all sorts of magical threats and disturbances, and it's been quite an adventure.""Nanoha's eyes widened in surprise. ""An investigator? That's amazing, Fate! I'm so proud of you.""Fate blushed and looked away, clearly embarrassed by the compliment. ""Thanks,"" she said. ""I'm just glad to be doing something useful. And speaking of which, I should probably get back to work. I'm just here for a quick visit, but I'm glad I got to see you.""Nanoha nodded, feeling a sense of sadness and longing wash over her. She didn't want to let Fate go again, but she knew that her friend had important work to do.""I understand,"" she said, forcing a smile. ""It was great seeing you, Fate. Take care of yourself, okay?""Fate nodded and hugged Nanoha one last time. ""I will,"" she said. ""And you take care of yourself too, okay? We'll catch up again soon, I promise.""And with that, Fate turned and walked away, leaving Nanoha standing there with a mixture of a heavy heart and a sense of hope. She watched as Fate disappeared into the crowds of students, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of longing and sadness.But at the same time, she also felt a glimmer of hope. Fate was alive and well, and she was making a difference in the world. That was something to be proud of, and it filled Nanoha with a sense of happiness and joy.As she turned and walked back to her classroom, Nanoha couldn't help but smile. She had a feeling that this wasn't the last time she would see Fate, and she was determined to make the most of their time together. She knew that their friendship was something special, and she was determined to hold onto it with all her might.And as she walked through the doors of the university, she knew that no matter what the future held, she and Fate would always be there for each other. Over the next few weeks, Nanoha and Fate spent as much time together as they could, catching up on all the years they had missed. They went out to dinner and took long walks around the city, reminiscing about their time at the mage academy and all the adventures they had shared.They laughed and cried and hugged each other tightly, grateful to be reunited after so long apart. And as they spent more and more time together, they began to realize that the bond they had once shared was still just as strong as ever.As they spent more time together, Nanoha and Fate also began to realize that their feelings for each other had changed. They had always been close friends, but now, they found themselves feeling something more. They were drawn to each other in a way that they couldn't explain, and they couldn't deny the feelings that were growing inside of them.At first, they were both hesitant to act on their feelings. They had always been just friends, and they were afraid of ruining what they had. But in the end, they couldn't resist the pull of their hearts, and they knew that they had to take the chance.So one night, as they sat together on a bench overlooking the city, Nanoha turned to Fate and took her hand. ""Fate,"" she said, her voice filled with emotion. ""I have something to tell you. I know we've always been just friends, but I think I have feelings for you. More than just friendship. I don't know what it means, but I just had to tell you.""Fate looked at Nanoha with tears in her eyes. ""Nanoha,"" she said, her voice trembling. ""I feel the same way. I've always cared about you, but lately, I've been feeling something more. I don't know what it means either, but I'm willing to find out.""And with that, they leaned in and kissed each other softly, finally giving in to the feelings that they had both been denying for so long. As they embraced, they knew that their lives had changed forever, and that they would always be there for each other, no matter what the future held.From there on, Nanoha and Fate's relationship flourished. They were no longer just friends, but a couple, bound together by their love and their commitment to each other. They spent every moment they could together, exploring the city and enjoying each other's company.They also continued to work together, using their combined skills and abilities to protect the world from all sorts of magical threats. They became one of the most respected and admired magical couples in the world, known for their bravery and their dedication to the greater good.One of their notable missions took place when they were called upon to investigate a series of strange occurrences in a small village in the countryside. At first, the case seemed simple enough, but as they delved deeper, they realized that they were dealing with a powerful and dangerous mage who had been summoning dark forces to do their bidding.As the battle raged on, Nanoha and Fate found themselves pushed to the brink. They were exhausted and injured, and they knew that one wrong move could mean the end. But they refused to give up. They fought on, using every ounce of strength and skill they had to overcome their opponents.In the end, they emerged victorious, but not without cost. They had saved countless lives and protected the world from a terrible fate, but they had also suffered injuries and losses that would haunt them for the rest of their lives. As they left the mages' hideout behind, they knew that they had done what was necessary, but they couldn't shake the feeling that they had paid a steep price for their victory.Another notable mission that Nanoha and Fate performed together involved a dangerous magical artifact that had fallen into the wrong hands. The artifact had the power to destroy entire cities, and it was being held by a group of rogue mages who were threatening to use it unless their demands were met.Nanoha and Fate were tasked with retrieving the artifact and neutralizing the threat. They knew that the mission would be risky, but they were determined to do whatever it took to protect the world.As Nanoha and Fate approached the mages' hideout, they couldn't shake the feeling of foreboding that weighed on them. They knew that the mission ahead would be dangerous, and they were well aware of the risks they were taking.As they made their way through the dark, twisting corridors of the hideout, they encountered numerous challenges and obstacles. They fought their way through hordes of powerful magical creatures, using their magic to cut a path through the enemy ranks. They also had to navigate treacherous traps and puzzles, using their quick wits and skills to avoid danger.But the biggest challenge came when they faced the rogue mages themselves. These powerful and dangerous opponents were determined to keep the artifact for themselves, and they were willing to do whatever it took to stop Nanoha and Fate from taking it.As the battle raged on, Nanoha and Fate found themselves pushed to their limits. They were exhausted and injured, their bodies battered and bruised from the constant fighting. They knew that they were running on borrowed time, and that one wrong move could mean the end.But they refused to give up. They were resolved to protect the world, no matter what the cost. They fought on, using every ounce of strength and skill they had to overcome their opponents. They were driven by a fierce determination to succeed, and they knew that they couldn't let the world down.As they battled on, the stakes only grew higher. The rogue mages were relentless, using every trick and tactic at their disposal to try and defeat Nanoha and Fate. But the two mages were equally resolved, and they fought on with a fierce resolve.In the end, the outcome was uncertain. Both sides were battered and bruised, and it was anyone's guess who would emerge victorious. But Nanoha and Fate were determined to succeed, and they fought on with all the strength and skill they had left, resolved to protect the world.In the end, Nanoha and Fate emerged victorious, but not without cost. They had saved countless lives and protected the world from a terrible fate, but they had also suffered injuries and losses that would haunt them for the rest of their lives.As they left the mages' lair behind, they were battered and bruised, their bodies battered and broken from the intense fighting. They had faced unimaginable challenges and overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles, but they had done so at great personal cost.They knew that they had done what was necessary, but they couldn't shake the feeling that they had paid a steep price for their victory. They had lost friends and allies in the battle, and they carried the weight of their sacrifices with them as they left the mages' lair behind.They also knew that their victory was only temporary. The world was a dangerous place, and they knew that they would face more challenges and dangers in the future. But they were ready for whatever came their way, and they knew that they would face the future together, united in their determination to protect the world and those they loved.But despite the hardships they faced, Nanoha and Fate remained determined and resilient. They knew that they had each other, and that was all that mattered. Together, they would face any challenge that came their way, and they would emerge stronger and more united than ever. And as they walked hand in hand into the future, they knew that they would always be there for each other, no matter what the world had in store.This mission was a turning point in Nanoha and Fate's lives. It was a defining moment that tested their strength and determination, and it helped to forge a bond between them that would last a lifetime.In the years that followed, Nanoha and Fate continued to work together to protect the world from various magical threats. They faced numerous challenges and dangers, but they always stood by each other's side, united in their determination to do what was necessary to keep the world safe.As they worked together, their bond only grew stronger. They learned to rely on each other and trust in each other's abilities, and they became one of the most respected and admired magical couples in the world.Nanoha continued her work as a teacher at the University of Todai, where she was beloved by her students. She maintained her willingness to go above and beyond to help her students succeed, and she took great joy in watching them grow and develop their skills.Fate, meanwhile, continued her work as an investigator for the Time-Space Administration Bureau. She was known for her bravery and her ability to solve even the most complex and dangerous cases. She traveled all over the world, working to protect the innocent and bring justice to those who threatened the safety of the world.Despite the demands of their respective careers, Nanoha and Fate made sure to always make time for each other. They knew that their love was the most important thing in their lives, and they were determined to keep it alive and strong.And as they faced each new day together, they knew that no matter what the future held, they would always be there for each other, through thick and thin, through good times and bad.Being a couple in the magical world was not without its challenges. As Nanoha and Fate worked to protect the world from danger, they often found themselves facing long separations and intense pressure. They were constantly juggling their careers, their relationships, and their responsibilities, and it was not always easy to find a balance.But they were determined to make it work, and they were committed to supporting each other through everything. They knew that their love was strong enough to withstand any obstacle, and they were determined to keep it alive and thriving.They made sure to set aside time for each other, even in the busiest of times. They would go out on dates, take long walks, and spend quiet evenings together, just enjoying each other's company. They also made sure to keep each other informed of their work and their lives, always staying connected and in touch, no matter how far apart they might be.And when they faced difficult times, they were there for each other, offering comfort, support, and love. They knew that they were stronger together than they were apart, and they were determined to make the most of every moment they had together.Through it all, Nanoha and Fate remained deeply in love, and they knew that their bond would always be there, no matter what the world had in store.",0

""I don't understand how you could possibly think Twilight Sparkle is the best My Little Pony character. She's too uptight, always worrying about rules and regulations. It's Rainbow Dash who truly embodies the spirit of friendship and adventure.""Jesse Pinkman rolled his eyes, his own arms crossed in defiance. ""Are you kidding me, Mr. White? Rainbow Dash may be cool, but Twilight Sparkle is the one who actually knows how to use her magic for good. She's the brains of the operation.""Walter let out a huff of annoyance. ""Brains? You call being a rule-following, uptight know-it-all using your brains? That's not using your brains, that's just being a stick in the mud.""Jesse let out a groan of frustration. ""Dude, you are seriously missing the point. Twilight Sparkle may not be as cool as Rainbow Dash, but she's the one who actually gets things done. She's the glue that holds the group together.""Walter let out a sarcastic snort. ""The glue? Please. It's Pinkie Pie who is the real glue. Without her, the group would fall apart. She's the one who keeps things fun and light-hearted.""Jesse's eyes narrowed. ""You can't be serious. Pinkie Pie is just a silly party animal. She doesn't contribute anything meaningful to the group.""Walter's temper flared. ""Silly party animal? Pinkie Pie may not be as serious as Twilight Sparkle, but she brings joy and laughter to everyone around her. That's something that can't be measured in brainpower or magic.""Jesse threw his hands up in defeat. ""Fine, Mr. White. You can have your Pinkie Pie. I'll stick with Twilight Sparkle as the best My Little Pony character.""Walter smirked triumphantly. ""I knew you'd come around to my way of thinking.""",0

"in the voice of Benoit Blanc:
I must say, this case has truly been a puzzle. When we were first informed of the alleged harassment of Miss Thunberg, we had little to go on. But as with all cases, we must start somewhere, and in this instance, it was a rather curious pizza box that caught my eye.You see, Mr. Tate had created a video in which he boasted about his actions and taunted Miss Thunberg. It was a most distasteful display, to be sure. But as I watched the video, I noticed something in the background - a pizza box with the logo of a local pizzeria.Now, this may seem like a small detail, but in my experience, it is often the small details that lead to the biggest breakthroughs. And so, I made a note of the pizzeria and instructed my team to pay them a visit.As it turns out, the staff at the pizzeria were able to provide us with valuable information about Mr. Tate's recent orders and his potential whereabouts. And with this information in hand, we were able to track Mr. Tate down and make the arrest.So, you see, it was the pizza box that proved to be the key piece of evidence in this case. It may seem insignificant, but it was the clue that led us to the perpetrator. And that, my dear friends, is the power of observation and attention to detail.",0

 > write me a fanfiction where Bella Swan from Twilight shunned Edward Cullen in favor of a Herman Miller chair 






Bella Swan had always been a practical person. She valued comfort and efficiency above all else, and that's why she had fallen in love with her Herman Miller chair. It was sleek, stylish, and most importantly, it provided the perfect level of support for her back.


As she sat in her chair, staring out at the rainy Forks sky, Bella couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. She had always been drawn to the mysterious and brooding Edward Cullen, but she knew deep down that he could never compare to the comfort and reliability of her chair.


So, when Edward came to her with his usual declarations of love and devotion, Bella made the difficult decision to turn him down. She knew it would be hard, but she also knew it was the right thing to do.


""I'm sorry, Edward,"" Bella said, her voice soft but firm. ""I care about you deeply, but I just can't be with you. You see, I've fallen in love with someone else.""


Edward's eyes widened in shock and hurt. ""Who is it?"" he demanded.


Bella smiled and gestured to her chair. ""It's my Herman Miller. It's always there for me, supporting me and making me comfortable. I can't turn my back on that kind of love.""


Edward was heartbroken, but he knew that Bella had made her decision. He left, vowing to move on and find someone who could appreciate him as much as Bella did her chair.


As for Bella, she settled into her Herman Miller and watched the rain, content in the knowledge that she had made the right choice for herself. She knew that true love came in many forms, and for her, it came in the form of a comfortable and stylish chair.

"Once upon a time, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there were two professors who couldn't stand each other. Draco Malfoy was the new professor of Dark Arts and Hermione Granger was the Head of the Department of Magical Creatures. Both were accomplished wizards in their own right, but their paths had never crossed until they were brought together at Hogwarts.Draco had always been a bit of a rebel, and his unorthodox teaching methods often clashed with Hermione's more traditional approach. He would often skip class and leave his students unsupervised, while Hermione was always on top of her game, making sure that her students were safe and well-informed.Despite their differences, both Draco and Hermione were highly respected by their colleagues and students. However, the two of them could not stand the sight of each other. They would constantly bicker and argue, much to the amusement of the students and the dismay of the other professors.One day, a group of mischievous students decided to play a prank on the two professors by locking them in a storage room together. At first, they continued to argue and insult each other, but as the hours passed, they began to run out of things to say. They were forced to talk to each other and soon they realized that they had more in common than they had thought.As they spent more time together, they began to understand each other's perspectives and found that they had a mutual respect for each other. They also discovered that they had a lot of similar interests and hobbies. Draco was an accomplished wizard, but he had a passion for ancient magic, and Hermione was a brilliant witch, but she had a love for magical creatures.Their friendship continued to grow, and soon they were spending all of their free time together. They would often go on adventures, exploring the castle and the surrounding areas. They would also spend hours discussing magic, and Draco would even ask Hermione for advice on how to improve his teaching.It wasn't long before their friendship turned into something more. They realized that they had feelings for each other and they finally confessed their love to each other. They started dating and it was a big surprise for the students and the other professors. They were happy together and they made a great team, both in the classroom and out of it.Years went by and Draco and Hermione were still together. They both retired from teaching and they decided to open a magical creature sanctuary together. They lived happily ever after.They realized that their initial hate for each other was due to the judgments they made from their past experiences and prejudices, but they both were able to look beyond that and appreciate each other for who they truly were. They taught their students, and also themselves, that true love can come from unexpected places, and it is never too late to change the way we see things and people.",0
"Tom Riddle sat in the small, sterile room, his eyes cold and calculating as he watched Ginny Weasley enter. She was his new psychiatrist, assigned to him after his previous doctor had quit due to his manipulative and dangerous behavior.Ginny had been an Auror before becoming a psychiatrist, and she knew how to handle dangerous criminals. But she was not prepared for the level of manipulation and psychopathy that Tom possessed.""Good morning, Mr. Riddle,"" Ginny said, her voice steady and professional. ""I'm here to help you.""Tom smiled, his eyes gleaming with a sinister light. ""I don't need your help, Dr. Weasley. I'm perfectly fine on my own.""Ginny sat down across from him, her notebook open and pen at the ready. ""I disagree. You've been diagnosed with severe narcissistic personality disorder and a tendency towards violence. I'm here to help you understand and manage those tendencies.""Tom leaned back in his chair, his smile never faltering. ""You think you can control me, Dr. Weasley? You think you can manipulate me like all the others? I assure you, you can't.""Ginny met his gaze, her own steady and unafraid. ""I am not here to control or manipulate you, Mr. Riddle. I am here to help you understand yourself and your actions, and to teach you how to control your own behavior.""But as the sessions went on, Ginny began to realize that Tom was beyond help. He was too far gone, too consumed by his own twisted desires and needs. He would never change, never be anything other than a dangerous and manipulative psychopath.Despite this, Ginny refused to give up on him. She continued to push him to understand himself, to take responsibility for his actions, and to try to change. And though he never truly changed, she at least made him think about his actions and the consequences they had.As Ginny sat in her office, staring at Tom's file, she couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness for the boy he had once been and the monster he had become. But she knew that she had done all she could for him, and that was all that mattered.As time went on, Tom grew more and more frustrated with Ginny's constant pushing and prodding. He couldn't stand the fact that she was able to see through his manipulations and lies, and that she refused to be swayed by his charms.He began to see her as a challenge, a puzzle to be solved, and he became obsessed with breaking her down and making her see things his way.Ginny, however, was not so easily broken. She had seen too many criminals and psychopaths in her time as an Auror, and she knew how to handle someone like Tom.But Tom was unlike anyone she had ever dealt with before. He was intelligent, charismatic, and utterly without a conscience. He was a master manipulator, and he knew how to play people like a violin.Despite this, Ginny never gave up on him. She continued to push him to take responsibility for his actions, to understand the consequences of his choices, and to try to change his ways.And though he never truly changed, Ginny could see the smallest glimmers of hope in him. He would sometimes hesitate before making a cruel or manipulative choice, and he would sometimes express remorse for his actions.It was a small victory, but it was enough for Ginny. She knew that she could never fully change Tom, but she had at least made him think about the consequences of his actions, and she had given him the chance to change.In the end, that was all she could do. She could only hope that one day, Tom would take that chance and become a better person.As Ginny continued to work with Tom, she noticed that he was becoming more and more obsessed with her. He would constantly try to find ways to manipulate her and get her to see things his way. He would try to charm her and seduce her, but she was always able to resist his advances.Ginny knew that she had to be careful around Tom, as he was a dangerous and unpredictable individual. She made sure to always have a guard present during their sessions and to never let her guard down around him.Despite the danger, Ginny couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards Tom. She had spent so much time working with him and trying to help him that she couldn't just give up on him.As their sessions continued, Ginny began to notice a change in Tom. He was becoming more and more unstable, his anger and violence becoming more unpredictable. He would lash out at her during their sessions, and she could see the darkness in his eyes.Ginny knew that she had to be careful, as Tom was becoming more and more dangerous. She started to worry that he would harm himself or others, and she knew that she had to do something before it was too late.She contacted Tom's probation officer and they decided to put him in a more secure facility where he could receive the help he needed.Tom was furious when he found out about the transfer. He felt like Ginny had betrayed him, that she had given up on him just like everyone else.But Ginny knew that it was for the best, for both him and for herself. She couldn't keep working with him, as it was becoming too dangerous.As Tom was transferred to the new facility, Ginny couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and loss. She had grown to care for him, despite his flaws and his dangerous nature.But she knew that it was for the best, and she couldn't keep putting herself and others at risk for the sake of trying to help him.Years passed, Ginny went on with her career as a psychiatrist and have other patients. She sometimes wondered about Tom, about what happened to him after he was transferred. She knew that she would never know the full story, but she hoped that he had found the help and understanding that he needed.She knew that she had done all she could for him, and that was all that mattered.As the years passed, Ginny's thoughts of Tom gradually faded. She had other patients to focus on, and her work kept her busy. But every now and then, she would think back on their time together and wonder how he was doing.One day, Ginny received a letter in the mail. It was from Tom. She was surprised and a little uneasy as she opened it.In the letter, Tom thanked her for all she had done for him. He wrote that the time they had spent together had made him realize the error of his ways and that he had been working hard to change. He had gotten therapy, and he had been working on controlling his anger and his manipulative tendencies.Ginny was shocked and touched by the letter. She had never expected to hear from Tom again, and she couldn't believe that he had made such a drastic change.She wrote back to him, telling him that she was happy to hear that he was doing well and that she was proud of him for taking responsibility for his actions and working to change.Over the next few months, Ginny and Tom continued to correspond. He wrote to her about his progress and the challenges he faced, and she offered him words of encouragement and advice.It was clear that Tom had made a tremendous effort to change, and Ginny was proud of him for taking the steps necessary to become a better person.Years later, Ginny retired from her practice and decided to move to the countryside with her husband and children. One day, she received a visit from Tom. He had been released from the facility and wanted to thank her in person for all she had done for him.Ginny was overjoyed to see him and was amazed at the change in him. He was a kinder, more thoughtful person, and she could see that he had truly changed.They sat and talked for hours, reminiscing about the past and catching up on the years that had passed. Ginny was happy to see that Tom had found a new life, and she knew that she had played a small part in helping him get there.In the end, Ginny knew that she had done all she could for Tom, and she was proud of the man he had become. She knew that their paths would never cross again, but she was happy to have been a part of his journey and to have helped him become the person he was meant to be.As Tom left Ginny's home, he felt a sense of closure and gratitude. He had been unsure of how Ginny would react to seeing him again, but her warm reception had put him at ease.He knew that he had a long way to go on his journey of self-improvement, but seeing Ginny again had reminded him of how far he had come.Ginny's guidance and support had been instrumental in helping him turn his life around. He knew that he would never forget the lessons she had taught him, and he would always be grateful for the role she had played in his life.Tom went on to live a productive and meaningful life, using the skills and insights he had gained during his therapy to help others who were struggling with similar issues.He became a therapist himself, dedicating his life to helping others overcome their struggles and find inner peace.Ginny, meanwhile, had the satisfaction of knowing that she had played a small but significant role in Tom's journey. She had helped him see the error of his ways and had given him the tools he needed to change.And in doing so, she had not only changed Tom's life, but she had also changed the lives of countless others whom he went on to help.Years later, Ginny passed away in her sleep, surrounded by her loving family. On her deathbed, she had no regrets, knowing that she had lived a fulfilling life and had made a difference in the world.Tom, who had heard of Ginny's passing, attended her funeral and gave a speech about how much she had meant to him and how she had changed his life forever. He knew that he would always remember her as his savior and his guide on his journey to become a better person.And as he walked away from her grave, he knew that Ginny's legacy would live on through the lives of all those she had helped, including him.As the years passed, Tom became a well-respected therapist, known for his compassion and understanding towards his patients. He often thought back on his time with Ginny, and the lessons she had taught him. He made sure to always pass on her wisdom to his patients, and to use the skills she had taught him to help them overcome their struggles, just as she had helped him.Tom never forgot the debt he owed to Ginny, and he made sure to always honor her memory. He would often visit her grave and leave flowers, and would talk to her as if she were still there, sharing with her the progress of his patients and the difference he was making in their lives.Years passed and Tom retired, but he continued to mentor young therapist and sharing his experience. He also wrote a book about his journey and how Ginny had changed his life and how her teachings had influenced his work as a therapist. The book was a bestseller and helped many people understand the power of therapy and the impact a good therapist can have on a person's life.Tom also established a scholarship in Ginny's honor, to help young therapists afford the education they needed to become licensed and help others in the same way Ginny had helped him.As Tom grew older, he knew that his time on earth was coming to an end. But he had no regrets, knowing that he had lived a fulfilling life and had made a difference in the world, just as Ginny had wanted him to.On his deathbed, he looked back on his life with a sense of peace and contentment. He knew that he had honored Ginny's memory and had used the lessons she had taught him to help others.And as he closed his eyes for the final time, he knew that Ginny would always be with him, guiding him on his journey even in death.",0

"“Anna, what’s wrong?” Elsa asked as she climbed into bed next to her sister.Anna sighed and turned to face Elsa. “I had a really weird dream last night,” she said. “I saw you with another woman.”Elsa chuckled and wrapped an arm around Anna’s shoulders. “It was just a dream, Anna,” she said. “You don’t have to worry about me being with anyone else.”Anna nodded, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that the dream meant something. “I know it was just a dream,” she said. “But it felt so real. And now I can’t stop thinking about it.”Elsa squeezed Anna’s hand and smiled softly. “I had a dream last night too,” she said. “And I have to admit, it was a little bit more pleasant than yours.”Anna’s eyes widened with interest. “What was your dream about?” she asked.“Well,” Elsa began, “I was in this beautiful garden, surrounded by flowers and trees. And I was holding hands with a woman I had never seen before. She was kind and gentle, and I felt this deep sense of love and connection with her.”Anna’s heart skipped a beat as she listened to Elsa’s dream. “What did she look like?” she asked.Elsa closed her eyes and thought for a moment. “She had long, flowing hair, and sparkling eyes,” she said. “And she had the most gentle smile. She also had a unique smell, like a mixture of flowers and spices.”Anna’s mind was racing with possibilities. Could this woman from Elsa’s dream be real? Could she be the one causing Anna to feel so jealous and insecure?“We have to find her,” Anna said determinedly. “We have to see if she’s real.”Elsa raised an eyebrow. “Find her? Anna, she’s just a dream,” she said.“But what if she’s not?” Anna persisted. “What if she’s out there somewhere, waiting for us to find her? We have to at least try.”Elsa hesitated for a moment, but she could see the determination in Anna’s eyes. She knew that there was no way she could talk her out of it.“Fine,” she said with a sigh. “We’ll go into town tomorrow and see if we can find this mysterious woman.”Anna smiled and kissed Elsa on the cheek. “Thank you,” she said. “I know this is probably a long shot, but I just can’t shake the feeling that she’s out there somewhere.”The next morning, Elsa and Anna set off for the city of Arendelle. They asked everyone they saw if they had seen a woman fitting the description of the one from Elsa’s dream, but no one seemed to know who they were talking about.As the day wore on, Anna began to feel more and more discouraged. “Maybe we should just give up,” she said to Elsa. “It’s starting to feel like we’re never going to find her.”Elsa put her arm around Anna and gave her a reassuring squeeze. “We can’t give up yet,” she said. “I know in my heart that she’s out there somewhere, and I won’t give up until we find her.”Anna sighed and nodded, determined to keep looking. She knew that Elsa was right - they couldn’t give up just yet.Just when they were about to call it a day, they heard someone calling out to them. They turned around and saw a woman walking towards them, her long hair flowing behind her.“Elsa?”As the woman approached, Elsa and Anna could see that she was the woman from Elsa’s dream. She had long, flowing hair, sparkling eyes, and a gentle smile, and she smelled like a mixture of flowers and spices.“I’m Honeymaren,” the woman said as she reached out to shake their hands. “I had a dream about you two last night. I saw two beautiful sisters who were searching for me, and I knew I had to find you.”Elsa and Anna were speechless as they listened to Honeymaren’s words. They couldn’t believe that they had finally found the woman from Elsa’s dream.“My wish came true! We can’t believe it,” Anna said, her voice shaking with excitement. “We’ve been looking for you all day.”Honeymaren chuckled and patted Anna on the shoulder. “Well, it looks like our dreams brought us together,” she said. “I’m so glad I was able to find you.”As they walked back to the castle, Elsa and Anna couldn’t stop talking to Honeymaren. They wanted to know everything about her - where she was from, what she liked to do, and how she came to be in Arendelle.Honeymaren told them that she was from a small village on the outskirts of the kingdom, and that she had always had a special connection to nature. She loved spending time in the woods, exploring and learning about the different plants and animals that lived there.As they reached the castle gates, Elsa and Anna invited Honeymaren to join them for lunch. Honeymaren gratefully accepted, and the three of them sat down to a meal of roast chicken, potatoes, and vegetables.As they ate, Elsa and Anna couldn’t help but notice the way Honeymaren looked at them. There was a sparkle in her eyes, a hint of mischief in her smile, and a warmth in her touch that made their hearts race.After lunch, Elsa and Anna showed Honeymaren around the castle, taking her to their favorite rooms and gardens. They laughed and talked and played, feeling a deep sense of connection with her.As the day came to a close, Elsa and Anna knew that they had found something special in Honeymaren. She was kind, caring, and understanding, and they felt a deep sense of love and appreciation for her.But as the night wore on, Elsa and Anna also couldn’t help but notice the way Anna was looking at Honeymaren. There was a sparkle in her eyes, a hint of mischief in her smile, and a warmth in her touch that made Elsa’s heart race.As they sat on the balcony, watching the stars twinkling in the sky, Anna leaned in and kissed Honeymaren on the lips. Elsa’s heart sank as she watched them, feeling a deep sense of jealousy and hurt.Anna closed her eyes and sighed happily as she kissed Honeymaren, feeling her soft and plump lips pressed against hers. She couldn’t help but feel a surge of desire as she tasted the sweetness of Honeymaren’s mouth, and felt the warmth of her breath on her skin.As Anna’s lips explored Honeymaren’s, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of excitement and longing. She had never felt this way before, and she knew that this was something special.But as Anna pulled away, she could see the hurt and jealousy in Elsa’s eyes. She knew that she had made a mistake, and she felt guilty and ashamed.“I’m sorry, Elsa,” Anna said, her voice shaking with emotion. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just couldn’t help myself.”Elsa sighed and looked away, feeling confused and hurt. She didn’t know what to do or how to react.But as she sat there, feeling lost and alone, Anna came to her and wrapped her arms around her. “I love you, Elsa,” she whispered. “I’m sorry if I hurt you. You are the love of my life, and I will always be here for you.”Elsa’s heart warmed as she listened to Anna’s words. She knew that Anna loved her, and that she had made a mistake. And as she wrapped her arms around Anna and hugged her tight, Elsa knew that everything was going to be okay.“I love you too, Anna,” she said. “I’m sorry if I was jealous. I know that you love me, and I will always be here for you.”Anna smiled and snuggled closer to Elsa. “I’m glad we’re okay,” she said. “I don’t know what I would do without you.”Elsa leaned in and pressed her lips against Anna’s, feeling a surge of love and desire. As she deeply kissed Anna, she felt her soft and full lips pressed against hers, and she couldn’t help but feel a sense of joy and happiness.Anna closed her eyes and sighed happily as she kissed Elsa, feeling her strong and confident lips pressed against hers. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of longing and need as she tasted the sweetness of Elsa’s mouth, and felt the warmth of her breath on her skin.As Elsa and Anna kissed, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of love and happiness. They knew that they had found something special in each other, and they knew that they would always be there for each other, no matter what.And as they lay in bed that night, wrapped in each other’s arms, they knew that they had found their happily ever after.The next morning, Elsa and Anna woke up feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. They had spent the night wrapped in each other’s arms, dreaming of all the adventures they would have together.As they got dressed and prepared for the day, they couldn’t help but think of Honeymaren. She had made such an impact on their lives, and they knew that they would always remember her.“I hope Honeymaren is okay,” Anna said as she brushed her hair. “I feel like we just left her hanging.”Elsa put her arm around Anna and gave her a reassuring squeeze. “I’m sure Honeymaren is fine,” she said. “She’s a strong and independent woman, and I’m sure she has a lot going on in her own life.”Anna nodded, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that they had abandoned Honeymaren. She knew that Elsa was right, but she couldn’t help feeling guilty.“Maybe we should go visit her,” Anna said. “Just to make sure she’s okay.”Elsa smiled and kissed Anna on the forehead. “I think that’s a great idea,” she said. “I’m sure Honeymaren would appreciate a visit from us.”So, Elsa and Anna set off for Honeymaren’s village, determined to check on her and make sure she was doing well. They packed a basket of food and supplies, and set off on horseback, eager to see their dear friend.As they rode through the countryside, Elsa and Anna couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the landscape. The rolling hills, the verdant forests, the sparkling streams - all of it was breathtaking.They arrived in Honeymaren’s village late in the afternoon, and they were greeted by a warm and welcoming community. Everyone seemed to know Honeymaren, and they all spoke of her with admiration and respect.As they walked through the village, Elsa and Anna couldn’t help but notice the way people looked at them. There was a hint of jealousy in their eyes, a hint of longing in their smiles. They knew that Elsa and Anna were a couple, and they couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to have someone to share their lives with.Finally, they arrived at Honeymaren’s house, a cozy little cottage nestled in the woods. They knocked on the door, and a moment later, Honeymaren appeared.“Elsa, Anna!” Honeymaren exclaimed as she threw her arms around them. “I’m so glad you came to visit.”Elsa and Anna smiled and hugged her back, feeling a warmth and comfort that only Honeymaren could provide.As they sat down to tea and cookies, Elsa and Anna told Honeymaren about their adventures in the city, and about their love for each other. Honeymaren listened intently, her eyes sparkling with joy and admiration.“I’m so happy for you two,” she said. “You deserve all the love and happiness in the world.”Elsa and Anna blushed and thanked Honeymaren, feeling grateful and blessed to have such a kind and understanding friend.As the evening drew to a close, Elsa and Anna knew that it was time to say goodbye to Honeymaren. They hugged her tightly, promising to visit again soon, and then set off for home.As they rode back to the castle, Elsa and Anna couldn’t help but feel a sense of sadness and loss. They knew that Honeymaren was not meant to be a permanent part of their lives, but they also knew that she would always hold a special place in their hearts.But as they rode back to the castle, Elsa and Anna also couldn’t help but feel a sense of gratitude and happiness. They had each other, and that was all they needed. They had a love that was strong and true, and they knew that they could face any challenge together.As they reached the castle gates, Elsa and Anna dismounted their horses and walked hand in hand through the gardens. They stopped to smell the flowers, listen to the birds singing, and feel the warmth of the sun on their faces.And as they lay in bed that night, Elsa turned to Anna and said, “I love you, Anna. You are my everything, and I will always be here for you.”Anna smiled and snuggled closer to Elsa. “I love you too, Elsa,” she said. “You are my rock, my support, and my guiding light. I don’t know where I would be without you.”Elsa kissed Anna on the forehead and whispered, “You don’t have to worry about that, my love. I will always be here for you, no matter what.”Anna closed her eyes and sighed happily, feeling grateful and blessed to have such a loving and supportive partner by her side. And as she drifted off to sleep, she knew that her wish had come true - she had found the love of her life, and nothing could ever come between them.Two years after their adventure with Honeymaren, Elsa and Anna were blessed with a beautiful baby girl named Hilda. She had Anna’s fiery red hair and Elsa’s sparkling blue eyes, and from the moment she was born, it was clear that she was a special child.As Hilda grew and developed, Elsa and Anna couldn’t help but notice that she had inherited Elsa’s magical powers. She could create ice and snow just like Elsa, and she seemed to have a natural affinity for the elements.Anna was a little nervous at first, worried that Hilda’s powers would be too much for her to handle. But Elsa reassured her, saying that Hilda was strong and capable, and that they would help her every step of the way.And so, Elsa and Anna set about teaching Hilda how to control and use her powers. It was a long and difficult process, but they were patient and loving, and they knew that Hilda would eventually find her way.As Hilda grew older, she became more and more confident in her abilities. She could create beautiful ice sculptures, conjure up snowstorms at will, and even freeze objects solid with a single touch.Elsa and Anna were amazed by Hilda’s progress, and they couldn’t help but feel proud of themselves for helping her to reach her full potential. They knew that Hilda was destined for greatness, and they were eager to see what the future held for her.One of the people who was most excited to see Hilda grow and develop was Honeymaren. She had become Hilda’s godmother, and she loved her like her own daughter. She visited often, bringing gifts and treats and spending hours playing with Hilda in the garden.Hilda loved Honeymaren just as much, and she always looked forward to her visits. She loved hearing about Honeymaren’s adventures in the woods, and she loved the way Honeymaren told stories and sang songs.As the years passed, Hilda became more and more like her mothers. She was kind and compassionate, always looking out for those in need. She was also strong and determined, never backing down from a challenge.But above all, Hilda was a happy and joyful child, filled with wonder and curiosity. She loved exploring the kingdom, learning new things, and making new friends.And as she grew into a young woman, Hilda knew that she had the best mothers anyone could ask for. Elsa and Anna loved her unconditionally, and they were always there for her, no matter what.As Hilda stood on the balcony of the castle, watching the sunset over the kingdom, she knew that she was exactly where she was meant to be - in the loving arms of her mothers, and surrounded by the warmth and magic of her home.

"Chapter Text
The morning light came over the western rim and through the sparse canopy and flashed against the girl’s eyelids, stirring her to wakefulness. She stretched wide with a great yawn and scratched her belly to end her pandiculation. After spending the last few days at her father’s old camping spot on a pond in the Earlyshade forest, she was finally able to get a full night’s sleep, uninterrupted. It was much harder than when she was a child. She considered whether she was going to stay one more night, but she felt that if she stayed any longer, she may never end up leaving.“Lavilia Littlebottom, huh?” She said, twisting around to try getting a look at her own behind. “Is that a joke? What the hell kind of name is that? I suppose it’ll take a little getting used to.” Lavilia continued muttering to herself as she packed up her mess kit and returned her bed to its roll form. After packing up, she relieved herself and did some basic cosmetic upkeep, as much as she could without all the things she had back home.Lavilia was a bit short, even for Halfling standards, standing at only 2 feet 9 inches. She pulled her shoulder length hair into a ponytail, so as not to get it caught in every branch and twig from here to Glory Road. She had a little trouble fitting into her fathers’ old leathers. They were very uncomfortable, and with the matted fur pressed against her bare skin, she couldn’t help but think about the decades old sweat that had fully infused with the suit by now. She shivered in disgust at the smell, though there was still a hint that reminded her of her father, and that was nice.She pulled her fine dress over the armor. It was frilly and fluffy enough to effectively hide the armor and was short enough to keep her legs unrestricted, but almost as soon as she had comfortably donned the delicate fabric, it was nearly torn on an errant bush. She removed the dress immediately and neatly folded it back into her pack to be used later. Lavilia took one last look at the campsite she had always enjoyed visiting, expecting that she may never see it again.She may never see her father, or Earlyshade ever again either. Tears gathered in her eyes, but only partly from sorrow, for she was about to embark on the adventure she had always dreamed of. She was free, and she could see the rest of Foundation’s Reach, and maybe even beyond.It was only a few hours of traveling south before she came to Glory Road. After coming out of the forest, she donned her Fine clothes over her armor, but out of an abundance of caution, she followed beside the road instead of on it directly. It wasn't long before she came across a farmer traveling along the road, with a cart full of fresh produce. She waited for the perfect moment, when the farmer's cart was passing through a hilled plane, far from the towns, she made her move. She jumped onto the back of the cart, and quickly covered herself with a tarp, hiding among the crates of vegetables. She grinned to herself as the cart continued to move.It wasn’t long before she felt something uncomfortably hard and cold pressing against her. Through the dark, she was just able to make out what it was.  Hidden behind the façade of fruits and vegetables sat a full suit of plate armor, and judging by the subtle rattles she now noticed, there was more than one. Lavilia imagined her chauffeur may not be the simple farmer that he appeared. The cart didn’t stop on its way through the farmlands, but Lavilia did hear the driver make idle comments and small talk with other passersby.One farmer started to make a more directed conversation with the driver, asking about the full looking yield. The driver mentions that the yields were quite low, but his family insisted that they pack the cart in order to appear fuller to competitors. Lavilia couldn’t help but feel impressed how expertly he lied to the farmer. The cherry on top was in how the driver admitted it, with a hint of shame and an implication that he didn’t agree with his probably fictional family, all through the tone in his voice.Lavilia heard the farmer ask the cart driver his family name. She was interested herself, but the driver politely refused with a hint of fear.“I’m sure you’ve heard that the Sovereign Principality doesn’t take kindly to reports of padded inventories.” The driver said. Lavilia didn’t know exactly what the legal ramifications were for something like that, but she knew that the Principality would gladly go far and beyond any reasonable punishment for such a crime. Even the farmer seemed to understand, politely stepping away from the conversation as soon as he heard mention of the Sovereign Principality.A few more hours passed, and Vessen began to set over the distant Eastern Rim. Lavilia noticed traffic picking up slightly before the cart came to a stop. The driver worked to get the cart parked in a corner with tough access to the back, then spoke to someone, a stable hand, Lavilia had to guess. Past that, she couldn’t quite tell where the driver went, but waited several minutes to feel confident he, nor anyone else, was near the cart.As she was crawling out, one of the ropes holding the tarp down comes undone, revealing a corner of the cart’s contents. She doesn’t notice in the darkness, focusing only on getting some distance from the cart. Again, she pulled the dress off and placed it in her pack. The plan was to pretend to be a lost child in the event she was found, the dress lending well to that mask, but it would do nothing but hinder her if she were to try and get a room. After packing it away, she stepped into the Inn. Inside standing behind the combination greeting desk and bar, a stout, middle-aged man with a bushy beard and a friendly smile greeted Lavilia.“Hello, young miss!” He said, setting down the glass he was watching to give her his full attention. Lavilia knew that most humans confused halflings with children, but she wasn’t sure yet whether he was just being jovial, then he continued. “Can I help you find your parent’s anywhere?” His intonation was clearly that of a man talking to a small child. Lavilia thought that her leather, battle-worn armor and weapons on display would have given her away, but alas.“Ahem... I’d like a room and a pint, please.”“Oh! Excuse me miss, my apologies! We always have room for our halfling neighbors, not that you require much!” The innkeeper laughed, but Lavilia didn’t. His laugh went from genuine to one out of awkwardness. “A pint on the house coming up, room’s 8 Silver.”“Keep the change.” Lavilia said, flipping a gold onto the counter after hopping up onto a barstool. The innkeeper shrugged and took the gold.Lavilia didn’t have to search hard to find the man who drove the cart. He seemed to be moving from seat to seat, from the common area to the tables and the bar. Lavilia only tracked him through her peripheral vision, but maintained focused on her drink. The Innkeeper approached him as he sat at the bar.“Having trouble finding a chair, friend?” The Innkeeper asked.“You don’t know the half of it. Bum leg, hard to find anything that don’t feel like razorblades and salt-paper.” The man said. This immediately caught Lavilia’s attention. That phrase, ‘razorblades and salt-paper,’ while it makes sense to describe an intense pain, salt-paper is not a common term, or an item that the average person would ever consider or had ever seen. It was a real item, however, and Lavilia knew about it. Salt-paper was often disguised as sandpaper and was only really used as a currency on the black market. Lavilia learned this from her histories and codices on Thieves’ Cant and other underground communication tactics.In code, the man was announcing to the room that he was looking for other underground types, and he would be moving around the room into people’s eyelines, and begin non-verbal communications using inconspicuous gestures and sounds. The man leaned against the barstool for a few moments. He could see Lavilia through the mirror behind the bar, but she ignored him, opting not to reveal her Thieves’ Cant proficiency just yet. She listened for answers from any of the few other lone patrons, but heard nothing, even as the man moved to other chairs and silently asked individually. Once he had propositioned everyone without a response, Lavilia waited until just before he finished his drink. That action in traditional thieves’ etiquette would signify the end of open communications unless he ordered another drink first. As he lifted the near-empty glass from the table, Lavilia taps her glass against the table, takes a short sip, then taps again. She wasn’t sure her timing was correct, or whether the taps were the right volume. She heard the sound of the man setting his empty glass against the table, thinking that she had screwed up the phrase, then the man spoke.“Another drink, would you please?” The man grunted as he rose from his current seat, then moved into the distant, secluded corner table. When he sat down in the booth, he let out a satisfied groan, rubbing his let. “Yeah, this is the one.”“I’ll take it to him.” Lavilia said as the Innkeeper passed with a fresh glass of ale. He stopped and looked at the halfling. She continued. “Consider it my free drink.”The Innkeeper shrugged and set the glass down in front of her. She took it as well as her own unfinished mug and slid down the stool to the ground. For people her size, there was no cool way to do it. She just tried not to spill the drinks. She placed the full glass on the table in front of the man.“Can I have a seat?” Lavilia asked. The man waved his hand in approval and took a swig. “How’d you hurt your leg?” Lavilia said.“I would have asked you to buy me a drink first, but here we are already. Knee crushed under falling rock.” As the man spoke, his hands moved in front of him almost as if to overemphasize his words, but Lavilia quickly picked up on the gestures he was making. The man was effortlessly having two separate conversations at once, and in the secret one, the man was saying that he had some hot items for sale, and would sell directly, or give a percentage of the profits to be led to an established, reliable fence.“I don’t imagine you’ve spoken with a cleric?” Lavilia was surprised to find that she was able to read his gestures so fluently but had a little trouble speaking and gesturing two different concepts. She struggled through it, asking for more details about the items.“I don’t really trust magic. Not for me.” The man said, while detailing that he has some armor and weapons he wants to offload.“You’ve been burned before?” Lavilia said, but also asked how much heat the objects had.“You could call it that.” The man said and then stated that the gear was army selloff, meant to be melted down, and that they could be looking for it, but it’s unlikely. Lavilia wasn’t sure she believed him. From the little she had seen from inside the cart, the items were much shinier than she imagined army selloff would be.“I’m interested in hearing the story, if you’ll tell it.” Lavilia said, asking about prices.“I’m afraid that story’s going to cost you another ale.” The man also said 500 gold for a full plate suit and from 25 to 50 per weapon. Lavilia paused at hearing this. After paying the innkeeper, she didn’t even have 25 to her name. She signaled ‘No, thank you’ to him, but turned and raised her arm, catching the innkeepers attention and gestured for two more ales.The man nodded his head. It didn’t seem there was anything else to talk about under the table. When the innkeeper delivered the ales, Lavilia gave him a silver.“Did you really get burned?” Lavilia asked.“Did you really just ask if I’ve ever been burned?”“You know what I mean. Magic. Why don’t you like magic?”“It’s not so great.”“What? Why not?”“Magic is just too powerful for any one person to use.”“But in the right hands, like a cleric, you wouldn’t have to worry about your bum knee.”“There are a lot more wrong hands than right ones.” The man said.“Yeah... I suppose that may be true.” Lavilia said. The two took sips of their ales.“So... is there anything else you want to know about me? Or is it just the leg?”“Well, I was actually wondering where you’re headed next.”“I’m headed up to Irongate to offload my produce, maybe get across to Foundation if I play my cards right.”“Are you interested in a little company?” Lavilia said. Now that she was up close, she couldn’t help but notice how attractive he was.He is a tall, lean man with a rugged, weathered appearance. He stands at about 6 feet tall and has a slim build, but his muscles are toned. He has a sharp jawline and a chiseled nose, giving him a strong, masculine look. His hair is dark brown and kept short, with a slight wave to it, and he has a well-trimmed beard that covers his jaw and chin. His eyes are a deep brown, and they have a twinkle of mischief and a hint of danger. Lavilia was almost certain that this man was torn straight from her mother’s private novels.“Stagecoach’d probably cost you 6 silver for that trip, and it’d be a lot more comfortable, I can promise you that.”“Yeah, but this sounds more exciting.”“Traveling with a farmer? I’m not sure I understand your definition of ‘exciting’.”“At least I won’t be walking.”“Can I charge you 6 silver?”“Sure, payable on arrival.” As Lavilia spoke, she signaled that she was willing to help him offload his goods for no additional cost.“Oh really? How do I know you won’t just walk off with my 6 silver when we get there?” The man didn’t need to be coy. Lavilia knew exactly what he was talking about. Generally, people who were versed in Thieves’ Cant were... you know... thieves.“What, you don’t think you could handle a little girl?”“One of the things about magic, sometimes it’s not actually a little girl. I’m also familiar with a halfling’s penchant for trickery.”“I’m not so versed in trickery, unfortunately, but if you’re worried about illusions or disguises, we can go back to my room, and I can prove that what you’re seeing is real.” Lavilia gave the man a mischievous smile.“Hmm... maybe this trip will be exciting after all...” The man said. He reached his hand across the table. “Name’s Gino.”“Hi Gino,” Lavilia said. She placed the tips of her fingers in his palm, a custom that she had been raised with. “I’m Er... uh... Lavilia.”“It’s nice to meet you, Lavilia!” The way Gino pulled at her hand. Had Lavilia been taller, Gino would have pulled her arm further across and kissed her fingers, but in the interest of not straining a lady, he opted for a polite nod instead.Morning for the two came only a few hours before midday. Gino was already dressed when he pushed Lavilia into the day-lit bed.“We’re already behind, I’m going to be leaving in 10 minutes, with you or not.” Gino said.Lavilia sluggishly poured her naked body onto the floor and rolled around to collect her things. When she finally propped herself up to sitting on the chair, she started strapping her leather armor to her bare chest. This caught Gino’s attention.“Wait... I noticed this last night but didn’t want to say anything... You put your armor on directly over your skin?” Gino said.“Well... yeah?” Lavilia paused, feeling embarrassed. ""Why not?""“Because it’s insanely uncomfortable... isn’t it?” Gino said. Lavilia wasn’t sure what to say. “How long have you been wearing it like that?” Lavilia didn’t answer. Gino kept pushing. “Are you pretty new to armor?”“I just don’t really have anything to put on under. I have a dress, but it’s not made for that...”“You don’t have any bandages or wraps or anything?”“No...”“Hmm... Well, the innkeeper might have something if you ask him. I’d recommend doing that before we go. Grab some food too. You can get changed when we’re on the road.”Once dressed in her armor, Lavilia went downstairs and met with the innkeeper as suggested.“Would you happen to have any bandages?” Lavilia asked.“Please tell me that you didn’t bleed all over the bed or something...”“No, it’s nothing of the sort. Just trying to supply up before the next leg of my journey.”“Okay... Well, I don’t know about bandages, per say, but every once in a while, our guests leave luggage in their rooms. Let me check. Help yourself to some food at the bar while I look.”The innkeeper stepped into a storage room and Lavilia began stuffing her mouth with bacon, hash browns an
d bread, washing it all down with a complimentary cup of fruit juice. The innkeeper came back with a set of clothing.“Turns out I have something that was left behind by a halfling or a little girl, might as well give them to you.”There was a plain cotton tunic that falls just above the knees in a dull grey color and was mended in several places. The tunic was belted at the waist with a worn leather strap to hold up a pair of faded brown leggings that had seen better days. A dark shawl was also included to drape over the shoulders, made of a rough woolen fabric and frayed edges.“How much?” Lavilia asked as she opened her coin purse.“Don’t worry about it! I don’t know if I would have been able to get rid of those otherwise.”“Thank you!” Lavilia said with a smile.“Just tell other travelers about the Farmers Rest, and come on back some day!” The innkeeper gave Lavilia a warm parting smile. She took the clothing and made her way outside to meet Gino at his cart. He was in the process of hooking the cart back up to the horse. As she walked up, she noticed that the tarp was undone in the back corner, where she had snuck out the night before. While Gino’s attention was elsewhere, she fixed the tarp, then climbed up to the seat. Gino was right behind her as he finished handling the horse.“Alright, let’s go!”Not long after leaving, continuing east along Glory Road, the pair crested a hill and came upon a long stretch of lonely road with no other travelers in sight. It was the perfect opportunity for Lavilia to change, but just as she pulled the cuirass off her chest, it began to rain a light drizzle. The timing was just right, as Lavilia was really starting to notice how sticky and dirty she had been getting since setting off on her journey. She hadn’t gone so long without a bath in her life, so she stripped down to completely naked, and started lathering the rainwater around her body. Gino certainly didn’t mind the view, but he couldn’t help but notice how dark the liquid was when it came to rest on the seat.“Hey, you’re getting the seat all dirty...”“Yeah? Is this even your cart? What do you care?”“It’s not that... I mean, it is kind of. I might try and haggle on getting the deposit back for renting it, but... you’re just going to sit back down in it after you get dressed, aren’t you?”“Yeah, but honestly, the clothes I got are probably even dirtier.”“That’s no reason to make it worse!” Gino said. Lavilia looked at him through squinted eyes. While he also appeared dirty, from up close and personal, Lavilia could see that it was all oil-based makeup finely applied with a brush and, in fact, the man was actually quite clean. She was starting to get the feeling that he was obsessively so. To placate him, she hopped off the wagon and began walking alongside it, weakly focusing on cleaning herself.She didn’t seem to be keeping an eye out, so it fell upon Gino. He felt like he needed to keep an eye out for her, she was almost falling asleep as she walked. She gradually started falling behind, and after a few minutes, Gino stopped the cart to let her catch up. He hopped off the cart.“Okay, come on... let’s get you dressed and you can take a nap on the...” As Gino spoke and looked around, subtle motion just off the road caught his attention. He looked closer and could just make out the form of a little girl, trying to hide in a bush. “What the... is that a kid?”When Lavilia noticed the girl in Gino’s eyeline, she suddenly felt as naked as she actually was. The blood ran from her face, and she started running toward the cart, she lost her balance and started stumbling forward.“Noooo!” Cried the girl in the bushes. She darted into the road, directly at Lavilia. “She’s a zombie!”The girl, in a heroic attack to save the clueless man on the road, rams her shoulder into Lavilia’s side, knocking her into the wheel of the cart.“Ah fucking shit!” Lavilia yells, tumbling into the mud. “Gods dammit that fuckin’ hurt!”The little girl stood up in between Lavilia and Gino.“Back you fiend!” She yelled, brandishing a large stick and a ferocious mug. She lunged at Lavilia again, but Gino grabbed the stick, halting the girl in her tracks.“Whoa, hey! Hold on!” Gino said. The girl tried pulling the stick from Gino’s grip, but she just wasn’t strong enough. “Stop! This halfling is not undead!”“Then why’s she all naked and moving like she just came out of the grave?”“I was taking a shower!” Lavilia yelled. As she stood up, she looked over the mud covering half her body. “Now I’ve gotta do it again!” Lavilia started patting off what she could, but the little girl let go of the stick and tried charging Lavilia again. Lavilia jumped back and ran around the other side of the cart, but the girl was again stopped as Gino caught her by the shirt.“She’s not undead, little girl!” Gino said, trying to calm her down. “I’ve never heard the undead speak, have you?” As Gino said it, the little girl finally started calming down. She was racked her brain, and to Gino’s credit, she couldn’t remember ever hearing the undead speak.Gradually, the girl’s face turned from anger and ferocity to that of immense sadness as she began to cry. Gino was crushed and could do nothing but try to console the girl. Lavilia, however, wasn’t so inclined to help, especially as she started to feel the black eye the little girl had given her. Lavilia washed her body off again, at a much faster pace this time, then started donning her clothes and armor, cursing under her breath through the process.“What’s wrong?” Gino said, getting close to the girl and using his cloak to shield her from the rain. “What are you doing all the way out here?” Gino took a look in all directions but could see nobody.“My mommy, and my daddy, and all my friends are dead!” She said through forceful sobs.“Oh my Gods!” Gino said. “That’s terrible! How did that happen?”“It was the ZOMBIES!!!” The girl yelled, angry that Gino didn’t seem to be hearing her.“Okay, okay!” Gino said, patting the girl’s shoulders. “Well, you just happened to run into the two foremost hunters of monsters and the undead in the whole northwestern quad!”“... Really?” The girl said, her tear-filled eyes looking up at him with hope.“That’s right! You’ve just stumbled upon Gino and Lavilia, Hunters Extraordinaire and Nightmare to Monsters!” Gino stepped back and waived his arms, adding flair to the introduction.“B... but... you look like farmers...?”“Well sure, how else are we supposed to trick the monsters?” Gino winked at the girl, who was now starting to bear a smile. “And you know what, with the way that you jumped in to protect me from the zombie, I think you’d make a fine addition to the team!” Gino’s confident grin was soon reflected back by the girl. Gino then turned into a slightly serious face. “But we can’t just let anyone off the road into our team. We have to know more about you! Firstly... to what hero do we have the pleasure of speaking?”“Tierra!” The girl shouted.“Tierra the Terror!” Gino said with a laugh. “That’s perfect! Just the name alone will scare off any monster who dares to cross you!”“Yeah!” Tierra shouted. “Grrrrr!!!” She made her best angry growl, and Gino stumbled back, feigning fear.“Whoa! Easy there, you don’t want to be scaring me! Save some for the zombies!”With Gino keeping Tierra occupied, Lavilia was able to finish armoring up. After strapping on the last piece to her thigh, she stretched and tested her flexibility. To her surprise, the armor was no longer pinching, and the fur lining wasn’t itching her skin.“Huh... that’s not bad!” Lavilia said, hopping back up onto the cart.“Told you.” Gino said, placing Tierra on the seat next to her and hopping up himself. Once seated, he turned toward Tierra. “So... where is home?”“I’m from Irongate.” Tierra said.“Oh, really! What a coincidence, we’re on our way there ourselves, but... you must have been traveling for a while... how long were you out here?” Gino spurred the horse to continue.“Three days...”“Oh, my Gods!” Gino said with shock. “You must be starving!” He reached into his pack in the back of the cart and started digging around.“No, no... I got it...” Lavilia said. She was still upset over her shiner, but she wasn’t above sharing her stock with someone in need. She reached into her own pack and pulled out a ration, handing it to the girl. She tore into the parchment package and quickly shoved the mixture of bananas, blueberries, bread and cured meats into her mouth.“Could you tell us a little more about what happened?” Gino asked.“My friends said they heard about bodies coming out of crypts under the temple of Agzun. My friend Murnie said he saw them himself! He said their skin was all soggy and green and their eyes were all dripping like eggs and their teeth were made of maggots!” Tierra never paused for a moment to continue stuffing her mouth, and just did it as she was speaking.“Wow! That sounds very scary!” Gino said.“Did you see any of these zombies with your own eyes?” Lavilia asked.“Yes!” The girl shouted. “My neighbor, the baker-lady was getting attacked by her husband, and I heard her screaming ‘The undead are awakening! The undead are awakening!’ And I did what we trained and ran away to fight another day!”“What a brave little soldier you are!” Gino said. Lavilia rolled her eyes. They continued their discussion but weren’t able to get much more information out of the girl. Eventually it just devolved into Gino doing whatever he could to appease the kid, which wasn’t hard. Before long, the two were fast friends, and as Vessen began to set, they were like siblings. The group started their search for a good campsite as the light began to dwindle.They found a campsite nestled in a small clearing among the rolling hills just off Glory Road. The large tree that stood at the center of the clearing provided ample shelter from the light rain that was continuing to persist. Under the tree, Lavilia and Gino had set up a small fire using dry twigs and branches they had gathered from the surrounding area. The fire provided warmth and a place to cook.The campsite was simple but functional, consisting of only a few basic necessities. They had a few cooking utensils and a small pot that they used to make a stew, combining the ingredients from 3 rations. They conversed as they ate and when their bellies were full, they set up their beds. Lavilia insisted on Tierra using her bedroll, to which there were no complaints from Gino, though he did offer to share his bedroll with Lavilia. She would have liked to, but the thought of getting a full night’s sleep was very enticing to her.Lavilia crawled into the bedroll with Tierra, and the two were asleep in minutes. Gino stayed up another hour, stoking the fire and keeping them warm, then he let it fall to embers, and crawled into bed himself. As the night went on, the rain continued to fall, but the fire and the shelter provided by the large tree kept them warm and dry. It was a simple but peaceful night, with the sound of the rain and the crackling of the embers providing a soothing background noise.Morning came with Lavilia waking up first and gently slipping out of the bedroll, letting Tierra continue to sleep. She was already noticing how much earlier Vessen seemed to come up without the Western Rim in the way. The day was warm, but not uncomfortably so. As her two companions slept, Lavilia took time to stretch and do some morning exercises at the top of the hill between the camp and Glory Road. A few miles beyond the road was a large body of water, aptly named The Moat, as the center of the lake an island that the massive city of Foundation sat upon.From just about anywhere in Foundation’s Reach, the city was visible as the shining jewel at the center. It was bigger than Lavilia had ever seen it. She was much closer. What she thought was a single pillar making up the central city was actually a large number of individual spires, closely packed and connected at the top. It was getting more awe inspiring as they continued their approach. Lavilia continued to let the other two sleep, but she was getting pretty antsy about getting there.She packed up as much as she could without pulling the bedrolls directly out from under her companions, which she was starting to consider. Even though she had already done them, she began doing exercises again, this time louder, and closer to the other two. Finally, Gino started stirring to consciousness.“Oh, you’re up! Sorry, I hope I wasn’t being too loud.” Lavilia said loud enough to also encourage Tierra to wake. In quick fashion, the group returned to the road, this time at a reasonable hour.Before noon, the group came to a junction in the road, or rather, it had been a popular junction in the past, but the road heading north had fallen into disrepair, and looked like it hadn’t been used in months, if not years.“Hey, Tierra, do you have any idea where that goes?” Gino asked.“Umm... I’m not too sure, but I think it might go to Oakdale.”“Oh, really?” Gino responded. “Like, Oakdale leathers?”“Yeah, I think so.”“Have you ever been there?” Lavilia asked. Both Gino and Tierra shook their heads as Gino replied.“No, but I have heard of Oakdale leather. Supposed to be the best leather in the Reach.”“The road doesn’t look very well-traveled...” Lavilia said, pointing out the overgrown bushes and trees that were growing across the old path.“Yeah... well, it’s kind of tough to find new Oakdale leathers lately... It seems like there hasn’t been much going in or out in a while.” Gino began to think about the most recent prices he had seen regarding leather goods, and remembering how prices had been going up, made a suggestion to the rest of the group. “I don’t imagine you two want to make a detour?”“Uhhh... I dunno... I imagine the girl’s parents are probably pretty worried about her. Plus... we do have some... ‘Vegetables’ we’re trying to offload.” Lavilia said.“Plus... what if that’s where the zombies are coming from?” Tierra asked. Gino already knew it was a bad idea, but it was certainly something he was interested in checking out. Neither of the adults entertained Tierra’s notion of the undead, but it was still in the backs of their minds. They passed by the abandoned trail to Oakdale. The rest of their journey was uneventful. Down the beach, they could start to make out the bridge that spanned the moat. A marvel of engineering, running more than 20 miles over water. On foot, it would take most of the day just to cross. As they came over a hill, the town of Irongate also came into view.At first, it was too distant to tell what was going on, but it seemed like a good sign that the entire place wasn’t a wall of fire and smoke. The first people they were able to make out was a large convoy coming their way. Still too far to make out intentions, Gino, Lavilia, and Tierra’s tension rose, unsure of what they should do. They continued with caution and watching the caravan closely, but after a while of observing and approaching, the party couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary. No people attacking people. No hordes of rotting corpses walking around. Nothing but polite smiles and nods as they passed. Gino hopped off the cart and across the road, catching up to a friendly looking family heading the other way.“Hey there friends! I was wondering, have you heard about any troubles around Irongate in the past few days or so?”“Hmm... not really, seemed pretty calm mostly... The Sovereign Prince and his Army marched through but there wasn’t any fighting or quartering or anything... Oh... The Iron Bridge was shut down for a couple days... I think they might be open again today though.”“Hey, thanks a lot friend!” Gino said, fingering a piece of gold from his pouch and flipping it to the cart driver who smiled and tipped his hat. Gino returned to his own cart. “I think they would have mentioned something about the undead... It’s really starting to look like nothing bad happened here.”“Oh...” Tierra was sinking into her seat. She was starting to feel the fool, and Gino noticed her discomfort.“Well, that’s not a bad thing, actually! The opposite of a bad thing, in fact! That means that your family is okay!” Gino tried to keep the girl positive but it didn’t seem to be working, so Gino changed his approach. “Maybe... your friends were able to fight of
f the undead before they became a problem! Or... maybe you got the zombie to chase you into the forest, saving the town, and maybe even Foundation Reach!”Tierra cracked a smile, and so did Lavilia. At first, she was annoyed at how patronizing Gino seemed to be toward the girl, expecting it to be some kind of mask, hiding a darkness underneath. It was something that Lavilia had always been warned about; the evils of humankind. She had even experienced them herself, but she saw none of it in Gino. After spending the past day with him, even when he didn’t know she was there, he was a kind, genuinely gentle person. Lavilia tried to continue being skeptical, but she couldn’t wait until the next time she could share a room with him.“So you said you lived at the Inn, right? Your daddy’s the Innkeeper?” Lavilia asked.“Yeah! The Iron Bridge Inn and Tavern!” Tierra said as if it were an ad.“Great! Why don’t you guide us there?”It was a large town, much larger than Earlyshade, and would have been easy to navigate were it not for the growing density of people crowding the streets as they passed by the marketplace. They carefully navigated the busy streets, maneuvering their horse-drawn cart through the crowds of merchants, farmers, and travelers. They passed by vendors selling their wares, carts loaded high with goods, and people from all walks of life going about their business. Lavilia caught Gino’s attention with a distinct snap and began to speak to him with Thieves’ Cant.“Should we try to find a buyer?” She asked.“Keep an eye out for fence signs, but let’s finish this before contacting anyone.” Gino said. Lavilia had no idea what she was looking for. She had heard that some public vendors were secretly fences for illegal goods, and would place certain symbols or marks on their sign for thieves to recognize. Unfortunately, they were often very regional, and she was clueless as to what they were around Ironbridge. Plus, she was too overstimulated by all the other sight’s she was seeing for the first time.Gino, on the other hand, had been to Ironbridge a few times and had some ideas of the symbols that the locals used. However, there was a particularly busty Elven woman with a low-cut blouse walking parallel to the cart, and Gino’s elevated position provided him a great view of her ample cleavage. He watched for as long as he could, before she turned off down another street.As they made their way to the Iron Bridge Inn, they caught glimpses of the impressive structure stretching across the Moat, connecting Irongate to Foundation City. The Iron Bridge was a marvel of engineering and a symbol of the prosperity and wealth of Foundation City. Lavilia was blown away by the sight, but the other two were much less enthused about it. Finally, they reached the Iron Bridge Inn, a large and well-maintained building that stood proud in the center of town, at the foot of the bridge that is it’s namesake.The group pulled up to the front, and before coming to a stop, Tierra climbed over Lavilia and sprinted up the steps toward the Inn entrance. Just after rushing past a line of waiting patrons and out of view, a series of shouts rang out into the street.“Tierra!? My baby girl!?” A man shouted.“My tiara!!” A woman cried. Both voices became muffled, incomprehensible babbles.Gino and Lavilia stepped off the cart. Lavilia went up the steps after the girl while Gino stayed by the cart. Inside, the cries were loud, and Tierra was completely embraced by her parents. She was so tightly held, it was almost as if she had been attacked by the undead. As joyful as the scene was, the line of impatient customers soured it a bit. The family didn’t care. After a few minutes, Tierra pushed her parents off, and introduced them to Lavilia.“This is Lavilia, a nightmare monster hunter! I brought her here to fight the zombies!” Tierra said.“You found our little girl?” The father asked.“Umm, yeah...” Lavilia said, shyly. She gestured out the open door toward Gino and the cart. “We came across her just outside of the Western Farmlands.”“Thank the God’s for you, and your father, little girl! Vessen’s light upon your path!” The man took Lavilia’s hand and held it tightly, the woman did the same, and leaned in to embrace Lavilia tightly. The man stood up in front of her and continued. “Are you looking for room for the night?”“Uhh... sure... But, I’m not a little girl, I’m actually a halfling...” Lavilia said. She wasn’t used to the kind of attention they were giving her.“Ah, yes, our halfling savior! Our best room is yours, and fill up on beer and food, as much as you like! No charge!” The innkeeper turned and whistled toward the connected tavern and a younger man stepped out from around the corner. The innkeeper pointed toward Gino and the cart. “Get on it, now! Hustle!” He said, and the younger man rushed out to meet Gino.Gino tried to tell the man that he was okay with handling the horse and cart himself, but the man wouldn’t accept nothing less, guiding the cart and horse to the stables, and doing it fast enough that Gino couldn’t keep up. He decided to join Lavilia inside to get introduced to Tierra’s family.Patrick Highmoons was Tierra’s stoutly father, and the innkeeper for The Iron Bridge, and Tonaya was his wife, and Tierra’s gracefully beautiful mother. While they doted over their daughter’s saviors, the dismayed line of customers continued to grow. When Patrick had Tonaya show Gino and Lavilia their rooms, he returned to the counter with renewed life, and began helping his customers check in.The room was located on the top floor of the Inn and was the largest and most luxurious one. The walls were adorned with intricate wood paneling, and the ceiling was high, giving a feeling of spaciousness. The room had a king-size bed, covered in soft linens, and plump pillows, with a warm comforter.There was a sitting area near a fireplace, which was adorned with a beautiful hand-woven rug. A small table sat near a large window, overlooking the Iron Bridge, which was lit up and stretching into the night.The balcony was the highlight of the room, with a large wooden deck and a railing that offered a stunning view of the bridge over The Moat below. The night sky was clear, and as Vessen set over the Eastern Rim, the rest of the Gods, Igen and Oten, and Setris and Selvis twinkled in the distance, adding to the magical ambiance of the place.A small table with two chairs was set up on the balcony, perfect for enjoying a quiet drink while taking in the view. Overall, the room was a true oasis of comfort and luxury, and Gino and Lavilia felt grateful and lucky to have been given such a wonderful place to stay. Both Lavilia and Gino glanced at each other with a knowing look, but the night was early, and there was still something else on Lavilia’s mind.“I hope you enjoy your stay, and if you need absolutely anything, just let us know!” Tonaya said, with Tierra waving at her side.“Oh, wait... I do have a question...” Lavilia said before Tonaya could close the door. “Tierra said she ran when she heard one of your neighbors say something about awakening undead?”“Yeah!” Tierra said. “Mrs. Baker was being attacked by her husband and she kept screaming that at him!”“Uhh... Hmm...” Tonaya said, looking down at her daughter. “She’s a baker, but her name isn’t Baker, dear. I do think she was upset about something a few days ago, but I saw her and her husband not an hour ago, and they seemed as alive as ever. Well... not ever... but definitely not risen dead. Their shop should still be open for a bit longer, if you wanted to go speak with them.”“Okay, great!” Gino said. “Other than that, well... where else could she have heard about the undead?”“There’s that little sh-” Tonaya stopped herself, not wishing to curse in front of her daughter, “... ‘creative’ boy named Murnie.” The mother turned toward her daughter. “In fact, he’s been asking about your toys and books, you might want to run down to your room and check it’s all still there!”At her mother’s implication, Tierra became visibly angry and hurt, and sprinted down the hallway with an intent to kill the boy if anything was out of place. When she was out of earshot, Tonaya turned back to Gino and Lavilia, stepping forward and closing the door to a crack. In a lowered voice, she continued.“To be honest... That little bastard knows how to spin a yarn, but in this, I think there might be a grain of truth.” Tonaya said. Gino and Lavilia’s ears perked up and they leaned in.“How do you mean?” Lavilia asked.“Well, there’s the Temple of Agzun in the upper quarter... Our family used to be in the parish, but a few years ago, it started receiving a ton of attention and funding from Foundation City. Eventually, we were kind of... pushed out, to make room for the new rich patrons. The whole town was pushed out, except for those on the upper quarter, and I’d even heard that most of the regular services have stopped completely by now. And the visitors from Foundation seem to spend all of their time in the crypt below the temple. There are rumors that they have been doing something to the corpses, or using them for something... I’ve heard mention of a corpse walking out of the crypt, and I didn’t hear that from Murnie.”It was quite the fanciful tale. Both Gino and Lavilia were skeptical, there was a lot of hearsay in the story, but they caught the impression of genuine fear in Tonaya’s voice. Neither Gino, nor Lavilia had anything to say.“I heard Tierra say that you were monster hunters, is that right?” Tonaya asked. Both Gino and Lavilia scratched their heads with an uncomfortable, groaning laugh.“Well, no, not exactly.” Gino said. “I’m actually just a farmer, in town to sell my stock. Lavilia here came along with me. When we saw your girl, I just thought it might be the best thing to say to calm her and convince her to come back with us.”“Oh... I see... Well, if you come across anyone who could look into that, I’m sure the community would be willing to pay to get it checked out.”“Okay, yeah, we’ll definitely keep our eyes peeled.” Gino said. Tonaya bowed her head and backed out the door, closing it behind her. Lavilia placed her bag on one of the chairs inside, then sat down on the bed.“Well, what do you think?” Lavilia asked.“What, about the room?”“No. I mean, yeah, it’s pretty nice, right? But no, I mean about checking out this talk of undead?”“Ehh... I dunno... sounds magic-y... Not really my forte. Besides, I’ve still got to get rid of the goods. After doing that, I’ll have a pretty hefty sum!”“You mean, ‘we’ll’ have a pretty hefty sum...” Lavilia suggested.“Whoa, no, no!” Gino said, waving his hands. “There’s no ‘we’, I’ve only known you for like, 2 days! Besides, you said you would pay me 6 silver once we arrived.”“I said I would help you sell your goods.”“You said you would do that for free!”“Well... yeah... I mean... you know, c’mon!” Lavilia’s argument wasn’t exactly solid. She shook her head in a huff. “I’m not asking to take a cut or anything, I just... I dunno... was wondering if you’d let me tag along a little longer.”“Hmm...” Gino said. He crossed his arms and began pulling at the hair on his chin. “You said ‘we’. If you are going to stay in my company, I need you to understand that ‘we’ are not a thing. I’m okay with having a little fun and even doing some business together, but I just met you. If I’m being honest... it's a bit of a red flag. That, and the way you were wearing your armor, I, uh... I know you’re a halfling, and I know it’s not polite to ask a woman, but... I just gotta ask... How old are you?”Lavilia suddenly had a lot of different emotions flooding her. She felt humiliated and overbearing, and twisted it into anger. “I’m 20, asshole, and we don’t appreciate being compared to kids.” Lavilia said. “It could be considered racist.”“Alright, I can understand that, but surely halfling children exist. You weren’t born 20, were you?” Gino asked, rhetorically. Lavilia didn’t answer, Gino continued. “I’ll admit I don’t know too much about halfling development milestones, but for Elves... isn’t 20 like, equivalent to 6?”“Ugh, gross... No, that’s not... I’m not...” Lavilia shook off some of her frustration and restructured her thoughts so she could speak clearly. “I. Am. An. Adult.”“Good! Great! Thank you!” Gino tried not to let a passive-aggressive tone seep his voice.“I find it interesting that you weren’t worried about this the other night...” Lavilia said, her words cutting.“I had no reason to question it at the time. There aren’t a lot of children that can drink like you, or speak the way you do, or know Thieves’ Cant.”“Drink with a lot of kids?”“No, I was a kid who drank a lot. I’ve never known any others.” Gino said.Lavilia had no response. Among these emotions that she was feeling, now she felt guilt, and worry that she would lose him so quickly. After all the horrors she had heard and seen, and all the stories that her family told her about the world outside Earlyshade, the first person that she came across seemed to be a gentle, reasonable, generally nice man. After knowing him for only two days, she was already worried that she was going to lose him. Gino could see her discomfort. He moved over and sat down on the bed next to her.“Listen, I have been enjoying your company, truly. I just want to know you a bit better before leaping headlong into any kind of exclusive relationship. And, frankly, you probably ought to learn more about me, too. You might find something you really don’t like.” Gino said. Lavilia looked over to him.“I... don’t really have anything to say about myself.”“It’s alright... We can start with me if you want, but to tell you the truth, I kinda want to check out that bakery, maybe get some pastries, then head downstairs for some free food and drink. What do you say?” Gino asked. Lavilia nodded and took Gino’s hand, helping her off the bed.They put their bags away and made their path downstairs and out across the street. The bakery storefront was quaint and charming, with a sign hanging above the door reading ‘Agatha's Delights.’ The windows were smudged with flour and sugar, and behind them, cakes, tarts, and pastries of all shapes and sizes were displayed on wooden shelves. The door was propped open, and the warm aroma of baked goods wafted out into the street.Inside, the titular Agatha and her husband were cleaning up after a long day of baking. Agatha was wiping down the countertops, her once white apron now stained with flour and other baking ingredients. Her husband was sweeping the floor, his shirtsleeves rolled up to reveal his scrawny arms. Lavilia and Gino stepped into the shop.“Good evening! I hope we’re not too late!” Gino said. The woman behind the counter didn’t seem to respond, but the man jumped, startled at their sudden presence.“Oh... yes, no, we’re still open!” The man said, he turned toward the counter and yelled at Agatha. “Ag! Customers!” He shouted. She didn’t respond. “Ag!... Customers!” He yelled a little louder. Again, Agatha did nothing. “AAAAG!!!” The man yelled at the top of his lungs, and finally the woman turned around to see their guests.“Oh, hello! Welcome to Agatha’s Delights! What can I get for you?” Agatha’s voice was hoarse. After only a few words, both Gino and Lavilia knew how a misunderstanding could happen. Luckily, they were able to point to the items in the display case to order. Lavilia picked out a cherry tart and a cinnamon roll and Gino chose a slice of pecan pie, and a cherry tart as well.“26cp please!” Agatha said as she placed and packed their sweets in small brown paper bags. Gino reached for his coin pouch, but Lavilia batted his hand away.“I got it.” She said, pulling three silvers from her own pouch. As she set the coin on the glass countertop, Gino leaned forward.“Excuse me, ma’am, do you mind if I ask you a question?” He asked.“Ehh?” Agatha said, picking up the pieces. Lavilia motioned for her to keep the change, and Agatha smiled thankfully.“We had heard some rumors about an undead awakening. Have you heard this?” Gino asked.“What was that, dearie?” Agatha said, cupping an ear.“An undead awakening. Have you heard anything about an undead awakening?” Gino said, speaking louder and more carefully.“Unleavened bread baking? No... I’m afraid not...” Agatha said. Gino went to clarify 
again, but was cut off when Agatha continued. “I had heard it’s popularity was growing outside of Foundation, and I sent my IDIOT HUSBAND, Wilbur here,” Agatha raised her voice as she motioned toward him, “to go pick up a book on Unleavened Bread Baking from the library, but the fool instead picked up a book on bake-less cake recipes, as if I wasn’t already the best at bake-less cakes this side of the bridge.”“A little dry...” Wilbur said under his breath. Gino and Lavilia could barely hear it, but, somehow, Agatha turns toward him with murderous hate in her eyes. She grabbed a rolling pin and began to summarily pummel her husband with it.“Because of you, that Sugar Sprinkled Bitch has the only copy!” She continued hitting him as he cowered away from her. She was furious. “UNLEAVENED BREAD BAKING, YOU STUPID BASTARD! UNLEAVENED BREAD BAKING!” With the register she was trying to reach, her voice was breaking heavily, making her words almost unintelligible.Lavilia and Gino looked at each other when they realized what had happened. Satisfied with their current answer to the ‘undead awakening’ mystery and with some warm, delicious treats in their hands, the two left the bakery and the domestic dispute therein.They made their way back across the street to the tavern attached to The Iron Bridge Inn. The tavern was bustling with activity, the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses filled the air. The room was dimly lit, with lanterns hanging from the rafters casting a warm glow over the patrons.The bar was made of dark wood and stretched the length of one wall, behind it were shelves filled with glasses and bottles of all shapes and sizes. A large fireplace was crackling in the corner, a pot of stew bubbling away, its aroma mixing with the smoke from the fire.Lavilia and Gino took a seat at a small table near the fireplace. Tonaya quietly approached them, her tray loaded with a steaming bowl of stew, a loaf of fresh bread, and two mugs of frothy ale. Lavilia took a sip of her ale and let out a satisfied sigh. The taste of the ale was rich and malty, a perfect accompaniment to the hearty stew.Gino dug into the stew, savoring the flavors of beef, potatoes, and carrots. He tore off a piece of bread and dipped it into the stew, a contented smile spreading across his face.Lavilia and Gino sat back, sipping their ale, and chatting about their journey so far. They people-watched, observing the various patrons in the tavern, from rough-looking travelers to wealthy merchants. They watched for any Thieves’ Cant being used among the guests but didn’t find any. Lavilia asked Gino whether they should try opening some channels themselves, but Gino said it wasn’t necessary, and they could do it tomorrow.They finally had to wave Tonaya when she tried to give them more stew, then they each ate one of their treats. Lavilia was in heaven as soon as she bit into the gooey cinnamon roll, and Gino felt much the same with his cherry tart, they leaned back in their chairs, feeling satisfied and content. At that moment, they felt as if they could have crashed as soon as they hit the bed, but by the time they actually made it to their room, they were just awake enough to have a little fun.",0
"Once upon a time in the world of One Piece, there was a man named Kuzan, who was known as one of the most powerful and feared pirates in the Grand Line. He was a former admiral of the Marine and had the ability to control ice, earning him the nickname ""Aokiji"".However, despite his fearsome reputation, Kuzan was not a cruel man. He believed in justice, but he also believed that the Marines were too rigid in their pursuit of it, often causing more harm than good. As a result, he left the Marines and became a pirate, hoping to bring a sense of balance to the world.One day, Kuzan came across a young pirate crew that was in trouble. They were being chased by a group of Marines and were about to be captured. Kuzan could have easily taken care of the Marines with his ice powers, but instead, he chose to negotiate a peaceful resolution. He convinced the Marines to spare the young pirates and let them go free, in exchange for a promise that they would not cause any more trouble.The young pirate crew was grateful to Kuzan and asked him to join their crew as their captain. Kuzan was initially hesitant, but he saw the potential for good in the young pirates and agreed to join them.Together, Kuzan and the young pirate crew sailed the Grand Line, facing many challenges and making many friends along the way. They encountered other pirates, both good and bad, and Kuzan used his powers to help bring balance to the world, often using his wit and intelligence to resolve conflicts peacefully.Years went by, and Kuzan's reputation as a fair and just pirate grew. People came to see him as a symbol of hope, and many aspiring pirates looked up to him as a role model. He had finally found the sense of purpose that he had been searching for, and he was content with the path he had chosen.In the end, Kuzan became one of the most respected and loved figures in the world of One Piece, a pirate who was known not only for his power, but also for his kindness and compassion. And although he was feared by some, he was loved by many, a true hero in a world of chaos.",0
"The sound of Julius Caesar's boots echoed through the grand foyer of King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia's palace. He is here to make a request for the Bithynian fleet to aid in the siege of Mytilene, but he knows it will not be an easy task.A servant approaches Julius and gestures for him to follow. Julius strides confidently behind the servant, his eyes taking in the opulence of the palace. He is led into a spacious room where Nicomedes awaits, seated on a throne-like chair.""Caesar, welcome,"" Nicomedes greets him with a small nod of his head.""Your Majesty,"" Julius replies, bowing respectfully.""I hear you have come to make a request of me,"" Nicomedes says, his tone guarded.""Yes, Your Majesty. I seek the aid of your fleet in the siege of Mytilene,"" Julius says, his voice firm yet polite, smooth like honey.The two men stood facing each other, each sizing the other up. Julius, with his confident stance and piercing gaze, and Nicomedes, with his regal bearing and enigmatic smile. The air between them was thick with tension, as Julius was there to make a request that he knew would not be easily granted.But Nicomedes was not one to be swayed so easily. He leaned against the marble pillar behind him, his arms crossed in front of his chest, as he replied in a voice as calm as a summer's breeze, ""Why should I lend you my fleet, Caesar? What makes you so deserving of my assistance?""Julius was taken aback by the challenge in Nicomedes' voice. He had expected resistance, but not this level of skepticism. He took a deep breath, and in a moment of inspiration, he decided to try a different approach. He relaxed his posture and let a small smile play on his lips. ""Perhaps, Your Majesty, it would be best if we got to know each other a little better before discussing such matters. After all, a friendship built on mutual understanding is a foundation far stronger than a mere political alliance.""Nicomedes raised a curious eyebrow, intrigued by Julius' sudden shift in demeanor. He uncrossed his arms and leaned forward, his eyes shining with interest. ""I couldn't agree more, Caesar. Tell me, what is it that you enjoy most about life?""Julius leaned back in his seat, a small smile playing at the corners of his lips. ""I enjoy power, Your Majesty. The thrill of victory and the ability to shape the world to my liking.""Nicomedes chuckled, taking a sip of his wine. ""A man after my own heart. But tell me, what is it that truly brings you joy?""""The love and loyalty of my people, Your Majesty,"" Julius replied, his tone confident.""And what of love, Caesar? Do you have someone who holds your heart?"" Nicomedes asked, his gaze intense.Julius' smile faded, his expression guarded. ""I have always put the needs of my people above my own desires, Your Majesty.""""Ah, a noble sentiment, but what of passion? Don't you yearn for the touch of a lover, the warmth of their embrace?"" Nicomedes pressed, his voice husky.""I am not one to be swayed by such things, Your Majesty,"" Julius replied, his tone cool.Nicomedes leaned forward, a mischievous gleam in his eye. ""You are a man of iron will, Caesar. But don't you think it's time to let go of your control, to let yourself feel, truly feel?""Julius' eyes locked with Nicomedes', a silent challenge passing between them. ""I am in control at all times, Your Majesty. And I have no need for love or passion.""""We shall see, Caesar. We shall see,"" Nicomedes said, his lips curling into a mysterious smile.As they talked, both men were aware of the power struggle taking place between them. Nicomedes was confident and flirtatious, his words and gestures calculated to entice Julius and make him feel desired. He was amused by the Roman's stoic demeanor and was determined to crack through his defenses. On the other hand, Julius was aware of Nicomedes' intentions, but was not quite sure what to make of them. He was used to having people bow to his will and was not used to being the object of someone's affection. He found himself both intrigued and conflicted by Nicomedes' advances.The air was thick with tension as the two men continued their conversation. Nicomedes was openly flirting with Julius, his gaze lingering on him suggestively. He was confident and relaxed, his posture relaxed and his smile easy. He was enjoying this game of cat and mouse, trying to see how far he could push Julius. On the other hand, Julius was becoming more aware of the implications behind Nicomedes' words and gestures. He was starting to feel a spark of interest, but was still hesitant to act on it. He was used to being in control and was not sure how to react to someone who was so openly pursuing him.The room was filled with an undercurrent of sexual tension as the two men continued to dance around each other. Nicomedes was bold, his words and gestures designed to make Julius feel desired. He was relishing the power dynamic between them, enjoying the way Julius was starting to react to his advances. Julius, on the other hand, was torn between his interest and his desire to maintain control. He was starting to feel a pull towards Nicomedes, but was not quite ready to surrender to his desires. He was still unsure how to react to the situation, his mind warring between his attraction and his reservations.The two men parted ways, each one left to ponder their encounter and the strange pull they felt towards each other. It was clear that their paths would cross again, and that their fight for dominance was far from over.As Julius was escorted back to his room in Nicomedes' palace, his mind was swirling with thoughts about his encounter with the Bithynian king. He was slightly confused by his attraction to Nicomedes and was trying to make sense of his feelings. At the same time, he was disappointed that he had not managed to secure the fleets he needed for his siege of Mytilene. Despite his confusion and disappointment, Julius was determined to find a way to get what he wanted.As he entered his room, Julius's mind was filled with thoughts of the next day. He was certain that he had a plan to ensure that he got the Bithynian fleets, and his confidence was evident in the way he held himself. He was not one to be deterred easily, and he was determined to get what he wanted. Julius settled into his room for the night. He was already thinking ahead to the next day and what he needed to do to achieve his goals. Despite the distractions and confusion brought on by his encounter with Nicomedes, Julius was still focused on his ultimate objective. He was confident in his abilities and was determined to succeed, no matter what obstacles lay in his path.He settled into deep sleep.**The air was thick with the scent of jasmine, and the moon was a giant pearl suspended in the sky. The stars twinkled like diamonds, and the night sky was a canvas painted with the most vibrant shades of blue. The wind whispered secrets in his ear, and the sound of laughter echoed through the night.As he moved through the dreamscape, Julius encountered a series of strange and beautiful creatures. Some were like the gods of old, while others were unlike anything he had ever seen before. They danced and played in the moonlight, and their laughter was like music to his ears. But just as quickly as they appeared, they vanished, leaving Julius to wander aimlessly through the dream.The dream was a symphony of sights, sounds, and sensations, and Julius was at once both entranced and disoriented. He was caught in a state of wonder, not knowing where he was or what he was meant to do. But even as he struggled to understand the meaning of it all, he could not help but feel that there was something important hidden within the dream, something that he was meant to discover.And then, as if on cue, Nicomedes appeared in the dream. He was dressed in robes of silver and gold, and his eyes were as bright as the stars above. Julius was drawn to him, unable to look away from the king’s magnetic gaze. They stood in silence for a moment, each studying the other.As they stood there, Nicomedes approached Julius and took his hand. He led him on a journey through the dreamscape, showing him wonders that Julius could not have imagined. They walked through fields of flowers, crossed rivers of stars, and climbed mountains of crystal. Julius was filled with a sense of wonder and delight, and he felt his heart begin to flutter.But then, suddenly, the dream shifted. The sky turned black, and the stars were blotted out by clouds. The wind howled, and the ground shook beneath their feet. Julius felt a sense of fear grip him as the dream turned dark and foreboding. Nicomedes was still there, but he was different now. His eyes were cold and his smile was cruel. He led Julius through the darkness, promising to show him something that would change his life forever.They entered a cavern, deep in the heart of the dream. The air was thick with the scent of decay, and the walls were slick with some dark, viscous substance. Julius felt his heart pounding in his chest as Nicomedes led him deeper into the cavern. They approached a large, black door, and Nicomedes turned to Julius with a smile.“Beyond this door, Julius Caesar, you will find the truth of your life,” he said in a voice that was not his own. Julius hesitated, feeling a sense of dread that he could not explain. But Nicomedes pushed the door open, and Julius was forced to follow him into the bright light beyond. The intensity of the light was almost unbearable, and Julius felt a jolt run through him. He was momentarily blinded, and all he could hear was the sound of his own stunned gasp.The light was so bright that Julius had to shield his eyes, and when he finally adjusted, he realized that he was back in his room in Nicomedes' palace. He was drenched in sweat, and his heart was pounding in his chest. He sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes, trying to shake the remnants of the dream. He let out a deep sigh and laid back down, still trying to calm his racing heart. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, trying to forget the fear and uncertainty that the dream had left him with.As he lay there in the quiet of his room, Julius attempted to understand what the dream meant. The beautiful and awe-inspiring parts were a comfort to him, reminding him of his own strength and the power of his dreams. But the fear and uncertainty that had come with the foreboding parts of the dream were a source of concern for him. He felt as if he was being warned of something, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. The vivid images of the dream kept flashing through his mind, and he couldn't shake the feeling that there was something important that he was missing.Despite his fear, Julius found comfort in the idea that perhaps the dream was a message from the gods. He had always been a deeply spiritual man and believed in the power of dreams. He had heard stories of great leaders who had received important messages from the gods through their dreams, and he couldn't help but wonder if this dream was one of those messages. He lay in his bed, lost in thought, as he tried to piece together the fragments of the dream, searching for any sort of meaning or guidance that he could find. He was determined to understand what the dream meant, no matter how difficult it may be, for he knew that his future, and the future of Rome, may very well depend on it.**The sun was starting to dip below the horizon as Julius sat under the cool shade of an apple tree. He was lost in thought, the quill in his hand effortlessly transcribing his musings onto the page. The landscape around him was a sea of green, rolling hills dotted with wildflowers and the occasional fruit tree. In the distance, he could see the glimmering waters of the Bithynian sea, a tranquil and inviting sight. Julius was dressed in the finest attire that Bithynia had to offer, a gift from King Nicomedes himself. The rich fabrics clung to his form, a stark contrast to the simple togas he was used to wearing.As he wrote, a servant approached him, bowing low. ""Caesar, King Nicomedes requests your presence for dinner,"" the servant said, and Julius looked up, momentarily taken aback by the interruption. He carefully marked his place in the journal and rose to his feet, dusting off the dirt that had attached itself to his clothing. The sun was setting, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink. The air was warm and scented with the fragrances of the nearby flowers and trees.As he followed the servant back to the palace, Julius couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous anticipation. The dream from the night before was still fresh in his mind, and he couldn't shake the feeling that it was trying to tell him something. And now, he was being summoned to dine with Nicomedes, a man who he was finding increasingly difficult to resist. The prospect was both exhilarating and terrifying.The palace was a grand and imposing structure, built in the classical style of ancient Greece. Columns lined the entrance, and the walls were adorned with intricate frescoes and sculptures. The servant led Julius to the dining hall, where Nicomedes was already seated, his eyes sparkling in the flickering candlelight. The room was richly decorated, with plush couches and a long table laden with food and drink. The scent of roasted meats and spices wafted through the air, making Julius's mouth water.Nicomedes stood as Julius approached, a warm smile spreading across his face. ""Caesar, I'm glad you could join me,"" he said, gesturing to the seat next to him. Julius took his seat, feeling a flutter in his chest as he met Nicomedes' gaze. He was torn between his attraction to the king and the mission he was on, but as they sat down to dine, Julius was certain of one thing: this would be a meal to remember.As the meal progressed, Nicomedes' flirtations towards Julius became more and more obvious. Despite the raised eyebrows of the other guests at the table, he seemed not to care, his gaze fixed intently on Julius, who was growing more and more uncomfortable. Julius was used to power dynamics, to being the one in control, but Nicomedes was challenging that, and it left Julius feeling off-balance.With every passing moment, Nicomedes' touch lingered a little longer, his gaze becoming more intense. Julius could feel the heat radiating from the king's hand, even as he tried to remain composed and keep up his end of the conversation. The other guests seemed not to notice, but Julius was acutely aware of Nicomedes' every move, and he couldn't help but wonder what the Bithynian king was after.As the meal drew to a close, Nicomedes leaned in close to Julius, his breath warm on Julius' ear as he whispered, ""I hope you're enjoying your stay here in Bithynia, Caesar. I have so much more to show you."" The sly smile on his face and the glint in his eye made Julius feel like he was walking a tightrope, unsure of where this path was leading him, but unable to resist the pull of Nicomedes' charm.As the dinner came to an end, Nicomedes and Julius excused themselves from the table and made their way to Nicomedes' room. The air between them was charged with an electric tension, anticipation crackling in the silence. The sound of their footsteps echoed down the halls as they made their way to Nicomedes' bedchamber. The atmosphere was heavy with an unspoken understanding, their bodies drawn to each other like magnets.Once inside, the room was bathed in candlelight, casting a warm glow over everything. Nicomedes approached Julius, his eyes locked onto the general's, a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips. The air between them was thick with desire, and they both knew what was going to happen next. In the stillness of the room, their bodies came together in a slow and steady rhythm, exploring each other in a way that felt both new and familiar.As they lay in the plush bed, Caesar’s arm draped over Nicomedes’ broad chest, they both knew that they had just crossed a line. Nicomedes promised Caesar the fleet he had been searching for, but Caesar found that he no longer cared. In that moment, all he wanted was to bask in the afterglow of their encounter, feeling the warmth of Nicomedes' body against his own. Their hearts beating in perfect synchrony, the two men found comfort in each other's embrace. They were in a world all their own, 
far from the prying eyes of the outside world. It was just the two of them, wrapped up in each other, and nothing else mattered.**As Julius prepared to leave Nicomedes’ palace, he couldn't shake the sadness that weighed on him. He had formed a deep connection with the King during their time together, and the thought of leaving him behind was almost unbearable. Nicomedes, for his part, seemed to be taking the separation in stride, but the sadness was clear in his eyes as well.As they said their goodbyes, Julius couldn't help but feel like he was leaving a piece of himself behind. Nicomedes pulled him into a tight embrace, kissing him deeply, their bodies pressed together in a final moment of passion. When they finally parted, Julius felt like he had been torn in two.As he boarded the ship that would take him away from Bithynia, Julius stood at the rail. The sea was calm as the ship pulled away from the shore, and Julius watched as the palace grew smaller and smaller in the distance. The water was a deep blue, stretching out to the horizon, and he was lost in thought as he remembered his time with Nicomedes. He was filled with a mixture of sadness and joy, and he was still trying to make sense of the powerful emotions that had overtaken him. He was filled with longing for Nicomedes, for the touch of his skin and the sound of his voice.He knew it was in vain. They would not meet again.**My Dear King:And so I pen these final words,
With ink and quill, my heart still burns,
For memories of you, my king,
Whose touch, whose love, doth make me sing.In this moment, on this ship,
I gaze upon the ocean's grip,
And think of you, with eyes so bright,
And all the joys, both day and night.Farewell, my love, our paths divide,
But in my heart, you'll forever bide,
A treasure trove of sweetest thought,
A flame that will not die, be sought. by ChatGPT & caesarcult",0

It was the end of the school year, and Nick and Charlie were sitting in the park, enjoying the warm sunshine. They had been dating for a few months now, and everything was going well. They had become each other's best friend and support system, and they were both excited to spend the summer together.

""Hey, Nick,"" Charlie said, breaking the comfortable silence between them. ""What are you doing for the summer?""

Nick shrugged. ""Not much, I guess. Hanging out with you, working a little, playing some video games. What about you?""

""I don't have any plans either,"" Charlie said, looking down at his hands. ""I was thinking maybe I could come to your house for a little while. I could help your dad with the garden or something.""

Nick grinned. ""That sounds great. I'm sure my dad would love the company. And we could do some fun stuff too. Maybe go camping or something.""

Charlie's eyes lit up at the idea. ""That sounds amazing, Nick. I've never been camping before.""

Nick took Charlie's hand, lacing their fingers together. ""Then we'll have to go. I'll teach you how to start a fire and everything.""

Charlie laughed. ""I'm sure you will. You're so outdoorsy.""

Nick rolled his eyes. ""I am not outdoorsy. But I do like camping. And I like spending time with you.""

Charlie leaned over and pressed a soft kiss to Nick's lips. ""I like spending time with you too, Nick. You make me so happy.""

Nick felt a warmth spread through his chest, and he leaned in for another kiss. They stayed there for a few minutes, lost in each other, before pulling away reluctantly.

""I should probably get going,"" Charlie said, looking at his watch. ""I told my mom I'd help her with dinner tonight.""

Nick nodded, standing up with Charlie. ""I'll walk you home.""

They made their way through the park, hand in hand, enjoying the last bit of the warm sun on their faces. As they got closer to Charlie's house, Nick felt a sense of dread building in his chest.

""Hey, Charlie,"" he said, stopping him on the sidewalk. ""Can I ask you something?""

""Of course,"" Charlie said, turning to face him.

Nick took a deep breath, his heart pounding in his chest. ""I know we've only been dating for a few months, but...I love you, Charlie. And I don't want to spend the summer without you. I want to be with you every day. And I want to keep being with you after the summer is over. Will you...be my boyfriend? For real?""

Charlie's eyes widened, and he looked up at Nick, his own heart racing. ""Yes,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""Yes, Nick. I'll be your boyfriend.""

Nick felt a rush of joy and relief flood through him, and he pulled Charlie into a tight hug. ""Thank you, Charlie. You've made me so happy.""

Charlie hugged him back, his face buried in Nick's shoulder. ""I love you too, Nick. More than anything.""

They stood there for a few minutes, wrapped in each other's arms, before finally pulling away. They exchanged a final kiss before Charlie turned and walked up the path to his house.

Nick watched him go, feeling like his heart was going to burst with happiness. He had never felt this way about anyone before, and he knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Charlie.",0

The sun had just set over the sprawling metropolis, and the sky was painted with a beautiful orange and pink hue. In the quiet of his luxurious penthouse, Arthur sat alone in the living room, staring out the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was his favorite time of day, when the bustle of the city was replaced with a sense of stillness. He savored the peacefulness before the chaos of his daily life resumed.He was lost in his thoughts when he heard a knock at the door. He knew who it was before he even got up to answer it. His family always knew when to pay him a surprise visit. Arthur sighed, knowing that he was in for another round of their matchmaking attempts.Opening the door, Arthur was greeted by his father Uther, his half-sister Morgana, and his mother Ygraine. They all looked pleased with themselves, as if they had a secret they couldn't wait to share.""Arthur, darling, we have someone we'd like you to meet,"" Ygraine said, her eyes sparkling with excitement.Arthur felt his stomach drop. He knew what was coming, but he tried to keep a neutral expression. He didn't want to offend his family, but he also couldn't bear the thought of going through another awkward introduction to some woman he had no interest in.""Who is it this time?"" Arthur asked, trying to sound casual.""A lovely young lady named Gwen,"" Morgana said, stepping forward. ""We think you'll really hit it off.""Arthur sighed inwardly. He had no doubt that Gwen was a perfectly nice person, but he just wasn't interested in her, or any of the other women his family had tried to set him up with. He'd never been one to settle for someone just because they were a good match on paper.""Thanks, but no thanks,"" Arthur said with a smile. ""I'm not really looking for anything right now.""His family didn't seem to take the hint. They continued to press him, trying to convince him to at least give Gwen a chance. But Arthur was adamant. He didn't want to waste his time or hers.As his family finally left, Arthur slumped down onto the couch, feeling more exhausted than ever. He loved his family, but sometimes their constant meddling was too much to bear. He wished they could just accept him for who he was, instead of trying to turn him into someone he wasn't.That's when an idea struck him. He could tell them he was already taken. He could say he was married to his best friend, Merlin. Arthur knew that Merlin had been in love with him for years, but he'd always thought of Merlin as just a friend. But maybe, just maybe, this fake marriage farce could get his family off his back.Arthur couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. He knew it was a ridiculous idea, but the thought of his family's reaction was too tempting to resist. And who knows, maybe pretending to be in love with Merlin would help him see his friend in a new light.",0

"Once there lived a group of magical coffee beans. These beans were very competitive and they each hoped to become the most popular coffee bean one day.There was the rare and exotic Excelsa bean, who was a gourmet bean. She had a woody or fruity flavor, but when roasted dark, she took on a fuller, chocolate flavor. She was often invited to specialty coffee shops and she was highly resilient in the face of trouble. But she put most of her energy into putting down roots whenever she traveled to a new place, so she could taste like dirt.Next there was the sweet and cheerful Eugenioides bean, who was happiest in a cozy cafe with a small group of close friends. She had a sweet flavor and liked to surprise her people with notes of strawberry and guava. But she had less caffeine than the rest of her family, so she wasn’t as famous.Next there was the bold and brash Robusta bean, who always wanted to be the center of attention. He loved to boast about his high caffeine content and his strong, full-bodied flavor. But his boastfulness often got him into trouble, and he often found himself being ground up and brewed into strong, bitter cups of coffee that no one wanted to drink.Finally, there was the delicate and refined Arabia bean, who was the daughter of the sweet Eugenioides and bold Robusta. She was the most popular of all the coffee beans, attracting envy from all, even her own father. She had a delicate floral aroma and a smooth, sweet flavor. She was often sought after by the finest coffee shops and restaurants. But she was also very sensitive and she didn’t like being roasted too dark or brewed too strong, lest she lose her delicate flavor.Each coffee bean was ambitious and hard-working. Each assumed that they deserved to be the most popular.One day, a contender arrived, Chi-AEA-12. He was faster, stronger, and more productive than any other bean. He had been created in a lab to resist drought, heat, and even frost. But he needed to be cloned because growing him from seed made him unpredictable.At first the coffee beans were jealous of their rival, but soon found that he was a mild, gentle bean with a traditional flavor profile. He could be stodgy or uninteresting, even bland, but he was productive and had just the right amount of caffeine.The beans began to worry that he would replace them.“He is more productive than I,” said Excelsa.“He grows faster than I,” said Eugenioides.“He is milder than I,” said Robusta.“He’s too mild,” grumbled Arabia. “It’s like drinking tea.”“Arabia!” cried Eugenioides in exasperation. “We don’t use that kind of language on this farm!”“Sorry,” said Arabia. “He is not as sensitive as I.”Eugenioides reassured the others with her characteristic upbeat attitude and sweetness, even though she was secretly worried too. She said, “Don’t panic! I love everyone. You still have your strengths. Everything is going to be fine.”Everything was not fine. Soon the entire landscape was covered in copies of Chi-AEA-12. Every one of them was an identical, stodgy, productive clone. The other beans had been relegated to the outskirts of the farm, where they were neglected.“This is the end,” sighed Robusta, who was always dramatic.One day, something terrible happened. A new kind of disease, one that had never been seen before, attacked Chi-AEA-12. The disease was difficult to detect. Once Chi-AEA-12 showed signs of illness, it was already too late and the disease had spread to the rest of his clones. To make matters worse, the disease attracted swarms of insects that gobbled up everything in sight.The disease hurt Eugenioides, Robusta, and Arabia, too, but once Excelsa realized it wasn't too late for her friends, she leapt into action.The resilient Excelsa became a foundation for her friends. Although she had devoted the most energy to her deep roots, began to fear that even grafting her friends to her body wouldn’t be able to save them.“You can do this!” exclaimed the ever-cheery Eugenioides. “You’re the best!”Eugenioides’s optimism inspired all of the coffee beans to continue the fight.Excelsa had lost many of her roots, true, but the time she had spent growing them would pay off. She still had plenty of roots left. She could support herself. She could support her friends. She knew she would make it.She fought the infection until the rot slowed, then stopped.“I did it!” Excelsa was pleased.The first part of the disease was over, but soon the smell of rot attracted the swarm of insects. The insects began to eat the plants.Crunch, crunch, went the insects.“Ouch!” went the coffee beans.Robusta fought off the swarm of insects with his caffeine. He made a big deal of showing off how great his caffeine was and basked in all the attention and glory. The other coffee beans politely agreed that Robusta was the best.Soon the insects had been defeated. Excelsa’s roots were on the mend.“Now what?” said Excelsa. “We survived, but now what?”They all thought about it.As a group, they had fallen so far into obscurity, thanks to Chi-AEA-12’s popularity. Without him, they were the only coffee plants left in the country.“I can help,” said Arabia.The re-discovery of Arabia’s sweet and delicate flavor brought her back from the brink of oblivion. Soon Robusta’s boldness, Eugenioides’s sweetness, and Excelsa’s strength were re-discovered too.Although Arabia became the most popular bean again, the other beans realized that popularity was not as important as they had once imagined. They were valuable because of their different personalities. They had needed each other’s differences to survive.They had lived, not by being faster or stronger, but by working together. Even Robusta bean was willing to let his daughter outshine him. He was proud of her, after all. They all felt like a big, happy family.The End",0

As he walked out of his building, he noticed his neighbour, Annie Edison.Annie was a political writer for the New York Times, and Jeff always admired her intelligence and passion for politics. They often had lively debates and discussions about the latest news over coffee in the lobby of their building.As Jeff walked towards the subway station, he bumped into his friends, Abed Nadir and Troy Barnes. They lived together in a loft in SoHo, and Abed was a talented filmmaker while Troy played football for the Giants. They were discussing their latest project, a short film that they were shooting on the streets of New York.Jeff, Annie, Abed, and Troy often hung out together, and their group was completed by Britta Perry, an activist who lived in the West Village in a loft paid for by her parents. Britta often sought legal advice from Jeff, and he enjoyed the opportunity to show off his legal knowledge.Their building was unique because the main floor was a famous restaurant owned by Shirley Bennett, a famous chef. The restaurant was always busy, and the delicious smells wafted up to the apartments above, making everyone hungry.As Jeff settled into his office, he couldn't help but think about his neighbour, Annie. He had always admired her from afar but had never been brave enough to make a move. He wondered if they could ever be more than just friends.Meanwhile, Craig Pelton, who lived next door to Jeff and across from Annie, had a crush on Jeff. He often tried to find ways to bump into him and would linger in the hallway just to catch a glimpse of him.As the day progressed, the group of friends all went about their business, but they always found time to connect. They shared their successes and failures, and their support for one another was unwavering.As the sun set over the city, the group of friends all met up at Shirley's restaurant. They laughed, ate, and talked about their lives. Jeff found himself drawn to Annie's intellect and beauty and wondered if it was time to take a chance and ask her out on a date.As the night came to an end, the group hugged and went their separate ways. Jeff walked Annie home, and as they said goodbye, he took a deep breath and asked her out on a date.Annie smiled and said yes, and as they walked away, Craig Pelton watched from across the street, feeling heartbroken. But he knew that the group of friends would always be there for him, and he found solace in their friendship.The group of friends continued to navigate life in New York City, always there for one another through thick and thin.",0

Marc and Nathaniel had been spending more time together lately, both in and out of school. They bonded over their shared love of art and often found themselves lost in conversation for hours at a time.One day, after school, Marc invited Nathaniel over to his house to work on a collaborative project. As they settled in, Marc couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous excitement building within him. He had been harboring feelings for Nathaniel for a while now, and he couldn't help but wonder if the other boy felt the same way.As they worked on the project, Marc found himself stealing glances at Nathaniel, who seemed lost in his work. He was so focused that he didn't notice Marc's gaze, but Marc couldn't help but appreciate how beautiful he looked in that moment.Finally, Nathaniel leaned back, stretching his arms above his head.

It was a look of warmth and affection, and for a moment, Marc thought that maybe Nathaniel felt the same way he did.Without thinking, Marc leaned in and pressed his lips to Nathaniel's. It was a soft, tentative kiss, but it was filled with all the emotions that Marc had been holding back for so long.Nathaniel's eyes widened in surprise, but he quickly responded, deepening the kiss.

"Once upon a time, in a Minecraft world far, far away, there were two best friends named Skeppy and Badboyhalo. They were the best of friends, always hanging out together, building amazing creations, and exploring new lands. But there was something special about their friendship that neither of them could quite put their finger on.One day, while they were wandering through a lush forest, Skeppy couldn't help but notice the way that the sun was shining on Badboyhalo's golden hair.

Kamon's hunger grew as he waited in anticipation for his dinner. He fidgeted in his seat, tapping his fingers on the table and scanning the kitchen for any signs of his meal. Finally, his mom appeared, a plate of hot food in her hands.""Kamon, it's time for dinner,"" Kamon's mother called out from the kitchen.""I'll be down in a second!"" Kamon yelled back from his room.After a few moments, Kamon made his way down to the kitchen, his stomach grumbling with hunger. He took a seat at the table and eagerly awaited his dinner.As he sat down at the table, his mom placed a steaming plate of food in front of him. The aroma of freshly cooked rice and stir-fried vegetables wafted up to his nose, making his mouth water. He couldn't wait to dig in.For the first few minutes, Kamon ate in silence, savoring every bite of his delicious meal. As he reached the end of his plate, his mom spoke up.""Professor Elm called earlier, he said he wants to talk to you about something.""Kamon's interest was piqued. Professor Elm was a well-respected scientist and researcher, and Kamon had always looked up to him. ""Thanks for letting me know, Mom. I'll finish up my meal and head over to see him right away.""Kamon's mind raced with possibilities. What could Professor Elm want to discuss with him? He couldn't wait to find out.Kamon ate his food hastily, his mind preoccupied with the thought of finally getting his first Pokémon. He couldn't wait to start his journey and explore the vast world that lay beyond his small hometown of New Bark Town.With his stomach now full, Kamon made his way to Professor Elm's lab. As he approached the entrance, he couldn't help but notice a strange guy standing outside. The young man appeared to be around the same age as Kamon, but something about him seemed off. His demeanor was guarded, and his eyes darted around furtively as if he was on high alert. Curious, Kamon approached the stranger. ""So, this is the famous Professor Elm's lab,"" he remarked, glancing over his shoulder. ""What are you doing here?""The stranger turned to face Kamon, eyeing him suspiciously. ""I am, well, looking,"" he replied cryptically.Kamon furrowed his brow, unsure of what to make of the stranger's response. Before he could say anything else, the guy cut in. ""Well, stop looking,"" he snapped, turning his attention back to the lab.Kamon couldn't shake off the strange encounter with the guy outside the lab, but he tried his best to push it out of his mind as he stepped inside the lab. The familiar smell of chemicals and the hum of machines greeted him as he made his way over to Professor Elm, who was busy examining some papers on his desk.As Kamon entered Professor Elm's lab, the scientist greeted him warmly. ""Ah, Kamon, good to see you,"" the professor said warmly. ""I'm glad you made it. I have something important to discuss with you.""Kamon's curiosity was piqued once again. What could the professor want to talk to him about? As he listened to Elm's explanation, Kamon's mind raced with possibilities. It seemed that he was about to embark on an exciting new adventure.""I needed to ask you a favor,"" Elm said, a serious look on his face.Kamon was intrigued. He knew that when Professor Elm had something important to discuss, it usually meant an adventure was on the horizon. ""What is it?"" he asked, eager to hear the details.""I need you to go to another lab near Cherrygrove and retrieve something for me,"" Elm explained. ""There's a researcher there who claims to have discovered a new breakthrough in technology. I need you to retrieve it and bring it back to me as soon as possible.""Kamon listened intently, his mind already racing with possibilities. He knew that any new discovery in the world of science could have far-reaching implications. ""What exactly is it that I'll be retrieving?"" he asked.Elm shook his head. ""I'm not entirely sure, but from what I've gathered, it's some kind of new device or invention that this researcher has developed. I need you to bring it back to me so that I can examine it more closely.""Kamon nodded, excitement coursing through his veins. ""Consider it done,"" he said confidently.""Okay, but before you head out, you can choose one of these Pokémon that were sent to me,"" Professor Elm said, gesturing to three Poké Balls on his desk. Kamon's eyes widened with excitement at the thought of finally starting his Pokémon journey.The professor continued, ""There's a Cyndaquil, a fire Pokémon, a Totodile, a water Pokémon, and a Chikorita, an earth Pokémon. Choose the one you want.""Kamon studied each ball carefully, reading the labels and looking at the pictures of the three Pokémon. After some consideration, he decided on the Totodile. ""He looks cute. I'll nickname him Toto for short,"" he said, grinning from ear to ear as he held the Poké Ball containing his new companion.Totodile was a small, quadrupedal Pokémon with blue-green skin and a yellow, V-shaped marking on its chest. Its head was large and round, with sharp teeth that protruded from its wide, open mouth. Totodile's eyes were a bright shade of red and it had small, clawed hands and feet.The water-type Pokémon had a long, powerful tail that it often used to smack against the ground or to swim through the water. Its body was covered in rough, hard scales that provided protection against attacks. Totodile's appearance was both intimidating and adorable at the same time, making it a popular choice among trainers.During battles, Totodile would often stand on its hind legs and show off its muscular arms, ready to attack with its powerful jaws or its claws. But outside of battle, Totodile was known to be playful and mischievous, often playing pranks on its trainers or fellow Pokémon.Kamon couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and excitement as he gazed down at his new Pokémon. Toto was going to be an important part of his journey and he couldn't wait to see what adventures they would have together.""Good choice,"" Elm said, smiling. ""Here, take these Potions as well. They'll come in handy on your journey."" Kamon eagerly accepted the items and placed them carefully into his backpack.With that, Kamon left Professor Elm's lab and headed towards Cherrygrove. He was eager to see what this new invention was all about and what it could mean for the future of science.As he stepped out of the lab, Kamon felt a sense of adventure brewing inside him. He looked down at Toto, who was gazing up at him with a curious expression. ""Let's go, Toto. Our journey has just begun,"" Kamon said, and they set off into the unknown together.Kamon was filled with excitement and anticipation as he embarked on his Pokémon journey. He had no idea what challenges lay ahead, but he was determined to become a great Pokémon trainer and make his mark in the world.Kamon gazed out at the serene landscape that surrounded his small hometown of New Bark Town. The town was nestled at the foot of a gentle hill, and the houses were scattered throughout the area, each with its own neat garden and picket fence.In the center of the town stood a large tree, with a swing hanging from one of its sturdy branches. Kamon had many fond memories of playing on that swing with his friends, and he couldn't help but smile at the thought.To the north of the town, there was a small river that flowed into the sea. Kamon loved spending time by the river, fishing and enjoying the peacefulness of the water flowing by. He would often sit on the bank, casting his line into the water and watching the colorful Pokémon that swam beneath the surface.New Bark Town was a quiet place, where everyone knew everyone else. It was a place where people took the time to stop and chat, and where the community came together to celebrate special events and holidays.As Kamon looked around at the familiar surroundings, he felt a sense of nostalgia wash over him. He had grown up in this town, and it held a special place in his heart. But now, with his new Pokémon by his side, he was ready to venture out into the world and see what other wonders awaited him beyond the safety of his hometown.As Kamon set out on his journey, he couldn't help but think about his friend Krystal, who had mentioned she would be visiting a nearby town. He wondered how she was doing and what adventures she was having on her own journey.Kamon and Krystal had grown up together in New Bark Town and had always dreamed of becoming Pokémon trainers. They had spent countless hours discussing their favorite Pokémon, their ideal strategies for battles, and their hopes for their future journeys.But now, as Kamon set out on his own journey, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness at the thought of not having Krystal by his side. He knew that they would each have their own unique experiences, but the thought of not sharing them with his childhood friend made him feel a little lonely.Still, Kamon was determined to make the most of his journey and become the best trainer he could be. And maybe, just maybe, he would run into Krystal again and they could share their stories and adventures with each other.Kamon took a leisurely stroll around the quaint town, admiring the charming architecture of the buildings and the serene beauty of the surrounding nature. As he wandered, his mind drifted to the strange encounter he had earlier at the lab. He couldn't shake off the image of the mysterious guy he had seen through the window, seemingly fixated on something.Curiosity gnawed at him, urging him to investigate further. Kamon retraced his steps and found himself back in front of the lab, where the guy was still standing in the same spot, his gaze unwavering. Kamon's interest piqued even more as he wondered what the guy was so captivated by.However, he decided not to interrupt the stranger's musings and continued on his way. He made his way to Route 29, a winding path that led through a dense forest. The rustling of leaves and chirping of birds provided a calming soundtrack as he ventured deeper into the woods.Kamon walked with purpose, his thoughts consumed by the mysteries that lay ahead. As he walked, he kept a sharp eye out for any interesting sights or sounds that might catch his attention. He was excited to see where this journey would take him, and what secrets he might uncover along the way.Kamon strolled through Johto Route 29, a picturesque pathway that meandered through a dense forest. Towering trees stretched towards the sky, their lush canopies casting dappled shadows on the ground below. The forest floor was a carpet of emerald green, blanketed by thick layers of foliage and underbrush.As he walked, Kamon breathed in the fresh, earthy scent of the forest, feeling invigorated by the crisp air. The sounds of rustling leaves, chirping birds, and the occasional scurrying of small creatures provided a soothing symphony that complemented the natural beauty surrounding him.The path was well-trodden, evidence of the many trainers who had traversed this route in their quest to become stronger. Kamon saw several Pokémon darting in and out of the foliage, their vibrant colors adding splashes of brightness to the verdant landscape. He couldn't help but smile at the sight of a group of Pidgeys soaring overhead, their wings beating in perfect harmony.The forest was not without its dangers, however. Kamon was alert to the possibility of encountering wild Pokémon, ready to battle if necessary. He took care to avoid any suspicious-looking bushes or dark corners, mindful of the possibility of an ambush.Despite the potential dangers, Kamon found the route to be a peaceful and enchanting place, with an aura of mystery and magic that sparked his imagination. He knew that there were many adventures to be had on this route, and he looked forward to exploring them all.Out of nowhere, a wild Sentret leapt from the tall grass, baring its sharp claws and teeth in a menacing snarl. Kamon was caught off guard by the sudden attack, but he quickly reacted by reaching for his trusty Pokémon partner.Without hesitation, Kamon withdrew a red and white sphere from his backpack and hurled it into the air. With a bright flash of light, a small but fierce-looking Pokémon materialized before him - his loyal Totodile, Toto.Toto landed gracefully on the ground, snarling back at the aggressive Sentret with determination in his beady eyes. His scales glistened in the sunlight, reflecting his readiness for battle.Kamon took a deep breath and focused his attention on the battle at hand. He knew that he had to be strategic if he wanted to emerge victorious against this wild Pokémon. ""Toto, use your Water Gun attack!"" he commanded, pointing at the Sentret.Without a moment's hesitation, Toto let loose a powerful stream of water from his jaws, sending the Sentret flying backwards. The wild Pokémon landed with a thud, looking dazed and disoriented.However, Kamon knew that the Sentret was not out of the game yet. ""Be careful, Toto! That Sentret still has some fight left in it,"" he warned.The Sentret growled and sprang back to its feet, ready for another round. It charged towards Toto, aiming a swift swipe with its sharp claws.""Toto, dodge and use Scratch!"" Kamon shouted, his heart racing with excitement.Toto was quick to evade the Sentret's attack, sidestepping the wild Pokémon with ease. With lightning-fast reflexes, he retaliated by delivering a sharp Scratch attack to the Sentret's back, leaving a visible gash.The Sentret screeched in pain, but it refused to back down. It lunged towards Toto once again, determined to take down its opponent.Kamon and Toto were ready for whatever the Sentret had in store for them. With their eyes locked on their opponent, they stood their ground, ready to fight until the very end.Toto's claws left deep scratches on the wild Sentret's fur, causing it to flinch in pain. In retaliation, the Sentret charged towards Toto and tackled him with full force. Toto took the hit, grunting as he stumbled backward, but he remained steadfast and determined to win this battle.The wild Sentret had taken some damage, but it still had plenty of fight left in it. It was now Toto's turn to attack, and Kamon knew that he had to be smart with his choices. ""Use your Leer attack, Toto!"" Kamon yelled.Toto locked eyes with the Sentret and unleashed a menacing Leer, causing the wild Pokémon's defenses to fall. The Sentret's eyes widened in fear, knowing that it was now vulnerable to Toto's next move.However, the Sentret wasn't about to give up without a fight. It charged at Toto with another tackle, causing him to take even more damage. Toto winced in pain, but he remained focused on the task at hand. He knew that he had to finish this battle quickly.""Toto, finish it off with a Scratch attack!"" Kamon shouted.Toto lunged at the Sentret with renewed vigor, his claws glinting in the sunlight. His scratch attack hit the Sentret squarely in the chest, causing it to stagger backward. However, the Sentret still had a sliver of health left, and it was not about to go down without a fight.In a desperate attempt to win, the Sentret tackled Toto once again, causing him to wince in pain. Toto's health bar had dropped below halfway, but he refused to give up. He knew that he had to land one final blow to secure the victory.With his jaws clenched and his eyes ablaze with determination, Toto prepared for one final attack. He lunged at the Sentret with all his might, his claws extended and ready for the kill. With a mighty Scratch attack, Toto landed the final blow, defeating the wild Sentret once and for all.Kamon watched as the wild Pokémon lay unconscious on the ground, defeated by Toto's final Scratch attack. He felt a surge of pride and excitement as he realized that he had just won his first battle on Route 29.""Toto, you were amazing!"" Kamon exclaimed, his voice filled with pride. ""That was a tough opponent, but you held your ground and emerged victorious. Well done!""Toto looked up at his trainer, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction. He knew that he had done well, and he felt proud of himself for winning the battle.Kamon walked over to Toto and patted him on the head. ""You're going to be a great Pokémon someday,"" he said. ""I can feel it.""With a smile on his face, Kamon continued on his journey through Route 29. He knew that there were more battles to be won and more challenges to overcome, but he fel
t confident that he and Toto were up to the task.Kamon breathed a sigh of relief as he recalled Toto back into his Pokéball. He knew that battles like these were a test of strength and strategy, and he felt proud of Toto for emerging victorious against a formidable opponent.As they walked, Kamon marveled at the beauty of the surrounding landscape. The sun was beginning to set, casting a warm glow over the fields and trees. In the distance, he could see the outline of a small village, and he felt a sense of excitement at the thought of exploring it.But for now, Kamon was content to walk through the fields with Toto by his side, enjoying the quiet beauty of the Johto region. He knew that there were many adventures waiting for him, and he was excited to see where his journey would take him next.Kamon stood in the center of Cherrygrove, taking in the sights and sounds of the quaint little town. The buildings were small and simple, with wooden walls and shingled roofs that gave them a cozy, rustic feel. The streets were lined with trees and flowers, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming plants.As he walked around, he noticed that the locals were friendly and welcoming. They all seemed to have a deep love and respect for Pokémon, and he saw many of them out walking with their beloved companions by their side. He also noticed that there were many shops and services available in town, including a Poké Mart, a Pokémon Center, and even a small museum dedicated to the history of the Johto region.But what stood out to Kamon the most was the stunning view of the ocean from the edge of town. The crystal-clear waters stretched out as far as the eye could see, sparkling in the sunlight and beckoning him to come closer. He knew that there were many water-type Pokémon to be found in those waters, and he couldn't wait to explore the area and see what he could catch.All in all, Kamon found Cherrygrove to be a charming and inviting town, filled with friendly people and exciting opportunities for Pokémon trainers like himself. He knew that he had made the right choice in starting his journey here, and he couldn't wait to see what other wonders lay ahead in his travels throughout Johto.Kamon wandered through the bustling city of Cherrygrove, taking in the sights and sounds of the busy streets. As he made his way towards the city's outskirts, he noticed an old man sitting on a bench, looking lost and confused.""Excuse me, sir,"" Kamon said, approaching the man. ""Do you need any help?""The old man looked up at Kamon and smiled gratefully. ""Yes, I'm afraid I've gotten myself a bit turned around. I'm trying to find my way to the local market.""Kamon smiled back at the man. ""No problem, I can help you with that. Just head down this street and take a left at the next corner. You'll see the market on your right-hand side.""The old man thanked Kamon and began to make his way towards the market. Kamon watched him go, feeling a sense of satisfaction at having helped someone in need.As he continued on his own journey, Kamon thought about his next destination. He needed to find Route 30, and he wasn't quite sure where to look. Just then, he noticed another person walking towards him, holding a map.""Excuse me, do you know where Route 30 is?"" Kamon asked.The person nodded and handed Kamon a map. ""Sure thing. It's just down the road near the Pokemart. Here, you might find this map helpful too.""Kamon thanked the stranger and put the map away in his pocket, making a mental note to refer to it later.""See ya,"" Kamon said, waving goodbye to the stranger who had given him directions.He continued on his way, feeling grateful for the kindness of strangers and excited for the adventures that lay ahead. Before he could set off for Route 30, however, he decided to make a quick stop at the nearby Pokecentre to heal his Pokemon.As he entered the bustling center, he noticed a girl with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes standing at the counter, receiving treatment for her own Pokemon. She wore a stylish red top and a pair of blue jeans, and Kamon couldn't help but feel a twinge of admiration for her confidence and style.""Thanks,"" the girl said, smiling at the nurse behind the counter as she received her fully-healed Pokemon. She then turned to Kamon, her eyes sparkling with excitement. ""You look like a beginner,"" she said. ""Do you want to battle?""Kamon hesitated for a moment, feeling unsure of his abilities. But then he remembered the advice of his mentor, Professor Elm: ""Never turn down a battle. Win or lose, it's always a chance to learn.""""Sure, I'm up for it,"" Kamon replied with a grin. ""But I need to heal my Pokemon first.""The girl nodded understandingly. ""No problem. Meet me outside the Pokecentre when you're ready.""As the girl stepped outside, Kamon could feel his heart racing with anticipation. He quickly made his way to the healing station, making sure that his Pokemon were in top condition for the upcoming battle, placing his trusty Toto into the machine and watching as it was quickly restored to full health. Once he was satisfied that his team was ready, he stepped outside to meet his opponent, feeling a mixture of excitement and nerves as he prepared to test his skills in a real battle.""Are you ready?"" the girl asked, a sly grin spreading across her face.""I guess so,"" Kamon replied, feeling a slight twinge of nervousness in his stomach.""Well, I'm not going to go easy on you though,"" the girl said, a mischievous glint in her eye. ""I hope you're ready for a challenge.""Kamon nodded, feeling determined to give it his all. He took a deep breath and focused on the task at hand, sizing up his opponent's Pokemon as he prepared to make his move.As the battle began, the two trainers called out their first Pokemon, sending them into the fray. Kamon's Toto faced off against the girl's Pidgey, and the two Pokemon quickly began to exchange blows.Toto launched into an attack, landing a solid Scratch on Pidgey and causing it to falter. But the girl wasn't deterred, quickly calling out a command and having Pidgey unleash a barrage of Gust attacks on Toto.Kamon watched nervously as Toto took hit after hit, but he refused to give up. He called out a command of his own, having Toto use Leer to lower Pidgey's defense and gain an advantage in the fight.The girl responded with a fierce attack, having Pidgey swoop in for a quick attack that left Toto reeling. But Kamon wasn't about to give up, rallying his Pokemon with a quick healing item and urging it to keep fighting.The battle raged on, with both trainers giving it their all in a fierce display of skill and strategy. In the end, it was Kamon who emerged victorious, his Toto landing the final blow and leaving the girl's Pidgey unconscious on the ground.""Great battle,"" Kamon said, extending his hand to his opponent in a show of sportsmanship. ""You're a tough opponent.""After the intense battle with the girl, Kamon took a moment to catch his breath and collect his thoughts. As he did, the girl approached him with a smile on her face.""Hey, that was a great battle,"" she said, extending her hand. ""I'm Lyra, by the way. Nice to meet you.""Kamon shook her hand and introduced himself, feeling a sense of relief that the battle was over but also a newfound respect for his opponent. He couldn't deny that Lyra had put up a tough fight and had proven herself to be a skilled trainer.""Thanks, Lyra,"" he said. ""You were really strong out there. I'm impressed.""Lyra grinned, looking pleased with the compliment. ""I could say the same for you,"" she said. ""You've got some good Pokemon there. I bet we'll have some great battles in the future.""Kamon nodded, feeling a sense of excitement at the prospect of future battles with Lyra. He had always loved the thrill of competition, and he could tell that she shared his passion for Pokemon battles.""I hope so,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to it.""With that, the two trainers bid each other farewell and went their separate ways. As Kamon continued on his journey, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected encounter and the chance to test his skills against a worthy opponent. He knew that there would be many more battles to come, but for now, he was content with the sense of camaraderie and mutual respect that had developed between him and Lyra.Kamon decided to visit the local Poké Mart to purchase some supplies for his upcoming journey. As he browsed through the store, he noticed a new item on the shelves: a Wishing Good. Intrigued by its description, he decided to buy it and see if it could help him catch stronger Pokémon.After leaving the store, Kamon headed towards the nearby lake. He had heard that it was a great place to catch water-type Pokémon, and he was hoping to find a powerful Magikarp to add to his team. When he arrived, he carefully lowered the Wishing Good into the water and made a wish for a rare and powerful Pokémon.Suddenly, the water began to stir, and Kamon could see a shadow moving beneath the surface. With excitement building inside of him, he readied his Pokéball and waited for the creature to appear.To his surprise, a massive Magikarp suddenly leaped out of the water, splashing him with waves of cool water. It was much larger and stronger than any Magikarp he had ever seen before, and Kamon knew that this was the Pokémon he had been wishing for.Without hesitation, he threw his Pokéball and successfully caught the powerful Magikarp. He knew that with this new addition to his team, he would be able to take on even tougher opponents in his journey to become a top Pokémon trainer.As Kamon continued his journey, he spotted a wild grass-type Pokémon in a nearby clearing. He knew that this was a great opportunity to level up his newly caught Magikarp and decided to engage in battle.""Alright, Magikarp, let's do this!"" Kamon called out, releasing his Pokémon from its Pokéball. The grass-type Pokémon, a Hoppip, turned to face its opponent and prepared for the battle ahead.Kamon knew that Magikarp's weak attacks would be no match for Hoppip's agility and speed, so he decided to use a different strategy. ""Magikarp, use Splash to raise your attack!"" he commanded.Magikarp splashed around in the shallow water, and Kamon could see its confidence growing. He knew that Magikarp was building up its strength, and he waited patiently for the right moment to strike.As Hoppip lunged forward with a powerful tackle attack, Kamon shouted, ""Now, Magikarp, use Tackle!"" Magikarp, fueled by its raised attack, launched itself at Hoppip with incredible force.The impact was enough to knock Hoppip back, and it struggled to get back on its feet. Kamon saw his chance and called out, ""Magikarp, finish it off with a powerful Splash attack!""Magikarp launched itself out of the water, landing a direct hit on Hoppip and sending it flying. The grass-type Pokémon was defeated, and Kamon couldn't help but smile with satisfaction.""Great job, Magikarp! You're getting stronger with every battle,"" he exclaimed, returning his Pokémon to its Pokéball. He knew that with every battle, Magikarp would continue to grow and evolve into an even more powerful creature.",0

"1. INT. BATHILDA'S STUDY - DAY 


Albus and Gellert enter the study. Albus looks around, taking in the books and artifacts that line the walls. 



GELLERT:

 This is it. 


Albus nods, and Gellert leads him to the shelf where the book is located, and the two men begin to search for the book. After a few moments, Gellert finds it. 



GELLERT:

 Here it is. 


Albus looks at the book, and then looks at Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 So, this is what I was looking for? 


Gellert nods. 



GELLERT:

 Yes. 


Albus takes the book, and looks at Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 Thank you. 


Gellert smiles. 



GELLERT:

 It's a pleasure to meet you, Albus. 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then looks away. 



ALBUS:

 The pleasure is mine. 


The two men stand in silence for a few moments, before Gellert speaks.  



GELLERT:

 I'm sure we'll be seeing more of each other.

 I'm sure we will.

 So, what brings you here?

GELLERT:

 I'm here to learn more about magic. 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then nods. 



ALBUS:

 I see. 


The two men walk in silence for a few moments, before Albus speaks again. 



ALBUS:

 What do you think of magic? 


Gellert looks at Albus. 



GELLERT:

 I think it's a powerful force that can be used for both good and evil. 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then nods. 



ALBUS:

 I agree. 


The two men continue walking in silence, until they reach the end of the path.

GELLERT:

 This is it. 


Albus looks around, taking in the beauty of the forest. 



ALBUS:

 It's beautiful. 


Gellert smiles. 



GELLERT:

 It's the perfect place to start. 


Albus nods, and the two men sit down. 



GELLERT:

 So, tell me about your ideas. 


Albus looks at Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 I believe that we can use our magic to make the world a better place. 


Gellert nods. 



GELLERT:

 I agree. 


Albus smiles at Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 I think that we can use our power to create a better future for everyone. 


Gellert smiles. 



GELLERT:

 I think so too. 


The two men sit in silence for a few moments, before Albus speaks. 



ALBUS:

 What do you think of using force against Muggles? 


Gellert looks at Albus. 



GELLERT:

 I think it is necessary in some cases. 


Albus nods. 



ALBUS:

 What would you do if you were faced with a situation where you had to choose between sacrificing one life to save five? 


Gellert frowns. After a moment, he answers. 



GELLERT:

 I would choose to sacrifice the one life to save the five. 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then shakes his head. 



ALBUS:

 I could never make that choice. 


Gellert looks away. 



GELLERT:

 I understand. 


They fall in silence for a while, before Albus speaks again. 



ALBUS:

 We have different views on this matter. 


Gellert nods. 



GELLERT:

 Yes, we do.


Gellert turns to look at Albus. 



GELLERT:

 But I think you should consider it. 


Albus shakes his head. 



ALBUS:

 No, I can't. 


Gellert stares into Albus, and then moves a bit closer. 



GELLERT:

 Think of the greater good. Think of the five lives you could save. 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then looks away. He is silent for a few moments, before he speaks again. 



ALBUS:

 I still can't do it. 


Gellert sighs slightly. 



GELLERT

: I understand. But I think you should at least consider it. 


Albus nods. 



ALBUS:

 I will think about it. 


Gellert smiles. 



GELLERT:

 That's all I ask.

 
 
 
 


4. EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY 


Gellert merrily greets Albus as he is trotting into the clearing in the forest. Albus sits beside Gellert with a heavy book in his arms.



GELLERT:

 You must have finished it, haven't you?


Albus lowers his head and flips through the book randomly.



ALBUS:

 Not yet. I know we are supposed to discuss it this morning... Ariana haven't been too well these days. I have been spending a lot of time with my family lately. 


Gellert glances at Albus, and then looks away. He is silent for a few moments, before he speaks. 



GELLERT:

 I understand. It's important to spend time with family. 


Albus hesitates. 



ALBUS:

 It is not that you are not important to me. 


Gellert is silent for a few moments, before he speaks again. 



GELLERT:

 I'm sure they appreciate it. 


Albus looks at Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 I doesn't ask for that.


Gellert looks at Albus. 



GELLERT:

 I'm sure they're very lucky to have you. 


Albus smiles.



ALBUS:

 Thank you. 


Gellert looks away again. He notices that upon a tree, two golden birds are whipping up and down. Gellert watches them darting for a while, before he speaks again. 



GELLERT:

 I'm sure for that.


Albus moves closer to Gellert and surveys his face.



ALBUS:

 Ariana and Aberforth are still young - they need me. Does that bother you?


Gellert frowns. He thinks about it for a second. 



GELLERT:

 I didn't realize I felt this way until now. 


Albus smiles. 



ALBUS:

 I understand.


Albus looks away, watching the birds fluttering.



ALBUS:

 We've been spending a lot of time together lately. 


Gellert nods. 



GELLERT:

 Yes, we have. 


Albus looks to Gellert. 



ALBUS:

 I think we should talk about our relationship. 


Gellert casts down his eyes.



GELLERT:

 I'm not sure what you mean. 



ALBUS:

 I think we should talk about how we feel about each other. 


Gellert hesitates.



GELLERT:

 I'm not sure for that. 


Albus nods.



ALBUS:

 I understand. We don't have to talk about it now.


 Gellert looks at Albus. 



GELLERT:

 Thank you. 

 
 
 
 


5. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

GELLERT:

 I think I'm in love with Albus. 


He gazes at the shining stars.



GELLERT:

 I keep thinking about all the things we could do together. 


He notices a star in the east that is particularly bright. He speaks to himself. 



GELLERT:

 I think I'm in love with him.

 
 
 
 


6. EXT. DUMBLEDORES HOUSE - MORNING 


Gellert is running up the path to the house of Dumbledores. He is breathing heavily, and he stops in front of the house. He jumps up to the window of Albus' bedroom. He lands on the windowsill, and then knocks on the window. 



INT. DUMBLEDORES HOUSE - MORNING

 


Albus is awoken by the sound of knocking on the window. He gets out of bed, and goes to investigate. He is surprised to see Gellert standing there. 


Gellert looks at Albus, and then takes a deep breath. He speaks. 



GELLERT:

 Albus, I have something to tell you. I think I'm in love with you.


Albus looks up at Gellert with a smile. 



ALBUS:

 Gellert, I...I feel the same way. 


Gellert jumps off the windowsill, smirking at Albus with a relief.



GELLERT:

 I'm glad.

ALBUS:

 Me too.

 This is it.

Gellert takes out his wand, and holds it up. 



GELLERT:

 Are you ready? 


Albus looks at Gellert, and then nods. 



ALBUS:

 Yes. 


Gellert takes Albus' hand, and slices it open. Albus winces, but does not cry out. Gellert then takes his own hand, and slices it open. He takes Albus' hand, and presses it against his own. 



GELLERT:

 We are now bound together. 


Albus gazes at Gellert soulfully. 



ALBUS:

 Yes. 


The two men sit in silence for a few moments, before Gellert speaks. 



GELLERT:

 Let's seal this pact with something more. 


Albus waits for him to continue. 



GELLERT:

 Let's make love. 


Gellert leans over Albus, pushes him down upon the hay bale. They embrace, and kiss passionately. They make love, and afterwards lay in each other's arms.

: We are now truly bound together. 


Albus smiles, and nods. 



ALBUS:

 Yes. We are.

 
 
 
 


8. EXT. DUMBLEDORES HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

INT. DUMBLEDORES HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

 


Albus enters the house, and is surprised to see Aberforth standing there. 


Aberforth looks at Albus, and then takes a deep breath. He speaks. 



ABERFORTH:

 Albus, I'm getting tired of Grindelwald's visits. He's here way too often. 


Albus looks at Aberforth, and then sighs.



ALBUS:

 I know, Aberforth. I'm sorry. 


Aberforth pauses for a moment, and then he says. 



ABERFORTH:

 It's not just that. I'm worried about Ariana. You've been spending so much time with Grindelwald, I'm afraid she won't be taken care of when I go back to Hogwarts. 



ALBUS:

 I understand. I'll make sure she's taken care of. 



ABERFORTH:

 I'm glad to hear that. I just want to make sure she's safe. 


Albus nods.



ALBUS:

 I promise, she will be.

 
 
 
 


9. INT. GRINDELWALD'S ROOM - DAY 


Albus and Gellert are sitting at a table, discussing their plans. Gellert is looking at a map of the world, and pointing out various locations. 



GELLERT:

 We should start in Europe, and then make our way to Asia. We can search for the Deathly Hallows in each of these places. 



ALBUS:

 That sounds like a good plan. We should also make sure to visit some of the more remote locations, as they may hold the answers we are looking for. 



GELLERT:

 Agreed. We should also make sure to visit some of the magical communities, as they may have information that could help us in our search. 



ALBUS:

 Yes, that is a good idea. 


Albus and Gellert continue to discuss their plans, mapping out a route that will take them around the world in search of the Deathly Hallows.

 
 
 
 


10. INT. DUMBLEDORES HOUSE - DAY 


Aberforth is standing in the living room, looking at Albus and Gellert. He speaks. 



ABERFORTH:

 What do you think you're doing? You can't take Ariana with you! She's not in any condition to travel! 


Albus looks at Aberforth, and then sighs. He speaks. 



ALBUS:

 I know, Aberforth. But we need her help. 


Aberforth shakes his head. He speaks. 



ABERFORTH:

 You're being irresponsible, Albus. You can't just take her away like this! What help do you need? 


Albus looks away.



Albus:

 I can't tell you. 


Aberforth looks at Albus, and then frowns.



ABERFORTH:

 You don't need her help, do you? You just want to take her away because you feel responsible for her. 


Albus nods. He speaks. 



ALBUS

: Yes, I do. She needs to be looked after, and I can't do that here. 


Aberforth looks at Albus, and then shakes his head. He raises his voice.



ABERFORTH

: You CAN'T just take her away like this! 


Gellert steps over to stand beside Albus. He stares at Aberforth.



GELLERT:

 What do you think you're doing? This IS our plan! 



ABERFORTH:

 This is nonsense, Grindelwald. Albus and Ariana will NEVER go with you! 



GELLERT:

 You will not challenge me! 


Gellert's voice is filled with anger, and Aberforth can feel the tension in the room. He clenches his fists and takes a step forward, but Gellert raises his wand and points it at Aberforth. He speaks. 



GELLERT:

 DON'T YOU TRY TO STOP ALBUS.


Aberforth looks at Gellert, and then shakes his head. He takes out his wand. 



ABERFORTH:

 I'm not afraid of you! You mean, indecent and outrageous small Kraut!


Gellert scowls.



GELLERT:

 Enough! I will not be spoken to in such a manner! 


Aberforth throws a spell at Gellert's face, but Gellert wields it away.



GELLERT:

 You will regret this! 


Gellert raises his wand and casts the Cruciatus Curse on Aberforth. Aberforth screams in pain as the curse takes hold of him, and he falls to the ground writhing in agony. Albus moves to defend his brother, and a vicious three-way duel ensues. Aberforth is in immense pain, and he struggles to stay conscious.


Spells are cast back and forth, and the room is filled with the sound of explosions and flashes of light. Gellert is enraged by the challenge to his plan, and his anger fuels his magic. Albus and Aberforth fight back, but Gellert is relentless. He casts powerful spells, and they duel fiercely, their wands clashing and sparks flying. 


With the blood pact between them, they are unable to directly cast harmful spells on each other due to the blood pact, so they must rely on their wits and skill to outmaneuver each other. The duel is intense and the room is filled with smoke and debris. 


Suddenly, Ariana appears in the doorway, frightened by the scene before her. She is determined to help her brothers, and she releases a powerful Obscurial. The Obscurial is so strong that it causes the walls to shake and the furniture to fly around the room. Aberforth and Albus are forced to shield themselves from the powerful creature, and Gellert is taken aback by the strength of the magical power. 


However, the Obscurial is too powerful for Ariana to control, and it takes a toll on her. She collapses to the ground, and Albus and Aberforth rush to her side. They try to revive her, but it is too late. Ariana has succumbed to the power of the Obscurial, and she is gone. 


Gellert, realizing that he has gone too far, leaves without a word. Albus and Aberforth are left in shock, mourning the loss of their beloved sister.",0

"Chapter 1: First Day of School

 Dean nervously adjusted his leather jacket as he walked into his first day of senior year. He spotted Castiel at his locker, and his heart skipped a beat. Castiel looked as gorgeous as ever, with his messy hair and piercing blue eyes. But before Dean could say anything, a girl with short black hair sidled up to Castiel.""Hey there,"" she said, batting her eyelashes. ""I'm Meg. What's your name?""Castiel looked up from his locker, and Dean could see the confusion in his eyes. ""Um, I'm Castiel,"" he said slowly.""I'm new here,"" Meg said, smiling brightly. ""Maybe you could show me around?""Dean's heart sank as he watched Castiel nod and lead Meg down the hallway. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. But what could he do?  

Chapter 2: Late Night Chats

 That night, Dean logged onto his computer and opened up his chat program. He saw that Castiel was online, and his heart leapt. He sent a quick message: ""Hey Cas, what's up?""A minute later, Castiel responded: ""Not much, just trying to finish my English essay. What about you?""""Just thinking about stuff,"" Dean said, hesitating. Should he tell Castiel how he felt?""Is everything okay?"" Castiel asked, his concern evident.""Yeah, I guess,"" Dean said, shrugging even though Castiel couldn't see him. ""It's just... I don't know. I feel like we don't hang out as much as we used to.""""I know what you mean,"" Castiel said. ""But it's not like we can just skip school and go on adventures like we used to.""""I guess,"" Dean said, feeling frustrated.

How did Castiel know? ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" he said defensively.""It's okay if you do,"" Castiel said softly. ""I just wanted to know.""Dean took a deep breath. This was it. ""Yeah, Cas. I do. I've had feelings for you for a long time.""There was another pause, and then Castiel said, ""I think I have feelings for you too, Dean.""Dean couldn't believe it.

"Chapter Text

Edogawa Ranpo knew it was a trap when he received a message on his phone from Fyodor Dostoevsky inviting him over for a chat. The mastermind behind the Decay of Angels and the Port Mafia's subjugation was someone Ranpo did not trust. Yet, he found himself accepting the invitation and heading to the location indicated in the message.
 
As he approached the designated meeting place, Ranpo could feel his heart rate increase. He reminded himself that he was one of the best detectives in the Armed Detective Agency and that he could handle whatever Fyodor had in store for him.
 
When he arrived at the location, he saw Fyodor waiting for him. ""Welcome, Edogawa Ranpo. Thank you for accepting my invitation,"" Fyodor said, his eyes cold and calculating.
 
Ranpo put on a brave face and replied, ""Cut the pleasantries, Fyodor. I know this is a trap. So, what do you want?""
 
Fyodor's lips curled into a smirk. ""You're as smart as they say, Edogawa Ranpo. But, let's not waste any more time. I called you here to discuss a matter of utmost importance. Something that concerns the safety of Yokohama and its inhabitants.""
 
Ranpo's curiosity was piqued, but he remained cautious. ""What is it? And why should I believe anything you say?""
 
Fyodor's smirk faded, and his eyes bore into Ranpo's. ""You may not believe me now, but soon you will see that what I say is true. Come with me.""
 
Without waiting for a response, Fyodor turned and walked away, expecting Ranpo to follow him. Ranpo hesitated for a moment before following Fyodor, wondering what was waiting for him at the end of this conversation.
 
Ranpo followed Fyodor as he led the way to a hidden room in the back of the building. When they entered, Ranpo could see that the room was empty except for a single page ripped from a book lying on a pedestal in the center.
 
""This is what I wanted to show you, Edogawa Ranpo,"" Fyodor said, gesturing towards the book. ""It's called 'The Book,' and it possesses an ability that can rewrite reality into anything. It is a powerful tool that can shape the world in any way the user desires.""
 
Ranpo felt his heart drop as he realized the implications of Fyodor having a page of 'The Book'. He knew that it was a powerful ability that could alter reality to anything written on its pages. If Fyodor had even a single page, he could cause chaos and destruction on a massive scale.
 
Ranpo tried to keep his composure, but he could feel his hands shaking with fear and anger. ""How did you get that page?"" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
 
Fyodor smiled knowingly. ""That's not important. What's important is that I have it now, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.""
 
Ranpo took a step back, his mind racing with possibilities. He knew that Fyodor was a formidable opponent, and he would need help from his colleagues to stop him. But, he also knew that he couldn't let Fyodor get away with this. He had to find a way to stop him, no matter what it took.
 
""You may have a page of 'The Book', but I have something even more powerful,"" Ranpo said, his voice laced with determination. ""I have my friends, my colleagues at the Armed Detective Agency. And together, we will stop you.""

 He watched in fascination as Fyodor began to write and read out loud.
 
""Ranpo Edogawa is pregnant with Dazai Osamu's child.""
 
Ranpo felt his heart skip a beat as he heard those words. He couldn't believe what he was hearing. ""That's ridiculous,"" he said, trying to sound composed. ""How can you make something like that happen?""
 
Fyodor smiled coldly. ""With 'The Book,' anything is possible. And soon, the entire world will believe that this is true. You will have no choice but to live with the consequences of my actions.""
 
Ranpo felt a sense of dread wash over him as he realized the implications of what Fyodor had just said. He couldn't let this happen. He had to stop Fyodor before it was too late.
 
""I won't let you get away with this,"" Ranpo said, his voice firm. ""I'll find a way to stop you, no matter what it takes.""
 
Fyodor's smile widened. ""I expected nothing less from the great Edogawa Ranpo. But, do keep in mind that you're up against 'The Book' and its power. You may find it harder than you think.""
 
Ranpo gritted his teeth, determined to find a way to counteract Fyodor's plan. He knew that he couldn't do it alone, and he would need the help of his colleagues at the Armed Detective Agency. But, first, he needed to get out of this room and come up with a plan.Ranpo's mind raced as he tried to come up with a plan to stop Fyodor's nefarious scheme. But before he could say anything, Fyodor spoke up again.
 
""I see that you're worried, Edogawa Ranpo,"" Fyodor said, his voice dripping with amusement. ""But don't worry, you're not alone. I too have a stake in this game.""
 
Ranpo knew that this was just the beginning of a long and arduous battle. He had to come up with a plan, and fast. He knew that the fate of Yokohama and its inhabitants rested on his shoulders, and he couldn't let them down. He looked down at the single page that Fyodor had shown him, the words ""Ranpo Edogawa is pregnant with Dazai Osamu's child"" staring back at him. He couldn't believe what he was reading. It was absurd, ridiculous, and downright impossible.
 
He tried to shake the thought from his mind, but Fyodor's next words sent a chill down his spine.
 
""And here's the best part, Edogawa Ranpo. You won't survive the birth. But your child will be the smartest human who ever lived.""
 
Ranpo felt like he was going to be sick. The idea of being pregnant, let alone dying during childbirth, was a nightmare come true for him. He felt his knees weaken, and he sat down on the floor, staring at the page in disbelief.
 
This couldn't be happening to him. It just couldn't. He was Edogawa Ranpo, the great detective, the invincible one. How could he fall victim to something like this?
 
But deep down, he knew that Fyodor was telling the truth. He could feel the weight of the words on the page, their power and their danger. He knew that he couldn't undo it without risking the lives of his friends and colleagues at the Armed Detective Agency.
 
He stood up, his mind racing with possibilities. He had to find a way to counteract Fyodor's plan, but he couldn't do it alone. He needed help, but who could he turn to?
 
Lost and confused, Ranpo ran out of the room, not knowing where he was going. His mind was in turmoil, his emotions raw and uncontrolled. He knew that he had to face reality, but he couldn't bring himself to accept it. Not yet.
 
As he ran, he could hear Fyodor's laughter echoing in his mind, taunting him with the knowledge that he had won this round. But Ranpo refused to give up. He would find a way to stop Fyodor, no matter what it took. He just had to keep moving forward, one step at a time.Ranpo ran as fast as he could, not knowing where he was going but needing to get away from the nightmare that was Fyodor's plan. As he ran, he felt overwhelmed, scared, and alone. He couldn't believe that this was happening to him, that he was pregnant with Dazai Osamu's child, and that he was going to die during childbirth. The thought was too much to bear.
 
He slowed down to catch his breath, trying to calm his racing thoughts. He had to come up with a plan, something to counteract Fyodor's plan. But what could he do? He was just a detective with no ability, up against 'The Book' and its power.
 
He tried to use his Super Deduction ability to deduce Fyodor's plan, but his thoughts were jumbled and incoherent. He couldn't focus, couldn't think straight. He felt like he was losing his mind.
 
He sat down on a nearby bench, feeling defeated. He had always prided himself on being invincible, on being able to solve any case that came his way. But now, he was facing something that was beyond his control, something that threatened to destroy him and everything he held dear.
 
He closed his eyes and tried to calm his racing heart, but he could still feel the weight of Fyodor's words on his shoulders. He knew that he couldn't keep running forever, that he had to face reality eventually. But how could he do that? How could he accept the fact that he was pregnant, that he was going to die, and that his child would be the smartest human who ever lived?
 
He felt lost, alone, and scared. He knew that he needed help, but he didn't know who to turn to. His thoughts drifted to his colleagues at the Armed Detective Agency, but he didn't want to put them in danger. He didn't want to risk their lives on his behalf.
 
He opened his eyes and looked up at the sky, feeling a sense of hopelessness wash over him. He knew that he couldn't give up, but he didn't know how to fight back. All he could do was wait and hope that something would change, that he would find a way out of this nightmare.Ranpo had spent the entire night tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He couldn't stop thinking about Fyodor's plan and what it meant for him and his future. He was scared, overwhelmed, and in deep denial. There was no way that he could be pregnant, no way that Fyodor's words could be true.
 
But as he looked down at his stomach, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. There was something there, something that shouldn't be there. He tried to shake the thought from his mind, but it lingered like a dark cloud over his head.
 
He got up, feeling exhausted and defeated. He knew that he had to face the day ahead, that he had to go to work and pretend like everything was okay. But he didn't know how he was going to do it.
 
He got dressed and headed out, trying to keep his thoughts to himself. He didn't want anyone to know what had happened, didn't want anyone to worry about him. He was Edogawa Ranpo, after all, the great detective, the invincible one. He couldn't let anyone see him like this.
 
He arrived at the Armed Detective Agency and greeted his colleagues with a forced smile. He tried to act like everything was normal, but he knew that they could sense something was off.
 
""Good morning, Ranpo-kun,"" Atsushi said, looking at him with concern. ""Are you okay? You look tired.""
 
""I'm fine,"" Ranpo replied, trying to sound cheerful. ""Just didn't get much sleep last night.""
 
Dazai raised an eyebrow, looking at Ranpo with suspicion. ""Is there something you want to tell us, Ranpo-kun? You seem a bit off today.""
 
Ranpo's heart skipped a beat, but he tried to keep his composure. ""No, nothing like that. Just a case that's been keeping me up.""
 
Kunikida walked in, interrupting their conversation. ""Good morning, everyone. We have a new case to solve. It involves a series of robberies that have been happening around the city.""
 
Ranpo tried to focus on the case, but his mind kept drifting back to Fyodor's plan. He knew that he couldn't keep it a secret forever, but he didn't know how to tell his colleagues what had happened. He didn't want them to worry, didn't want to burden them with his problems.
 
He tried to push the thought from his mind, focusing on the case at hand. But as he looked around at his colleagues, he couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. How could he face them, knowing what was happening to him? How could he pretend like everything was okay, when it clearly wasn't?Four weeks had passed since the incident with Fyodor, but Ranpo was still in deep denial. He refused to believe that he could be pregnant, telling himself that Fyodor had made it up, that there was no way a man could get pregnant.
 
He had refused to share what was going on with his coworkers, still trying to pretend like everything was normal. But as the weeks went on, he couldn't ignore the changes happening to his body. He was getting bigger, his stomach swelling with each passing day. He tried to hide it with loose clothing, but he knew that his colleagues would start to notice eventually.
 
He walked into the agency one day, feeling self-conscious and scared. He didn't know how much longer he could keep up the charade, how much longer he could pretend like everything was okay.
 
Kunikida looked up from his paperwork, frowning when he saw Ranpo. ""What's going on, Ranpo-kun? You look pale.""
 
Ranpo tried to force a smile, but it was clear that he was struggling. ""I'm fine, just a little tired. Don't worry about me.""
 
Dazai walked in, looking at Ranpo with concern. ""Are you sure you're okay, Ranpo-kun? You've been acting strange lately.""
 
Ranpo felt his heart skip a beat, but he tried to brush it off. ""Just a little stressed out, that's all. You know how it is.""
 
Atsushi walked in, interrupting their conversation. ""Hey, guys! Check this out, I found something on the case we're working on!""
 
Ranpo felt a sense of relief wash over him, glad to have the conversation diverted away from him. But as he listened to Atsushi talk about the case, he couldn't help but feel a sense of despair. How much longer could he keep this up? How much longer could he pretend like everything was normal?
 
As the weeks went on, Ranpo continued to struggle with his denial. He tried to convince himself that everything was okay, that he wasn't really pregnant, but he knew deep down that it was a lie. He couldn't keep up the charade forever, and he knew that he had to face the truth eventually.
 
But as he looked around at his colleagues, he couldn't bring himself to tell them what was going on. He didn't want to burden them with his problems, didn't want them to worry about him. He was Edogawa Ranpo, after all, the great detective, the invincible one. How could he admit that he was vulnerable, that he was scared, and that he needed help? 
 
Ranpo's denial was shattered one morning when he woke up with morning sickness. He tried to ignore it at first, telling himself that it was just a stomach bug or something he ate, but he knew deep down that it was something more.
 
He spent the next few days in agony, trying to hide his symptoms from his coworkers. He was exhausted, nauseous, and in pain, but he refused to let anyone see him like this.
 
But as the days went on, he knew that he couldn't keep up the charade any longer. He had to face the truth, no matter how difficult it was.
 
He sat down at his desk one morning, feeling a sense of dread wash over him. He knew that he couldn't keep this a secret forever, that he had to tell his coworkers what was going on. But he also knew that he couldn't let them find out about Fyodor's plan, otherwise they would fall into his trap trying to save him. He had to face this alone.
 
He picked up a pen and a piece of paper, trying to compose his thoughts. He wrote a letter, explaining what had happened and why he had to leave. He couldn't let his coworkers see him like this, couldn't let them risk their lives trying to save him.
 
Tears streamed down his face as he wrote, feeling a sense of despair and hopelessness. He didn't want to leave, didn't want to abandon his friends, but he knew that he had no other choice.
 
He folded the letter and put it in an envelope, addressing it to Fukuzawa. He got up from his desk, feeling a sense of finality wash over him.
 
He walked out of the agency, not looking back. He didn't know where he was going, didn't know what he was going to do. But he knew that he had to face this alone, that he couldn't let anyone else get hurt because of him.
 
As he walked through the streets of Yokohama, he felt a sense of loneliness and despair. He had lost everything, his job, his friends, his sense of purpose. But he knew that he had to keep going, that he couldn't give up.
 
He walked into the sunset, not knowing what the future held. But he knew that he would face it alone, with nothing but his own strength and determination to guide him.Fukuzawa sat at his desk, staring at the letter that Ranpo had left behind. He could feel a sense of unease creeping up inside him, as he tried to process what he had just read.
 
He called for a meeting with the rest of the agency, explaining the situation to them and passing the letter around for them to read.
 
Yosano's face was one of concern, but she remained calm and composed, trying to analyze the situation from every angle. ""We have to find him,"" she said firmly. ""He wouldn't just leave without telling us something was wrong.""
 
Fukuzawa nodded in agreement, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. He had known Ranpo for a long time, and he knew that he wouldn't just leave without a good reason.
 
They spent the rest of the day trying to track down Ranpo's whereabouts, but they were unsuccessful. Fukuzawa couldn't help but worry about his former protege, wondering what could have caused him to leave so suddenly.
 
Yosano remained stoic and focused, determined to find out what had happened. She had always respected Ranpo, and she wasn't going to let him face whatever was going on alone.
 
As the days passed, Fukuzawa and the rest of the agency continued their search for Ranpo, trying to piece together any clues they could find. But they still had no idea why he had left, or where he had gone.
 
Yosano remained vigilant, trying to stay calm and collected, but the more she thought about Ranpo's letter, the more worried she became. She knew that he wouldn't just leave without a good reason, and she was determined to find out what that reason was.Atsushi and Kunikida were both visibly shocked when they heard that Ranpo had left the agency without a word. Atsushi couldn't believe it, and he kept asking Fukuzawa if they could go and look for him. Kunikida remained stoic, but he was clearly concerned as well.
 
Dazai, on the other hand, sat in his office, his mind working overtime as he tried to analyze why Ranpo might have left the agency so suddenly.
 
He had always found Ranpo to be a fascinating character, someone who he could never quite figure out. He knew that Ranpo was intelligent, but he also knew that he was a bit lazy and prone to bouts of arrogance.
 
As he sat there, staring out the window, Dazai couldn't help but wonder what had driven Ranpo to leave. He knew that something serious must have happened, something that had made Ranpo feel like he couldn't stay at the agency any longer.
 
He thought about all the possible scenarios, trying to put himself in Ranpo's shoes. He knew that Ranpo was someone who liked to solve puzzles, so he wondered if there was some sort of mystery or problem that he was trying to solve.
 
But the more he thought about it, the more he realized that he didn't have enough information to form a proper conclusion. All he knew was that Ranpo was in trouble, and that he had to find a way to help him.
 
He knew that it wasn't going to be easy, but he also knew that he had the support of the rest of the agency. He just had to figure out what was going on, and then find a way to bring Ranpo back home.Ranpo had gone into hiding, living off his savings and trying to stay under the radar. He knew that Fyodor was still out there, and that he couldn't let the agency fall into his trap.
 
As he sat alone in his apartment, Ranpo couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. He didn't know how he was going to handle being pregnant, let alone being a single parent to a child that he didn't even know if he wanted.
 
But he also knew that this child was the only chance the agency had against Fyodor. He couldn't let them fall into his trap, and he couldn't let them suffer because of him.
 
He knew that he had to keep his distance from the agency, even if it meant living in isolation for the rest of his life. He didn't want to put anyone else in danger, and he didn't want to risk Fyodor finding out where he was.
 
But even as he tried to distance himself from the agency, he couldn't help but think about them. He missed his friends, and he missed the sense of purpose that he had when he was working with them.
 
He didn't love this child yet, but he knew that he had to do everything in his power to protect it. He didn't want to bring a child into the world under these circumstances, but he also knew that he couldn't just give up and let Fyodor win.
 
As he sat there, lost in thought, Ranpo couldn't help but wonder if he had made the right decision. He knew that he had to keep the agency safe, but he also knew that he was going to have to face this alone. And that thought was almost too much to bear.The days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, but still there was no sign of Ranpo. The agency had searched high and low, but it seemed like he had disappeared without a trace.
 
Yosano was particularly worried about Ranpo's disappearance. She had always admired his intelligence and wit, and she couldn't bear the thought of him being out there, alone and in danger.
 
One day, she decided to talk to Dazai about it. She knew that he had a talent for analyzing situations and coming up with solutions, and she was hoping that he might have some insight into where Ranpo might be.
 
""Dazai, I'm worried about Ranpo,"" she said, as she walked into his office. ""We've been searching for months, but we haven't found any clues. Do you have any ideas?""
 
Dazai looked up from his paperwork, a small smile playing at the corners of his lips. ""Ah, Yosano. Always the worrier,"" he said, in his typical teasing tone.
 
Yosano frowned. ""This is serious, Dazai. We don't know where he is, or what he's doing. We need to find him.""
 
Dazai's smile faded, and he sat back in his chair, his expression turning serious. ""I know, Yosano. Believe me, I've been thinking about it too.""
 
He paused for a moment, as if considering his words carefully. ""Ranpo is a smart guy. He wouldn't just disappear without a good reason. We have to assume that he's in trouble, and that he's trying to protect us by staying away.""
 
Yosano nodded, her eyes wide with concern. ""But what can we do? We've searched everywhere. He's hidden himself too well.""
 
Dazai leaned forward, his eyes intense. ""We can't give up, Yosano. We have to keep looking. And we have to believe that we'll find him eventually.""
 
Yosano nodded again, feeling a glimmer of hope in her chest. She knew that Dazai was right. They couldn't give up on Ranpo, no matter how hard it might be to find him.
 
Ranpo sat alone in his small, dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the wall. He was lost in thought, overwhelmed by his fears and doubts. His stomach had grown considerably larger since the last time he checked, and he knew he didn't have much time left. His thoughts were jumbled and disjointed, unable to make sense of the situation he found himself in.
 
He felt a sense of impending doom, knowing that he was carrying a child that would eventually kill him. He couldn't bear the thought of leaving the world so young, without having accomplished everything he wanted to do. He didn't want to be remembered as the man who died while pregnant. It was humiliating, and he felt his pride and dignity slipping away with every passing day.
 
Ranpo tried to push his fears away, but they lingered at the back of his mind, always present, always nagging. He felt like he was in a nightmare, unable to wake up, unable to escape. He couldn't even bring himself to love the child growing inside him, knowing that it would eventually kill him. The thought was too painful to bear.
 
He tried to focus on his work, but his mind kept wandering, unable to concentrate on anything. He was constantly tired and sick, his body struggling to keep up with the changes happening inside him. He knew that he needed to do something, to find a way out of this mess, but he didn't know where to begin.
 
As the afternoon turned to evening, Ranpo sat in silence, lost in thought, the weight of his fears heavy on his chest. He knew that he needed to face this alone, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of loneliness and despair. He didn't want to die alone, but he knew that he had no choice. He could only hope that his sacrifice would be worth it, that the child he was carrying would be the key to defeating Fyodor and saving the Agency.
 
With a heavy heart, Ranpo lay down on his bed, his hand resting on his swollen stomach. He closed his eyes, trying to find some solace in the darkness, but his mind was too clouded with fear and uncertainty. He knew that he needed to stay strong, to face the challenges ahead, but he couldn't help but feel like he was already defeated.Ranpo sat at his desk, pen in hand, and stared blankly at the paper in front of him. He had been trying to write a letter to his friend, Edgar Allen Poe, but the words refused to come. He knew he had to be careful, to not reveal too much, but he also needed Poe's help. Finally, he put pen to paper and began to write.
 
""Dear Poe,
 
I hope this letter finds you well. I'm sorry for not keeping in touch lately, but things have been difficult for me. I'm sure you've heard that I've gone missing, but I'm still here, just hiding.
 
I'm writing to you because I need your help. I need a book, a special one, created with your ability. I need it to be a book where I'm the main character, where I can live out my life the way I want to, even if I'm no longer alive.
 
I know this is a big request, and I'm sorry for asking, but I need this book to be perfect. I need it to be a world where I can protect something important to me, something that I can't keep safe in this world.
 
I'm sorry for being cryptic, but I can't tell you more. Please, if you can, help me. I'll be forever grateful.
 
Sincerely,
 
Edogawa Ranpo""
 
He read over the letter, and even though it didn't reveal much, he knew that Poe would understand. Poe was a genius, just like him, and he knew how to read between the lines.
 
Ranpo took a deep breath, folded the letter, and sealed it in an envelope. He knew that he was taking a risk, but he needed this book, this world, to keep his child safe. He hoped that Poe could deliver, that he could create a world that would protect his child, even if he couldn't.Poe was sitting at his desk when the letter from Ranpo arrived. He was surprised to see it, considering that Ranpo had been missing for months now. As he opened the envelope and began to read the letter, his concern grew.
 
""Edogawa,"" he muttered to himself as he read. ""What have you gotten yourself into now?""
 
Poe knew that Ranpo was a brilliant detective, but he also knew that his friend had a tendency to get himself into trouble. He worried about what could have happened to cause Ranpo to go into hiding.
 
But as he read on, he understood why Ranpo had reached out to him. He knew that Ranpo wouldn't ask for help unless it was important. And as he read the part about creating a book where Ranpo was the main character, Poe's heart sank.
 
""Protect something important to me, something that I can't keep safe in this world,"" Poe repeated to himself. ""What could be so important?""
 
Despite his concern, Poe knew that he had to help. He took a deep breath and got to work on the book. He knew that he had to make it perfect, that he had to create a world where Ranpo could protect whatever it was that he needed to protect.
 
As he worked, he couldn't help but worry about his friend. He knew that he had to be careful, that he couldn't let anyone else know what he was doing. But he also knew that he had to help Ranpo, no matter what.
 
""Please be safe, my friend,"" Poe whispered as he continued to write. ""Please come back to us soon.""
 
Poe worked on the book day and night, pouring his heart and soul into the pages. When he was finished, he carefully packaged it up and sent it to the temporary address that Ranpo had given him.
 
After he had sent the package, Poe contacted the agency to let them know what was going on. He knew that they were all worried about Ranpo, and he hoped that the book would provide them with some answers.
 
But by the time the agency had tracked down the temporary address, it was too late. Ranpo had already run away again, taking Poe's book with him.
 
Yosano, Kunikida, and Dazai were all gathered in Fukuzawa's office, waiting for news. When the agent in charge of the investigation informed them that Ranpo was gone, they all felt a sense of hopelessness wash over them.
 
""What are we going to do now?"" Yosano asked, her voice shaking with emotion. ""We have to find him.""
 
""We will,"" Kunikida replied, his tone firm. ""We have to keep looking.""
 
Dazai was quiet, lost in thought. He couldn't shake the feeling that they were missing something, some clue that would help them find Ranpo. But he couldn't put his finger on what it was.
 
Meanwhile, Ranpo was on the run, clutching Poe's book to his chest. He knew that he couldn't stay in one place for too long, that he had to keep moving to stay ahead of Fyodor.
 
But as he flipped through the pages of the book, he felt a sense of peace wash over him. He knew that his child would be safe here, that he had done everything he could to protect them.
 
""I'm sorry,"" he whispered to himself, tears streaming down his face. ""I'm so sorry.""As the days went by, Ranpo could feel his time running out. He was now eight months pregnant, and he knew that he only had a month left to live.
 
He was scared, more scared than he had ever been in his life. He didn't want to die, didn't want to leave his child behind.
 
But as he sat alone in his hideout, he couldn't help but think about his friends at the agency. He missed them terribly, wished that he could see them one last time.
 
""I'm sorry,"" he whispered to himself, tears streaming down his face. ""I never meant to hurt you. I just wanted to protect you.""
 
But he knew that he couldn't go back, that it was too dangerous for him and his child. Fyodor was still out there, still trying to find him, and he couldn't risk leading him to the agency.
 
As the days turned into weeks, Ranpo spent most of his time reading Poe's book, losing himself in the world that had been created for him and his child. It was a beautiful world, full of wonder and magic, and he knew that his child would be happy here.
 
But despite the beauty of the book, Ranpo couldn't shake the feeling of sadness that had settled in his heart. He wished that he could have seen his friends one last time, wished that he could have said goodbye.
 
And as the final days of his life ticked away, Ranpo found solace in the pages of Poe's book, knowing that his child would be safe and loved in this magical world.
 
Ranpo sat in a dark alleyway, huddled against the wall with a burner phone in his shaking hand. He knew this would be the last time he would ever speak to his friends, the last time he would ever hear their voices.
 
He dialed the number he had memorized by heart and waited as the phone rang. Finally, someone answered.
 
""Hello?"" It was Atsushi's voice.
 
Ranpo took a deep breath, ""Hey, it's me.""
 
There was a long pause on the other end of the line before Atsushi spoke again, ""Ranpo-senpai? Where have you been? We've been looking for you everywhere.""
 
""I'm sorry, Atsushi-kun,"" Ranpo said, his voice shaky. ""I had to leave. I couldn't stay.""
 
""But why?"" Atsushi asked, concern evident in his voice.
 
""I can't tell you,"" Ranpo said, tears starting to form in his eyes. ""But I just wanted to say goodbye. You guys are the closest thing to family I have.""
 
""Ranpo-senpai,"" Atsushi said softly, ""Please tell us what's going on. We can help you.""
 
Ranpo shook his head, ""I can't. I just... I need to say goodbye.""
 
""Wait, Ranpo,"" Dazai's voice came on the line, ""We're all here. You're on speaker.""
 
Ranpo took a deep breath, ""Hey guys,"" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for everything. For accepting me, for believing in me, for being my friends. And... thank you, Fukuzawa-san, for basically adopting me.""
 
There was a moment of silence before Fukuzawa spoke, ""Ranpo, where are you?""
 
""I can't tell you that,"" Ranpo said, tears now streaming down his face. ""But please, don't try to find me. It's too dangerous.""
 
""Ranpo,"" Yosano's voice came on the line, ""What's going on? Are you okay?""
 
Ranpo took a deep breath, ""I'm... not okay. But I can't tell you why. I just... I needed to say goodbye.""
 
""Ranpo, please,"" Atsushi's voice was pleading now, ""Let us help you. We can't just let you go like this.""
 
""I'm sorry, Atsushi-kun,"" Ranpo said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""But I can't let you get hurt because of me. Please... just remember that I love you guys. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.""
 
And with that, Ranpo hung up the phone, tears streaming down his face as he clutched the burner phone tightly in his hand. He knew this was the end. The end of his life, the end of everything he had ever known. All he could do now was wait for the inevitable.As soon as Ranpo hung up, the room fell silent. No one knew what to say or do. After a few seconds, Kunikida broke the silence.
 
""Ranpo, wait. What's going on?"" he asked frantically.
 
But there was no response, just the sound of the dial tone.
 
""Ranpo, please pick up,"" Yosano pleaded into the phone.
 
Fukuzawa, who had been standing at the back of the room, finally spoke up. ""We need to find him. Now.""
 
Akiko nodded in agreement. ""I'll check the latest location we have for him.""
 
Dazai, who had been uncharacteristically silent during the call, finally spoke up. ""I'll use my connections to see if I can find him.""
 
Everyone in the room knew that Ranpo was hiding something. They just didn't know what it was. Yosano was the first to break the silence.
 
""We have to find him. He sounded like he was saying goodbye.""
 
Fukuzawa nodded grimly. ""We'll split up and search the city. Dazai, take Yosano with you. Kunikida and I will search the other parts of town.""
 
With a sense of urgency, the team split up to search for their missing friend. They knew they had to find him before it was too late. 
 
Ranpo woke up one night, feeling immense pain. He knew that his time was up. His stomach was contracting, and he knew that it was time for the baby to be born. He was alone, and fear took hold of him. He wished that he could have seen his friends one last time, wished that he could have told them about his child. As he lay there, writhing in pain, he couldn't help but think about everything he was leaving behind. He had always been a bit of a loner, but over the years, he had grown to care deeply for his colleagues at the agency. He couldn't bear the thought of leaving them behind.
 
He knew that he didn't have much time, so he mustered up all his strength and made his way to the makeshift delivery room he had set up in his hiding place. He could feel the baby coming, and he knew that he had to be strong for both of them.
 
Despite the pain, Ranpo managed to keep his wits about him. He knew what he had to do, and he was determined to do it. As he went through the final stages of labor, he couldn't help but think about the baby that he was bringing into the world. He didn't love the child yet, but he knew that he had to protect it at all costs.
 
He screamed in pain as the contractions came closer together. He knew that he didn't have much time left. He was terrified. As the contractions come faster and harder, Ranpo tries to focus on his breathing. He knows he has to be strong and finally, after what feels like an eternity, the baby arrives. It's a girl, small and fragile.
 
Ranpo takes her in his arms, marveling at how beautiful she is. He can feel his life slipping away, but he doesn't care. All he cares about is this tiny little person in his arms.
 
He names her Tsuki, after the moon. She's his moon, his light in the darkness. He knows he can't leave her in this world, not with Fyodor still out there.
 
With shaking hands, Ranpo takes the book Poe had written for him and places his daughter inside. He knows that she'll be safe there, protected from the dangers of the real world.
 
He took out the book, the one that he had been carrying with him all these months. He opened it and placed his child inside. He knew that she would be safe there, that she would be able to live a life free from the danger that he had faced.
 
As the last of his strength leaves him, Ranpo thinks of his friends one last time. He hopes that they will forgive him for leaving, for not telling them the truth about his situation. He hopes that they will remember him fondly, as he remembers them.
 
With his final breath, Ranpo whispers a goodbye to his daughter, to the world he is leaving behind, and to the friends he will never see again. And then, with one last shuddering gasp, he is gone.
 
Ranpo Edogawa, the Super Deduction Detective, was gone. But his legacy would live on in his child, Tsuki, who would be the smartest human who ever lived, just as Fyodor had written.",0
"1Wu Zixu stood on the battlefield, his eyes scanning the troops gathered before him. As the Grand Chancellor of Ng, he had seen his fair share of battles, but there was something different about this one. He could feel the tension in the air, the anticipation of the soldiers waiting to be given their orders.As he was about to speak, a woman on horseback rode up to him. She was dressed in full armor, and her long black hair flowed behind her. Wu Zixu didn't recognize her at first, but as she dismounted from her horse, he realized who she was – Princess Tengyu.“What are you doing here, Your Highness?” Wu Zixu demanded, his voice cold and unyielding.“I'm leading the troops,” Tengyu replied, her voice just as cool as Wu Zixu's. “My father appointed me as general of this army.”Wu Zixu raised an eyebrow in surprise. He had heard of Tengyu's military prowess, but he had never expected her to be leading troops in battle. Despite his initial surprise, Wu Zixu kept his composure and asked, “Are you sure you're ready for this? War is not a game.”Tengyu's eyes flashed with anger at the implication that she wasn't capable of leading troops. “I am more than capable of leading this army,” she replied, her tone icy. “My father trusted me with this task, and I will not disappoint him.”Wu Zixu could sense the tension between them, but he knew better than to argue with a princess. He gave her a curt nod before turning back to the troops and giving them their orders.As the battle raged on, Wu Zixu couldn't help but keep an eye on Tengyu. Despite her cocky attitude, he couldn't deny that she was a skilled general. He watched as she led her troops fearlessly into battle, her black hair flying behind her.After the battle was won, Wu Zixu approached Tengyu. “Your Highness fought well today,” he said, his tone surprisingly soft.Tengyu looked at him in surprise, her guard momentarily dropping. “Thank you,” she said, a hint of a smile playing on her lips.Wu Zixu couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for the young princess. Despite her arrogance, he couldn't deny that she was a skilled warrior. Perhaps she wasn't as foolish as he had initially thought.As they parted ways, Wu Zixu couldn't help but wonder what other surprises Tengyu had up her sleeve. 2The storm had hit them hard, and the once formidable army of Ng was now reduced to a ragged and bedraggled group of soldiers trudging through the muddy terrain. Wu Zixu and Tengyu, both of whom had never experienced such dire circumstances before, were leading the retreat from the front.As they trudged on, Tengyu realized that they needed to mislead the enemy to buy the main force some time to regroup. She proposed a plan to lead a small troop and stay behind to divert the enemy's attention, while the rest of the army retreated. Wu Zixu, however, was against it.“We can't afford to risk more lives,” he said, trying to reason with her.“We can't afford to let the enemy catch up to us either,” Tengyu retorted. “We need to mislead them, and this is the only way.”Their discussion quickly turned into a heated argument, with neither willing to give in. Wu Zixu felt a strange pang in his chest as he argued with her. He knew it was not the time to talk about feelings, but he couldn't shake off the thought of losing her.“We need to stick to the original plan,” Wu Zixu said, trying to bring some impersonal reason to his argument. “Retreat, regroup, and come back stronger.”Tengyu abruptly stood up from the discussion, “I am going through with my plan,” she declared, “I can't let the enemy catch up to us.”Wu Zixu watched her leave, with a sinking feeling in his gut. He knew there was no stopping her when she had made up her mind.As they retreated, the weather slowly cleared up, Tengyu and her troops were nowhere to be seen. Wu Zixu was worried sick, and he knew that he needed to keep moving. He had a job to do, and he couldn't afford to lose focus.With a heavy heart, Wu Zixu led the main force to safety, all the while thinking about Tengyu and her troops. He knew that they would have to face the enemy alone, and the thought of her being in danger made him feel uneasy.As they reached the safe zone, Wu Zixu turned back, looking for any sign of Tengyu and her troops. But there was nothing. He knew that he had to keep moving, but the worry for Tengyu was weighing heavily on his mind. 3Wu Zixu received the report that Tengyu's horse had returned alone, with an empty saddle and bloodstains. He felt his heart drop and his hands start to shake. He knew he couldn't fall apart, the army was depending on him. He took a deep breath, swallowed his emotions, and gave the order to continue the retreat.As they retreated, they encountered the old enemy. Despite Tengyu's efforts, the enemy was still too powerful. Wu Zixu felt the weight of despair creeping up on him. He knew he had to keep his calm and wits about him to honor Tengyu's sacrifice.The battlefield was gruesome and chaotic. Wu Zixu was fighting with all his might, his sword flashing in the sun. He thought of Tengyu often, and what could have been, but he forced himself to focus on the battle at hand.Days passed, and the fighting continued, with no end in sight. The soldiers were exhausted and morale was low. Wu Zixu struggled to keep them going, but he knew they couldn't give up.Finally, on the fourth day of the battle, the enemy formation disrupted from the side and rear. A small troop cut into the enemy's belly like a knife, which lead by a knight that have a head hang from their saddle.Wu Zixu saw an opportunity and maneuvered his army to cooperate with the surprise attack troop. Together, they defeated the enemy in one fell swoop.As the dust settled, Wu Zixu saw a figure knelt on the ground, supportted themselves with a sword and surrounded by enemy corpses. It was Tengyu, the realization was like a punch to his chest. She was alive but heavily wounded. Wu Zixu ran to her, tears streaming down his face. He knelt beside her and held her hand. He knew then, more than ever before, that he loved her. But he also knew that they still had a battle to win.With Tengyu's help, they regrouped and attacked the enemy from all sides. The battle was long and hard, but they emerged victorious.As the sun began to set, Wu Zixu took Tengyu in his arms, and they watched as their army celebrated their victory. They both knew that their love for each other had helped them win, but they also knew that they had a long road ahead of them. 4Wu Zixu entered Tengyu's room, holding a tray with herbs and medicine. “How are you feeling?” he asked softly.Tengyu looked up at him with tired eyes. “I'm fine,” she said, but Wu Zixu knew she was lying. She had been quiet and withdrawn ever since they returned to the capital.He sat down next to her and started to prepare the medicine. “You don't have to pretend to be strong all the time,” he said. “We all know what you did for us.”Tengyu sighed. “I know, but I just can't shake this feeling of... I don't know, guilt maybe? It's like I have this weight on my shoulders that won't go away.”Wu Zixu looked at her with concern. “What can I do to help?”Tengyu smiled weakly. “Just keep being you,” she said. “You're always so steady and reliable. It's comforting.”Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was a messenger from the court, summoning Tengyu and Wu Zixu to a meeting.As they entered the court, they could feel the tension in the air. The emissaries from the enemy country were demanding the return of their prince's missing wife, whom they claimed had been captured during the recent battle.King Helu was outraged at the demand. “There was no such marriage arrangement!” he bellowed.But the emissaries insisted that Tengyu was already married to their prince, and that she must be returned to them to ensure the peace treaty.Wu Zixu's blood boiled with anger. “These emissaries are spreading lies and rumors!” he exclaimed. “They should all be punished!”Tengyu stood up calmly, and silence fell over the court. “What the emissaries say is true,” she said.Wu Zixu felt as though the world had stopped spinning. He had no idea what Tengyu was about to say next.“But,” she said to the emissaries, “as you can see in this box, the head inside belongs to your prince.”The emissaries were stunned into silence. Tengyu continued, “Yes, you made me married to your prince. But after the first night, I killed him, drank up his blood and fed his remains to the dogs.”The court erupted into chaos. The emissaries started shouting, demanding that Tengyu be handed over to them. But Wu Zixu had had enough. With a snarl, he drew his sword and charged at the emissaries, guards and soldiers joined the fray.Tengyu stayed where she was, watching with a cool detachment as Wu Zixu cut down anyone who came near her.Eventually, the dust settled and the emissaries lay dead on the floor. King Helu looked at Tengyu with a mixture of pride and concern.“You killed a prince and brought his head back as a trophy?” he asked incredulously.Tengyu shrugged. “That's what he deserved.”“You have shown great courage and bravery, my daughter,” Helu said. “You have also proven your loyalty to your country. Ng is proud of you.”Tengyu looked relieved and grateful, but Wu Zixu could see the weight lifting off her shoulders. He knew that she would still have to live with the memories of what had happened, but for now, they had won a great victory for Ng. 5The grand banquet hall was adorned with colorful tapestries and dazzling chandeliers, and the tables were filled with exotic dishes and expensive wines. The sound of music and laughter filled the air as Tengyu stood out amongst the crowd, wearing a magnificent silk dress embroidered with gold threads. Wu Zixu was not far behind, looking dashing in his imperial robes.Despite the merriment around them, Tengyu was feeling down. Wu Zixu couldn't help but notice the worried expression on her face.“What's wrong, Tengyu?” he asked.“It's nothing,” she replied, avoiding his gaze.Wu Zixu's heart sank. He knew her well enough to know when something was troubling her.As the night wore on, Tengyu's restlessness grew until she excused herself from the banquet. Wu Zixu's heart clenched with anxiety as he watched her leave the room, the same feeling he experienced during the battle when Tengyu went missing.After a few minutes, Wu Zixu's worry took over, and he rushed out to search for Tengyu. He found her on the balcony, standing in the moonlight and gazing at the city below. Wu Zixu approached her, then he heard Tengyu spoke up.“I don't know what to do, Father,” Tengyu said, her voice heavy with emotion. “I feel like a failure for not being able to protect myself.”Helu put a comforting arm around her shoulder. “You've done more for our kingdom than any princess could ever hope to do. Your bravery has brought honor to our people.”Wu Zixu's heart burst with emotion, and he rushed in with pounding heart, “Tengyu, I... I have a proposal for you. Will you marry me?” He immediately panicked at what he had just said, and Tengyu looked at him in surprise, her eyes shining with amusement.“Did you just propose to me, Chancellor Wu?” she asked, teasingly.“I...I...yes, I did. I mean, if Your Highness would have me, of course,” Wu Zixu stammered. “I'm sorry, my lady. It's too sudden. I shouldn't have said things like that.”Tengyu looked at Wu Zixu with surprise, then a small smile appeared on her face. “Zixu, you are always so serious. I didn't know you had it in you,” she said, teasingly.Wu Zixu felt his face flush with embarrassment. “I'm sorry, my lady. That's not in accordance with etiquette,” he repeated.Tengyu chuckled softly. “It's alright, Zixu. I'm not offended. But before I answer, I need to tell you something,” she said, her eyes glistening with mischief.Wu Zixu felt his heart skip a beat. “What is it, Your Highness?” he asked, nervously.“You're cute when you panic.” she said, grinning.Wu Zixu couldn't help but smile at her playful nature. “if you would have me,” he replied, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders. “I will protect you for the rest of your life-“he started to stammer again,“what I mean is, we could be a strong team and-”Tengyu interrupted him, a small smile on her face. “I accept your proposal, Chancellor. I think we would make a great team.”“Ah, my favorite chancellor and my favorite daughter! What a joyous occasion!” Helu said, his voice full of mirth as he walked up to them.“Ng could not have a better couple to lead our kingdom forward. Congratulations to you both!”Wu Zixu and Tengyu turned to him, their hands clasped. Helu grinned at them, clapping his hands together.“Now, let us celebrate this union properly!” he said, leading them back into the banquet hall.The rest of the night was filled with revelry and joy as Wu Zixu and Tengyu's engagement was celebrated. Helu was the life of the party, telling stories and jokes and making sure everyone was having a good time.As the night came to a close, King Helu pulled Wu zixu aside and said with a smile, “You've made me a very happy man today, my friend.”Wu zixu couldn't help but grin from ear to ear, and as he looked over at Tengyu, he knew that he had found his true love and that they would live happily ever after.In the end, Tengyu and Wu Zixu were married in a grand ceremony, with King Helu presiding over the proceedings. Ng prospered under their leadership, and their love continued to blossom and thrive. The memory of Tengyu's bravery on the battlefield lived on, and she was forever celebrated as a hero of Ng.",0
"The sun was setting over the Hogwarts castle, casting a warm orange glow across the grounds. In the Gryffindor common room, the Marauders were gathered around the fireplace, chatting and joking as they always did.James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew had become fast friends since their first year at Hogwarts. They were all talented wizards, but it was their mischievous nature that had bonded them together.As they talked, Remus couldn't help but steal glances at Sirius. He had always been drawn to his friend, but he had never been able to put his feelings into words. He didn't even know if Sirius felt the same way.Sirius, on the other hand, was feeling restless. He had been noticing the way Remus looked at him, and he couldn't help but feel a strange pull towards him. He had always thought of Remus as just a friend, but now he wasn't so sure.As the night wore on, the Marauders decided to sneak out of the castle and explore the Forbidden Forest. It was dangerous, but they had always been thrill-seekers.
As they made their way through the trees, they suddenly heard a howl in the distance. Remus tensed up, recognizing the sound immediately. It was a werewolf.
""We have to leave, now,"" he said, panic in his voice.But it was too late. The werewolf had already caught their scent and was closing in fast. They ran as fast as they could, but it was no use. The werewolf was too strong.
Just when all hope seemed lost, Sirius stepped forward, wand in hand. He was determined to protect his friends, even if it meant risking his own life.As the werewolf lunged towards him, Sirius cast a spell, causing the beast to freeze in midair. He then conjured ropes, binding the creature's limbs and rendering it powerless.
Remus looked at Sirius with newfound admiration. He had never seen him so brave before. As they made their way back to the castle, Remus couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. He wanted to tell Sirius how he felt, but he didn't know how.Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Remus tried to push his feelings aside, but they only grew stronger. He found himself thinking about Sirius constantly, wondering if he felt the same way.One day, as they were studying in the library, Sirius turned to him and said, ""Remus, can I talk to you for a minute?""
Remus's heart skipped a beat. This was it. He was finally going to tell Sirius how he felt.""I know this might sound crazy,"" Sirius said, his voice shaking slightly, ""but I think I might be in love with you.""
Remus couldn't believe what he was hearing. ""Sirius, I-""But before he could finish, Sirius leaned in and kissed him. It was soft and gentle, but it sent shockwaves through Remus's body. He had never felt so alive.From that moment on, Remus and Sirius were inseparable. They spent every moment they could together, exploring the castle and the grounds, and simply enjoying each other's company.The other Marauders were a bit taken aback by their sudden relationship, but they soon grew to accept it. They were happy as long as their friends were happy.As the years went on, Remus and Sirius graduated from Hogwarts and went on to live full and happy lives together in a little flat in central London.",0
"You find yourself in the Great Library of the Clayr, surrounded by towering bookshelves that stretch up to the vaulted ceiling. The air is cool and musty, filled with the smell of old paper and ink. The only light comes from the flickering torches on the walls, casting long shadows across the shelves. You feel a sense of anticipation as you prepare to embark on your journey.
[Oops! I missed that there should be Charter Marks for light, not torches. I'm too lazy to re-number my errors, though, so this will be zero.]I give a stack of books to Tad, the sending that shelves books concerning Traveler’s Tales, A-D.
You turn to Tad, the sending who works in the Great Library, and hand him a stack of books from the shelves concerning Traveler’s Tales, A-D. Tad nods and takes the books from you, adding them to the cart he is pushing.

“Thank you, Lirael,” he says with a smile. “I’ll make sure these are shelved correctly.”

 
As Tad pushes the cart down one of the aisles, you notice a faint glimmer of light coming from a book on one of the shelves. It looks like it might be important.
[Errors 1 & 2: sendings don’t talk and are genderfluid/nonbinary. But I didn’t correct the system yet, especially since I forgot about the gender issue.]I walk over to the book and test the Charter Marks flowing over the cover.
You walk over to the book on the shelf, and as you get closer, you can see that it is bound in leather with intricate Charter Marks flowing over the cover. You reach out and touch one of the Marks, feeling its power course through your fingertips.

As you do so, the book begins to glow with a soft blue light, and you can feel the presence of a powerful magic. This is no ordinary book, but a powerful artifact of the Old Kingdom.
I set my emergency mouse on the floor in case I need to summon a rescue, take the book in my hands and open it.
You quickly set your emergency mouse on the floor next to you in case you need to summon a rescue and then take the book in your hands. The cover feels cool and smooth to the touch, and as you open it, you see that it is filled with dense, ancient text written in a language that you don’t recognize.

As you begin to read, the words seem to come to life on the page, and you can feel the power of the Charter flowing through the book and into you. You realize that you have stumbled upon a powerful spellbook, containing knowledge and magic that could be of great use to you in your journey.
I decide to hide the book in my study so none of the other librarians will find it and go to take the Disreputable Dog for her afternoon walk.
You close the spellbook carefully and tuck it under your arm, determined to keep it safe and secret. You know that some of the other librarians might not understand the power that the book holds and might try to take it away from you.

As you make your way out of the library, you spot the Disreputable Dog waiting for you by the entrance. She wags her tail eagerly as you approach, and you smile, feeling grateful for her company on this long journey.

You clip on her leash and head out into the snowy landscape surrounding the glacier, enjoying the crisp air and the beauty of the northern wilderness.

Where do you want to go for your walk?
[Error 3: I totally missed that the Dog shouldn’t be waiting by the door, at least without Lirael scolding her! Oops! And I don’t think she’s ever worn a leash, has she?]We start off toward the mountain called Sunfall and I start to tell the Disreputable Dog about the spellbook I found.
You and the Disreputable Dog head off toward the mountain called Sunfall, with the spellbook safely tucked under your arm. As you walk, you start to tell the dog about the powerful magic contained within the book and the potential it holds for your journey.

The Disreputable Dog listens attentively, her ears perked up and her tail wagging in excitement. She seems to sense the power of the Charter Magic and the importance of the book, and you feel grateful to have her as your companion on this journey.

As you walk, you begin to notice that the sky is growing darker and more ominous, with clouds gathering overhead. You sense that a storm may be approaching, and you start to feel a sense of urgency to find shelter before it hits.
[Error 4: I left the book locked in my study! What’s it doing under my arm? And why didn’t I correct the system on this?]The Disreputable Dog and I head up the mountain toward a Ranger watchtower that is about three hundred yards ahead. It hasn’t been staffed since King Touchstone took the throne because the Old Kingdom has been safe enough to not need it. [I wanted to write his given name, Torrigan, but also didn’t want to confuse the system.]
You and the Disreputable Dog make your way up the mountain towards the Ranger watchtower, which is about three hundred yards ahead. The tower has been abandoned since King Touchstone took the throne, as the Old Kingdom has been relatively safe and the Rangers have not needed to maintain a constant watch.

As you approach the tower, you notice that the storm clouds are getting closer and the wind is starting to pick up. You quicken your pace, hoping to reach the tower before the storm hits.

When you arrive at the tower, you find that the door is locked. However, you are able to use your Charter Magic to pick the lock and gain entry.

Inside, you find a small but sturdy shelter, with a fire pit in the center of the room and a stack of firewood nearby. You quickly light a fire and settle in for the storm, feeling grateful for the shelter and the warmth.
[Error 5: Why didn’t I question how there’s a nice pile of wood and kindling in a room on the ground floor of a tower that’s been abandoned for 15-20 years?]The Disreputable Dog asks me to find her a snack, and as I look for some jerky, she tells me she has a bad feeling about the spellbook.[She was excited about the spellbook at the beginning of the walk. My two-second brain forgot that in its struggle to figure out where to pilot the story.]
As you begin to settle in for the storm, the Disreputable Dog nudges your hand with her nose, asking for a snack. You rummage through your pack and find some jerky, which you offer to her.

As she munches on the jerky, the Disreputable Dog looks up at you with a serious expression. “Lirael, I have a bad feeling about that spellbook,” she says. “I sense a dark power within it, and I worry that it could be dangerous in the wrong hands.”

You pause, considering her words. The Disreputable Dog has a powerful intuition and a deep connection to the Charter Magic, and you know that she is not one to be ignored.
“But what if it has the power to wake the Sight within me?” I ask. “I can finally join the Nine Day Watch and become a real Clayr!”[If we’re back in the Library, I’m bringing out the old complaint. Might as well milk it some more!]
The Disreputable Dog looks at you thoughtfully, her tail wagging slowly. “I understand your desire to awaken the Sight within you, Lirael,” she says. “But the power of the spellbook is not to be taken lightly. It could lead you down a dangerous path if you're not careful.”

You consider her words, knowing that she speaks from a place of wisdom and experience. You feel torn between your desire to awaken the Sight and your fear of the dark power contained within the book.

Suddenly, a bolt of lightning illuminates the sky outside, followed by a loud clap of thunder. The storm has arrived, and it seems that you will be trapped in the tower for some time.
I jump in fright and clutch the Disreputable Dog for comfort. After a moment, I say, “If the book is infused with Charter Magic, how can it be bad? I thought only Free Magic was bad, and Free Magic is inimical to the Charter.”[Look, I included Garth’s favorite word! And I’m struggling, because that was a lame sentence.]
The Disreputable Dog nuzzles into your side, offering you comfort as you jump in fright at the sound of thunder. “You are correct that Free Magic is inimical to the Charter, Lirael,” she says. “But not all magic that is infused with Charter Magic is necessarily good. There are many things in the world that are neither wholly good nor wholly bad, and the spellbook may be one of them.”

She pauses for a moment, her eyes bright with intensity. “You must remember that the Charter is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or for ill. It is up to us to choose how we use it, and we must be careful not to be seduced by the power it offers.”

Another bolt of lightning illuminates the sky outside, followed by a deafening clap of thunder. The storm seems to be getting worse, and you begin to feel uneasy.
I’m startled by a knock at the door. “Who is it?” I call in a tremulous voice.[From old complaints to clichés!]
You jump at the sudden knock on the door, and your heart races as you call out in a tremulous voice, “Who is it?”

There is no answer, only the sound of the storm raging outside. You look over at the Disreputable Dog, who cocks her head and listens intently.

After a few moments of tense silence, there is another knock at the door. This time, it is more insistent, and you can hear the sound of someone shouting over the wind.

“Open up, in the name of the King!” the voice calls out.

You feel a wave of relief wash over you as you realize that it must be one of the King’s Rangers. You hurry over to the door and unbolt it, swinging it open to reveal a drenched and bedraggled Ranger standing on the doorstep.

“What brings you up here in the middle of a storm?” you ask, ushering him inside.

“I bring urgent news from the King,” he says, his voice grave. “There have been reports of Free Magic activity in the northern reaches of the Old Kingdom. The Abhorsen has been called away to investigate, and the King has ordered all Rangers to be on high alert.”

You feel a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach as the Ranger speaks. The Abhorsen is the most powerful Charter Mage in the Old Kingdom, and if there is Free Magic activity afoot, it can only mean trouble.
[Error 6: I finally stopped and filed a complaint with the system, as the Rangers belong to the Clayr, not to the King. I told it that if there was an emissary from the King, it would likely be a Royal Guard. I also think it’s weird that a Guard would’ve just wandered up to any old watchtower on the Glacier rather than going to the designated meeting point for such messengers, but I didn’t think to point that out.]“I’m sorry, but I’m not with the Clayr’s Ranger patrol,” I apologize. “You’ll have to wait for the storm to pass before you can ask someone in the Lower Refectory to contact the Nine Day Watch for help.”
The Ranger looks at you incredulously. “You mean to tell me that you're not even a Ranger? What are you doing up here on your own then?”

You explain to him about your job as an assistant librarian and how you had taken the Disreputable Dog for a walk to get some fresh air. You also tell him about the strange spellbook that you found and how the Disreputable Dog had warned you about its potential danger.

The Ranger listens intently to your story, his expression growing more serious with each passing moment. When you finish, he nods thoughtfully.

“It sounds like you've stumbled onto something potentially dangerous, Lirael,” he says. “I would advise you to take that book back to the library and have it examined by someone who knows more about such things.”

He looks out the window at the raging storm outside. “As for me, I suppose I’ll have to wait here until the storm passes. I don’t relish the idea of trying to navigate this mountain in the middle of a tempest.”

You nod in agreement, and together you and the Disreputable Dog settle in for a long wait.
I stopped the story and complained again, because…Error 7: Lirael wouldn’t tell anyone about the Dog. Ever. (Her Great Aunt Filris being the exception.) The Dog would’ve disappeared as soon as Lirael began to unbolt the door.Error 8: She definitely wouldn’t tell anybody not of the Clayr about the spellbook, because she’s shy and she wouldn’t want to betray the Chief’s trust. (That’s the issue I actually complained about.)Error 9: At no point did Lirael ever tell the Guard her name, though if I hadn’t been annoyed and slightly bored by that point, I might have caught on and made my next prompt something like, “How did you know my name?”",0

"Chapter Text
Loki sat in the dimly lit bar, nursing a drink as he contemplated his next move. He had been on Earth for weeks now, but he was no closer to achieving his goals than when he first arrived.He knew that he needed help, and he knew just the person to ask. Tony Stark, the genius inventor, had resources that Loki could only dream of, and he knew that if he could convince Tony to work with him, they could achieve great things together.But convincing Tony would not be easy. The two had a long history of animosity, and Tony would not be quick to trust him.As Loki pondered his next move, he noticed a man sitting at the bar beside him. The man was middle-aged, with a gruff demeanor and a weathered face.Loki turned to him. ""Do you believe in fate?"" he asked, his voice low.The man looked at him skeptically. ""What do you mean?""""I mean, do you believe that some things are meant to happen?"" Loki asked, taking a sip of his drink.The man shrugged. ""I don't know about all that. But I do believe in making your own luck.""Loki smirked. ""I like that. Tell me, what would you do if you needed someone's help, but they wouldn't give it to you?""The man raised an eyebrow. ""Depends on who it is.""Loki leaned in closer. ""What if it was someone you had a history with? Someone who didn't trust you?""The man took a sip of his drink before responding. ""I'd make them an offer they couldn't refuse.""Loki grinned. ""That's exactly what I had in mind.""The man looked at him curiously. ""What's in it for me?""Loki leaned back, considering the question. ""You can be my go-between. You can help me make my case to this person. In return, I'll make it worth your while.""The man smirked. ""I like the sound of that. Who's the mark?""""Loki,"" a voice interrupted. Loki turned to see Tony Stark standing behind him, his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.Loki stood, his heart racing. He had not expected Tony to find him so easily.""Tony,"" he said, his voice calm. ""What brings you here?""""I could ask you the same thing,"" Tony replied, his eyes narrowing. ""What are you doing on Earth? And what are you up to?""Loki took a deep breath, his mind racing. He knew that he needed to be careful with his words, that one wrong move could ruin everything.""I'm here on official Asgardian business,"" he said, his voice steady. ""And as for what I'm up to, well, that's my business, isn't it?""Tony's eyes flickered with suspicion. ""I don't trust you, Loki. And I never will. You have a history of deceit and betrayal, and I have no reason to believe that you've changed.""Loki felt a twinge of anger at Tony's words, but he pushed it down. He knew that he needed to keep his emotions in check if he was going to make this work.""Tony, I understand your skepticism,"" he said, his voice calm. ""But I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm here to ask for your help.""Tony scoffed. ""You want my help? You must be desperate.""Loki resisted the urge to lash out. Instead, he took a deep breath and forced himself to stay calm.""I am desperate,"" he said. ""But that's because I know that you're the only one who can help me.""Tony raised an eyebrow. ""And why should I help you? What's in it for me?""Loki took a step closer to Tony, his eyes locking onto his. ""Because if you do, I can help you achieve something that you've always wanted. Something that no one else can give you.""Tony's eyes narrowed. ""And what's that?""""Power,"" Loki said simply.Tony's eyes widened in surprise. ""What kind of power?""""The kind of power that comes with having access to Asgardian technology,"" Loki said, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. ""The kind of power that could change the world.""Tony considered his words for a moment, his mind racing with the possibilities. As much as he hated to admit it, he knew that he was intrigued.""What kind of help do you need?"" he asked finally.Loki's smile grew wider. ""I need your resources. Your technology. Your genius mind. With your help, we can achieve great things. We can change the world.""Tony crossed his arms, his eyes still narrowed. ""And what's in it for you? Why do you need my help?""Loki's smile faded slightly, and he looked away for a moment before turning back to Tony.""I need your help to redeem myself,"" he said softly. ""I know that I've done terrible things in the past. But I want to make things right. And I know that with your help, I can do that.""Tony looked at him skeptically. ""And why should I believe you? How do I know that you won't just stab me in the back like you have so many others?""Loki's eyes met Tony's, and for a moment, Tony could see the sincerity in his gaze.""I give you my word,"" he said, his voice steady. ""I will not betray you. Not this time.""Tony considered his words for a moment, his mind racing with the possibilities. He knew that he was taking a huge risk by agreeing to help Loki, but he also knew that the rewards could be great.""Alright,"" he said finally, his voice firm. ""I'll help you. But on one condition.""Loki raised an eyebrow. ""And what's that?""""That you tell me everything,"" Tony said. ""No secrets. No lies. If we're going to work together, we need to be honest with each other.""Loki nodded. ""Agreed.""And with that, the two shook hands, sealing the deal that would change their lives forever.",0

He had thought his days of playing the sport were over, but being able to join a college team was a dream come true. However, he was not prepared for the intense rivalry that existed between his team and the unbeatable team, the Ravens, or for the enigmatic captain of the Foxes, Andrew Minyard.

"Dear diary,I don't know how I got here, but I'm trapped in the Minecraft Overworld. I was supposed to come home from Titan, but something went wrong with the portal, and I ended up here.At first, I was worried about how I would survive without my Iron Man armor, but it turns out that I can harvest resources and build things just like in the game. I quickly started to gather wood and make a shelter for myself, so I wouldn't have to sleep out in the open.As I started to explore this new world, I realized that there were dangers lurking around every corner. Creepers, zombies, and skeletons were all around, and I had to be careful not to get too close to them. I also had to watch out for falling from high places, as there were no thrusters to catch me here.Despite the dangers, I found myself enjoying this new challenge. It was like being in a survival game, and I had to use all my skills to stay alive. I crafted tools, weapons, and armor to protect myself, and I started to explore the caves to find valuable resources like diamonds and gold.However, as the days passed, I began to feel increasingly lonely. There was no one to talk to, and the villagers I had encountered didn't seem interested in conversation. I missed Pepper, Happy, and even JARVIS. I longed for the sound of another human voice.One day, I had a near-death experience. I was exploring a cave when I fell into a pit of lava. I had no water to douse the flames, and I was quickly losing health. I thought it was the end for me, but I managed to dig into the wall and avoid the lava's deadly grasp.It was a close call, and it made me realize how alone I was in this world. I had no one to share my experiences with, no one to help me when I was in trouble.Days turned into weeks, and I was still stuck in the Overworld. I had built a farm to grow food, and I had a mine where I could find valuable resources. I had even found a village where I could trade for supplies, but I still felt lonely.I refused to give up, though. I continued to explore, gather resources, and build, hoping that one day I would find a way back to Earth. Until then, I'll keep surviving in this strange new world, hoping that someone or something will come along to ease the loneliness.Tony Stark.
***Dear diary,I've been trying to build a portal to Earth, but it's not going well. I've used obsidian and flint and steel, just like in the game, but nothing seems to work.I'm not sure why it's not working. Maybe the portal needs a specific amount of obsidian, or maybe I'm missing some key ingredient. I've tried everything I can think of, but nothing seems to be working.In the process of trying to build the portal, I got hurt. I was trying to mine some obsidian when I was attacked by a group of zombies. They caught me off guard, and I didn't have my armor on at the time. I managed to fend them off with my sword, but I took some serious damage.I had to retreat to my shelter to heal, and I've been resting for a few days. It's given me some time to think about what went wrong with the portal. Maybe I need to find a rare resource that's only found in the Overworld. Maybe I need to use a different combination of materials.Either way, I won't give up. I need to find a way back to Earth, and I'm determined to make it happen. I just need to be more careful in the future and not let my guard down.In the meantime, I'll focus on healing and gathering resources. Maybe I'll stumble upon something that will give me a clue as to how to build the portal. I won't give up hope yet.Tony Stark.
***Dear diary,I'm facing a new problem now, and it's a serious one. My arc reactor is starting to deplete, and I'm not sure how much longer I have until it runs out of power completely.I've been using the arc reactor to power my tools and weapons, and to keep myself warm at night. But it's draining quickly, and I don't have the means to recharge it in the Overworld.I need to find a way to get back to Earth before the power runs out completely. If it does, my heart will fail, and I'll be stuck here forever. I can't let that happen.I've been searching for clues on how to build a portal to Earth, but nothing has worked so far. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever make it back. The loneliness is starting to get to me, and I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.But I can't give up. I need to keep trying. Maybe there's something I haven't thought of yet, some rare resource or material that I need to find. Or maybe I just need to keep trying different combinations of materials until something works.In the meantime, I'm conserving my arc reactor's power as much as possible. I'm only using it when I absolutely have to. I'm hoping that will buy me some time, but I'm not sure how much.I'm scared, diary. I don't want to die here alone in the Overworld. I need to find a way back to Earth, and I need to do it soon.Tony Stark.
***Dear diary,I'm not feeling well. The arc reactor power is getting dangerously low, and I'm starting to feel weak. I don't know how much longer I have.If anyone ever finds this diary, I want to leave a message for Pepper. Pepper, if you're reading this, I want you to know that I love you. You've always been my rock, my support, my everything. I'm sorry I didn't make it back. I wanted to come home to you, to be with you again. But it seems like that's not going to happen.I don't want you to mourn me forever, Pepper. I want you to live your life to the fullest, to be happy and fulfilled. You deserve that more than anyone I know. You've always been there for me, and I want you to know how much that's meant to me.If you ever find a way to the Overworld, please come and find me.

His arc reactor power is low, and he won't be able to survive much longer in the Overworld. I know he wanted to go back to Earth, but I'm not sure if that's the best course of action.I've been trying to heal him with potions, but his condition seems to be worsening. I'm not sure if it's too late, but I'm not giving up yet.

"Chapter Text
The busy capital of Enngstan was bathed in a beautiful orange glow as the sun slowly set over the city. Nytlan Hargrave, the grand chancellor, stood on top of the palace wall, watching the soldiers drilling in the courtyard, while Princess Izel commanded the troops below. As the light began to fade, his white hair shone in the remaining light, giving him an almost ethereal quality.""Ah, my dear chancellor,"" a voice rang out behind him, ""I’d thought we had a new statue installed on the palace wall.""He turned to see King Arvidi, who seemed relaxed today, his emerald green eyes sparkling.""It seems you were admiring my daughter once again,"" he said with a sly smile. ""It's been a while. I almost missed this scene.""Nytlan Hargrave had become used to King Arvidi teasing him about his crush on the princess, and would no longer blush like he did in his younger years. ""Your Majesty,"" he bowed to the king. ""I heard Princess Izel calmed the conflict with Kaal-muri when I was still at the Yal River. She would become a great leader.""Although renowned for her beauty and military prowess, Nytlan knew that he could never act on his feelings for Princess Izel. It was dangerous enough due to his position as the grand chancellor, not to mention Princess Izel was dangerous in her own way. As Arvidi's favorite child, the princess had a reputation of collecting many lovers over the years, and there were even rumors circulating about a complex relationship between the king and his daughter. But out of loyalty to Arvidi, Nytlan never dared to inquire.""She has inherited my talents in that area, I'm proud to say,"" the king chuckled. ""But I can see that your admiration goes beyond her martial skills.""The king stood next to him. As they watched together, the princess was driving her chariot through the ranks of soldiers. Her hair fluttered in the breeze, and her armor shone in the setting sun. They could hear her bright voice even from the palace wall.""Tell me about the Yal River,"" the king said. ""Your project withstood a flash flood from Mount Shagu, which was Enngstan's first, and effectively dispelled many doubts among the old nobles.""Nytlan began to explain as the king listened attentively, nodding along. Despite his reputation for debauchery, King Arvidi was a wise ruler who had brought justice and prosperity to Enngstan after a long period of internal conflict. Nytlan admired him greatly for that. In the glow of the sunset, Arvidi stood tall beside him, his sharp nose and jawline accentuated by the warm hue. He had delicate features, like his daughter, with chestnut hair resembling the morning dust and green eyes shining like jewels. The beauty of the Kal'Sarpen family was a sight to behold amidst the desert landscape.""Excellent. I'm looking forward to the Yal River irrigation project freeing Yalham from the fate of flooding and drought. Will you return to Yalham?"" the king asked. When he turned to Nytlan, his emerald eyes gazed into him, and Nytlan felt his heart skip a beat. Standing so close, Arvidi's shimmering eyes seemed to be able to capture souls.""After the Frost Festival,"" Nytlan said, his heart pounding. As the Grand Chancellor, he shouldn't be swayed by the king so easily, but he couldn't help it. ""I will monitor the project during the spring flood.""""Dangerous and arduous, but I expect nothing less from you,"" Arvidi said, fondly patting his shoulder. ""There is no one else who could do it as well as you. The gift that Chashan discarded now belongs to Enngstan. Once we stabilize the Yalham Plain, we can focus our efforts on Chashan. I will never forget my promise to you.""Yes, his revenge, for the house of Hargrave.But with King Suliiman being killed by his own compatriots years ago, his revenge now seemed like a distant echo amidst the vibrant streets and white rooftops of Enngstan. He had been alone for so many years as the mandate remained, but sometimes he felt himself melting into the soft voice of Enngstan's streets and alleys.""I serve you and Enngstan with all my heart and soul,"" he said, bowing his head.""Good,"" King Arvidi said with a smile. ""I have some other things to discuss with you.""""I'm all here for you, Your Majesty,"" Nytlan replied.""Not here, my dear chancellor,"" The king's grin widened. ""Come to my palace tonight, and we'll discuss.""As King Arvidi departed, the setting sun cast a golden glow upon his silhouette. Nytlan couldn't help but observe that the king possessed a slim, muscular frame and graceful mannerisms, which were nearly identical to those of Princess Izel, who remained in the training yard below. Nytlan could only deduce that their shared familial ties were responsible for their beauty, intelligence, as well as their debauchery.

 
""The King is expecting you, Grand Chancellor,"" the guard said, bowing deeply.
The palace was a magnificent and majestic structure adorned with intricate carvings and sparkling pillars that glimmered in the candlelight. The walls were decorated with intricate murals depicting great battles and heroes of Enngstan's past. Nytlan walked down the long palace corridor, his footsteps echoing against the marble floor. In the grand hall, he heard laughter and music emanating from within, some of the courtiers and nobles who were enjoying the palace's pleasures.
""Well, well, isn't this the Grand Chancellor,"" a deep voice sounded behind him.
Nytlan turned to see Prince Falhmir, Arvidi's younger brother, leaning against the wall with a smug expression on his face.
""What brings you to this part of the palace?"" Falhmir asked, crossing his arms over his broad chest.
Despite having the same chestnut hair and green eyes, the prince's sharp and rugged features gave him a wild handsomeness that was a stark contrast to the grace of the King and Princess. Although Arvidi doted on his younger brother, Nytlan had never warmed up to Falhmir as he always felt that something was amiss about him.
“Prince Falhmir,” Nylan kept his expression neutral as he responded, “I am meeting with the king to discuss state matters. Is there any problem?”
Falhmir chuckled. “State matters? Is that what they're calling it these days? I heard Arvidi has taken quite a liking to you, Nytlan. I didn't know you swung that way.”
Nytlan decided not to rise up to the prince's insinuations. ""Serving the King with loyalty is my honor,"" he said.
""Serving the King in his private chambers. That is quite the loyalty,"" Falhmir smirked. ""Will the princess be there too? I've heard they like doing things together.""
""Your Highness,"" Nytlan narrowed his eyes. ""As a member of the royal family, it's unbecoming of you to indulge in baseless rumors.""
""Rumors, huh?"" Falhmir shrugged nonchalantly. ""Just saying what I heard. I don't know about you, but doesn't the idea of the king with the princess sound quite...exciting? If only I had the chance.""
Nytlan's jaw tightened. ""You should be careful with your words, Falhmir. They are your family, and I will not tolerate any disrespect towards the King or Princess Izel.""
""Oh, I'm sorry,"" Falhmir said mockingly. ""I forgot about your shining loyalty to my brother. Don't worry, Grand Chancellor, I won't tell anyone about your little crush on him.""
“I have more important matters to attend to. If you'll excuse me, your Highness,” Nytlan brusquely ended the conversation, turning and walking away.
“Suit yourself,” he heard Falhmir laugh behind him, “I would hate to see you become their next victim.”



 
Despite his many years of service to King Arvidi, Nytlan had never been summoned to the King's private chambers before. As he entered the dimly lit room, he caught the scent of sandalwood and wintersweet wafting through the air. King Arvidi sat on a cushioned bench, holding a glass of red wine. He was dressed in a red silk robe with gold threads, and a jade belt was wrapped around his narrow waist. Nytlan couldn't help but notice how good Arvidi looked.
To his surprise, Princess Izel was also present, and the two were chatting softly in low voices. She had worn an exquisite silk dress, which differed from her usual military attire. The soft fabric accentuated her curves as she reclined on a nearby pillow next to Arvidi. Despite her relaxed demeanor, she looked as regal and fierce as ever. As Nytlan walked in, she looked up, gave him a faint smile, and her eyes sparkled in the dim light.
“Welcome, my friend,” King Arvidi said, beckoning Nytlan forward. “Please, have a seat and join us.”
As they conversed about the most recent political updates, Nytlan was captivated by Arvidi's strategic thinking and his aptitude to lead the nation towards prosperity despite the constant peril of war with the neighboring Chashan state. He couldn't help but recognize the stunning beauty of King Arvidi and Princess Izel and how effortlessly they engaged in witty banter. Even though he knew of their familial connection, he couldn't help but feel like an outsider in their close relationship, which left him with a sense of yearning.
But the night wore on, Arvidi's demeanor began to change. His eyes brighter, he became more flirtatious, making subtle comments about his looks and intelligence. ""You are quite handsome, Grand Chancellor,"" Arvidi said playfully, ""always a pleasant sight in my court."" Nytlan blushed at the praise, yet was also confused by the sudden change in the king's behavior.
He didn't wait long until Arvidi poured him another cup of wine and leaned in close.
“I have something to discuss with you, my dear chancellor,” he said, his voice low and smooth. “Something that I think will interest you.”
Nytlan's heart skipped a beat. Falhmir's words suddenly rang in his ears. However, instead of feeling disapproval, he found himself rather filled with trepidation.
“What is it, Your Majesty?” he asked, trying his best to keep his voice steady.
Arvidi took a sip of his wine, his eyes sparkling with mischief. “Well, Nytlan, I've noticed that you've been quite taken with my daughter lately. I must say, I can't blame you. Izel is quite a catch, isn't she?”
Nytlan shifted in his seat and cleared his throat. ""Your Majesty, I want to assure you that my feelings towards Princess Izel are solely professional,"" he said automatically.
Arvidi chuckled. “Oh, come now, Nytlan. You don't have to hide your feelings from me. I can see it in your eyes when you look at her. And I must say, I find it quite endearing.”
Feeling Izel's heated gaze burning into him, Nytlan tried to steer the conversation away from where he suspected it was heading. “Your Majesty, with all due respect, I do not think it would be wise for me to pursue a relationship with Princess Izel.”
Arvidi leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a whisper. “And why not, my dear Nytlan? Are you afraid of what the court might say? Or perhaps you fear that it might affect your standing as grand chancellor?”
Taking a deep breath, Nytlan tried to steady his nerves. “I am afraid of nothing, Your Majesty. But I do believe that it is not appropriate for a man of my station to engage in such a relationship with a member of the royal family.”
Izel laughed, her voice ringing like a silver bell that made Nytlan's belly flutter.
Arvidi raised an eyebrow, a sly smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “Is that so? And yet, here you are, drinking with us and speaking of your feelings for my daughter.”
He felt his face flush with embarrassment, as he had not expected the king to be so perceptive, nor had he expected him to be so forward about the subject.
“Your Majesty, I—” But before he could finish, Arvidi leaned in and pressed his lips to Nytlan's in a sudden, passionate kiss. Nytlan gasped in surprise, but before he could pull away, Arvidi deepened the kiss, his hands tangling in Nytlan's hair.
As they parted, Nytlan was left breathless and shocked, while King Arvidi sported a devilish grin and turned to his daughter Izel. “What say you, my blood?” he asked. “Doesn't our chancellor look positively dashing when he's in love?”
Izel shook her head with amusement. “Father, you are shameless,” she said, a hint of humor in her voice. “But I have to agree, Nytlan seems much more alive when he's with you.”
She then turned to Nytlan, her expression turning sly. “Don't let Father's charm distract you too much, Chancellor,” she warned, a hint of playfulness in her voice. “We still need you to lead our troops to victory.”
Returning her attention to her father, she added, “And please do try not to make him too lovestruck, Father. We need him focused on matters of state.”
King Arvidi chuckled heartily. “Don't worry, my dear,” he said, patting Izel's shoulder fondly. “I won't let my personal affairs interfere with the state's matters. Now, why don't you attend to some of your duties? Nytlan and I have some matters to discuss.”
Izel gave a nod and a knowing smile before departing the room, leaving the two men alone to confer.
“Now, my dear Nytlan,” Arvidi began, pouring them each a cup of wine as the door to the King's chamber closed, “we are alone now, and I want you to feel free to be yourself with me.”
Nytlan felt nervous as he found himself alone with King Arvidi, the very person he had admired for many years. However, he couldn't deny that the anticipation of being intimate with the King sent a rush of adrenaline through his body.
“You have my utmost admiration, Nytlan. Your loyalty, intelligence, and courage are unmatched,” the king placed a hand on his cheek, his eyes sparkling. “And I know that you admire me just as much.”
Nytlan couldn't help but shiver at the touch of Arvidi's hand.
“My king,” he tried, feeling sanity slipping away as Arvidi caressed his cheek slowly, “...I met Prince Falhmir on my way here.”
King Arvidi paused for a brief moment before giving out a soft laughter. “My lovely little brother,” he said with amusement, “he always wants what I have.”
His intense gaze fixed on Nytlan.
“But this time, it's you,” he said.
As Arvidi moved his hand to his knee, a wave of desire and fear coursed through Nytlan's body. He knew exactly what Arvidi was suggesting, and a part of him yearned for it more than anything. But he also understood the danger of becoming involved with the King.
“Your Majesty,” Nytlan whispered. “I'm not sure if it's wise...”
Arvidi leaned in even closer, his breath hot against Nytlan's face. “Wise?” he said, his voice husky. “What is wisdom in the face of love, my dear Nytlan? We are not meant to deny our passions.”
Nytlan felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew King Arvidi was manipulating him, but he couldn't resist. As Arvidi pressed his lips to his again, Nytlan feeling a surge of desire as their tongues entwined.
For a moment, Nytlan was lost in the sensation, the heat of the king's body pressed against his own. But then, he pulled away, his breathing heavy. “Your Majesty, I—”
Arvidi held up a hand, silencing him. “No need to speak, Nytlan. I think I understand quite clearly what it is that you desire.” He took another sip of his wine, his eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint. “And I must say, I find myself rather intrigued by the idea.”
Nytlan's heart pounded inside his chest, a feeling he had never experienced before. He was usually composed and restrained, but being with Arvidi had awakened an intense passion within him that he never knew existed.
“My dear Nytlan, I've been waiting for this moment for so long,” Arvidi whispered softly before pressing his lips against Nytlan's for the third time.
Nytlan felt his heart swell as they kissed. He tasted the rich aroma of red wine on his tongue, a blend of black cherry and vanilla, along with the scent of blooming peonies during Ancestors' Days. He felt as if he were going to drown in his breath. Arvidi's touch ignited a flame within his soul, and he knew that his life would never be the same again.
As they parted, Arvidi gazed deeply into his eyes and smiled. “You are so beautiful,” he said, running his fingers through Nytlan's snowy hair. “I can't believe I finally have you.”
Nytlan had never felt so alive. In that moment, he didn't care about the consequences. All he knew was that he had admired Arvidi for so long, and he love the king with all his heart. He was willing to do whatever it took to make him happy.
“I’s my honor because you are the greatest king that Enngstan has ever known. ” He stuttered, “You are wise and just, and you have brought prosperity and peace to our people. I could not ask for a better ruler, or a better lover. I am all yours, Your Majesty,” he said, his voice barly above a whisper. “I am ready to serve you in any way that I can.”
Arvidi's eyes softened, and he pulled Nytlan into his embrace. “You are too kind, my love,” he said. “But I am glad you feel that way. I promise to cherish you and keep you safe for as long as we live.”
Nytlan closed his eyes and relished in Arvidi's embrace. He knew their love was forbidden, but at that moment, nothing else in the world mattered. He was with the man he loved, and that was all that counted.



 
Days passed. Between his duties, Nytlan found himself caught in a web of desire and passion. After long hours of planning and strategizing, Nytlan would find solace in Arvidi's arms. The king had a way of making him forget all about politics and focus solely on pleasure. They explored each other's bodies with reckless abandon, their love growing stronger with each passing day.
Their conversations began to shift from politics and war to more personal matters. Arvidi still tease Nytlan about his crush on Izel, and Nytlan would playfully deny it. But deep down, he knew there was some truth to it.
Every time Nytlan caught a glimpse of Izel in the palace, his heart skipped a beat. Her beauty was striking, with her cloudy chestnut hair and piercing emerald eyes. He longed to know more about the woman behind the princess. But he knew he couldn't pursue her, not when he was so intimately involved with Arvidi.
One evening, as Nytlan sat in his chambers pouring over maps and reports, there was a knock at his door. It was Izel, dressed in a simple yet elegant gown. Her beauty took Nytlan's breath away, and he found himself stumbling over his words.
“Grand Chancellor Hargrave,” she said, a smile playing at the corners of her lips. “I hope I am not interrupting your work.”
“No, not at all,” Nytlan replied, trying to compose himself. “What brings you here, Princess Izel?”
“I just wanted to check on you,” she said softly. “I know how hard you have been working.”
Nytlan felt his heart racing in his chest, unsure of what to say. Izel stood there, looking at him with a gentle expression. He found himself wanting to reach out and touch her, to feel her warmth.
“Thank you,” he finally managed to say. “That's very kind of you, Princess.”
The two of them talked for a while longer, discussing the upcoming war and the strategy Nytlan had been working on. Izel listened intently, nodding and offering her own insights.
As their discussion came to an end, he felt a pang of loss, thinking about her leaving.
“My father always speaks highly of your dedication and hard work,” she said casually.
Nytlan felt his heart warm at the compliment. “Thank you, Your Highness. I do my best to serve the kingdom.”
Izel looked at him thoughtfully for a moment before speaking again. “May I ask you something, Grand Chancellor?”
“Of course, Your Highness,” Nytlan replied, curious.
“I have noticed a change in my father since you came into his life,” Izel said sincerely. “He seems happier, more content. I cannot help but wonder what magic you have worked on him.”
Nytlan felt his heart swell at her words. He knew that what he and Arvidi shared was forbidden, but he could not deny that finding some consolation in this tryst was good for both of them.
“I have done nothing, Your Highness,” Nytlan managed to keep his voice steady, “I simply serve him to the best of my abilities.”
Izel nodded, her eyes still fixed on him. “I see,” she said slowly, with a little smile on the corner of her lips. “Well, I hope you will continue to serve him well. And I'll have to ask you for another thing.”
“Of course, Your Highness.”
“Please, call me Izel,” Izel smiled, her eyes sparkling. “We are friends, are we not?”
“Yes, of course,” he said, trying not to stammer.
After Izel left, Nytlan stood there for a moment, lost in thought. He found himself wanting to ask her more, to spend more time with her. But he knew the danger of getting too close to the princess, especially with his intimate involvement with the king. It would be too risky to caught between two powerful and influential figures in Enngstan.
As Nytlan made his way back to his own chamber, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He turned around to see a group of palace servants whispering and giggling amongst themselves. He knew that he was now a subject of their gossip too, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
But in the harem, rumors flew around no matter if he wanted to hear them or not. There were those old rumors again, even louder in volume here, whispering about the secret love affair between the father and daughter, their debauchery, and lustful activities.
“Have you heard what they do together?” one of them whispered.
“No, tell me,” the other replied.
That's when he heard it. The vivid sense that the king and the princess engaged in all sorts of debauchery together. It was like he was living through those wild parties and mad orgies personally. Nytlan was left both shocked and aroused. He couldn't believe what he was hearing but found himself unable to walk away.
That night, as he worked late into the evening, he found himself more distracted than ever before. His mind kept drifting back to the rumors. He couldn't believe that a father and daughter could have such a twisted bond, but the more he thought about it, the more intrigued he became.
The next day, Nytlan found himself more restless than ever before. He couldn't focus on his work, and he kept stealing glances at Izel whenever he had the chance. He knew that he needed to put his feelings aside and focus on his duties as chancellor, but he couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he was missing out on something important.
It wasn't long before he found himself wandering towards Arvidi's harem. He knew that his mind was a mess, but he couldn't resist the pull any longer.
As he stepped into the room, he felt a wave of heat wash over him. The king's chamber was filled with perfumed air, soft laughter, and music, and he found Arvidi surrounded by several of his most beautiful lovers. Nytlan's heart pounded as he approached the king, wondering what kind of reception he would receive. Arvidi was waiting for him, lounging on a divan with a glass of wine in his hand. Nytlan felt his heart skip a beat as Arvidi beckoned him closer.
Arvidi looked up as Nytlan approached, his eyes glinting with amusement. “What brings you here, my dear Nytlan?” he said, patting the space beside him on the divan.
Nytlan sat down, acutely aware of the eyes of the other men and women upon him. “I overheard some palace servants gossiping about you and the princess,” he said, trying to keep his tone casual. “They were saying things about your relationship that I couldn't quite believe.”
Arvidi laughed. “Oh, those silly servants,” he said, waving a hand dismissively. “They always love to gossip. But tell me, my dear Nytlan, what did they say?”
Nytlan hesitated for a moment, feeling a flush creep up his neck. “They said... they said that you and the princess have an unorthodox relationship,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.
Arvidi leaned in closer to Nytlan, his expression suddenly intense. “And what do you think of that?” he said, his voice low and seductive.
Nytlan felt a shiver run down his spine as Arvidi reached out and pulled him closer. He could feel the heat radiating off the king's body, and he knew that he was in trouble.
“I don't know what to think,” he said, his heart pounding in his chest as he met Arvidi's gaze. “It's not something I'm used to hearing about in the royal family.”
Arvidi's hand came to rest on Nytlan's thigh, and Nytlan couldn't suppress another shiver. “My dear Nytlan,” Arvidi said softly, “I promise you, the truth of my relationship with the princess is much more beautiful than any gossip could convey.”
Nytlan's mind reeled as Arvidi's hand inched higher up his inner thigh. The way Arvidi touched him made him feel like he was burning up from the inside out.
That night, Arvidi had expertly driven Nytlan to the heights of pleasure, distracting him from his doubts and uncertainties. As he lay in Arvidi's bed, exhausted, a deep sense of contentment washed over him. He realized that he was being drawn deeper and deeper into Arvidi's web of seduction. Nytlan knew what Arvidi was doing to him, but he couldn't resist the pull of Arvidi's beauty and charisma, nor the lure of the harem and the whispers of forbidden pleasure.
""You seem restless lately, my love,"" Arvidi said softly. ""Are the rumors bothering you that much?""
The king lightly caressed Nytlan's skin, slowly reigniting the fire in his abdomen.
""Well... not entirely,"" Nytlan attempted to reply but found it hard to concentrate with the king's expert touch.
""Oh?"" the king teased. ""Are you thinking about someone else?""
Nytlan gasped as the king grasped him once again. ""The princess,"" he finally chose to be honest. ""I... I have been thinking about your daughter.""
Arvidi raised an eyebrow. ""Izel?"" he asked with a hint of amusement in his tone. ""What about her?""
Nytlan felt his skin burning; the King's hand didn't stop moving. ""I know it's wrong, but I cannot help the feelings I have for her.""
Arvidi smiled knowingly. ""Ah, I see,"" he said. ""You are not the first man to be drawn to Izel's beauty and charm.""
Nytlan felt a pang of agony at Arvidi's words, but he tried to push it aside. ""But I shouldn't,"" he tried, desperation creeping into his voice. ""It's never been this hard for me.""
The king leaned in closer to him, his breath warm on Nytlan's neck. ""There is only one thing you can do,"" he whispered. ""Follow your heart.""
Nytlan looked at Arvidi, his eyes wide with surprise. ""But what about us?"" he asked. ""What about what we share?""
Arvidi smiled slyly. ""What we have is special, my love,"" he said. ""It is something that cannot be broken by mere desire.""



 
 
Nytlan found himself enjoying working with Izel more and more each day. He admired her swordsmanship and her ability to command the troops. Nytlan looked forward to their daily meetings, and he was happy to spend time with her.
They oversaw the training of the troops, ensuring they were ready for any possible conflict with Chashan. Nytlan watched as Izel moved gracefully among the soldiers, her sword at her side. He couldn't help but be impressed by her skill.
As they worked together, Nytlan and Izel talked about everything, from politics to their personal lives. In ways that he never had with Arvidi, Nytlan found himself opening up to Izel. He told her about his past, his family, and his dreams for the future. Izel listened intently, her eyes shining with interest. She was a good listener, and Nytlan felt a deep connection with her. He wondered if she felt the same way.
As they finished up for the day, Izel turned to him with a smile. “Thank you for your help today,” she said. “I couldn't have done it without you.”
Nytlan's heart raced at her words. He wanted to tell her how he felt, but he knew that it was too risky. He couldn't risk losing her friendship, or worse, being caught in the middle of a dangerous love triangle. Instead, he simply smiled back at her. “It was my pleasure.”
“You know, Nytlan, you are one of the most talented men I have ever met,” she continued. “You have an intelligence and a dedication to Enngstan that is unmatched. It's no wonder why Arvidi is so taken with you.”
Nytlan had looked at her and found himself blushing. Izel noticed his embarrassment and giggled. “Don't worry, Nytlan. I won't tell anyone about us.”
“Us?” Nytlan felt his heart skip a beat. “What do you mean, Izel?”
Izel smiled at him. “Oh, come now, Nytlan. You can't deny that we have a certain chemistry between us. Don't tell me you haven't thought about it?”
His heart was racing. He didn't know if the princess was just teasing him or if she really meant what she said, but he couldn't deny that he had thought about Izel in that way before. However, he also knew that it was wrong, especially given the relationship he had with Arvidi.
Nytlan looked away from her. “Izel, I... I can't. I mean, I can't think of you like that. You are the daughter of my king. It's not proper.”
Izel looked at him, her eyes glinting with amusement. “Oh, Nytlan. Don't be such a stick in the mud. Life is too short to deny ourselves the pleasures of the flesh. Besides, haven't you been with my father? What's a little flirtation between us in comparison?”
As his face heated up at her words, his mind untimely recalled the rumors about Izel and Arvidi. Although Nytlan had never believed them, now with Izel standing before him, looking so beautiful and alluring, he found himself wondering what it would be like to be with her.
He felt a sense of shame washing over him. He knew he shouldn't be thinking these things, but at the same time, he couldn't help it. He was drawn to Izel in a way that he couldn't explain.
As Nytlan drowned in his thought, Izel reached out and took his hand. “Come on, Nytlan. Let's go practice our sword fighting. Maybe that will take your mind off things.”
Nytlan agreed, feeling grateful for the distraction. As they made their way to the training grounds, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement building within him.
“Go easy on me,” Izel said, her green eyes glinting mischievously, “for this is our first time.”
Nytlan's face heated at her innuendo, but he tried to maintain his composure: “I heard you are a formidable force on the battlefield, Princess. I'll have to give you my all.”
Izel laughed, her voice unbridled and wholehearted, making Nytlan's heart sing. They took their places across from each other, each holding a sword. Nytlan felt his heart racing as they began to move, their swords clashing together with a resounding sound.
Although he had heard of her reputation, he was still amazed by her skills the first time he faced her in battle. She moved with grace and precision, her sword flashing through the air with deadly accuracy. He was a strong and skillful fighter too, but he found himself struggling to keep up with her, his mind racing as he tried to anticipate her next move.
As they continued, he couldn't help but notice her beauty during the fight. Her hair was tied back in a tight braid, and her face was a picture of concentration. Her movements were graceful and fluid, almost otherworldly. Their swords clanging against each other in a rhythm that was both graceful and fierce, his blood ran hotter with each parried and thrust.
Nytlan found himself growing more and more aroused. He couldn't deny the attraction he felt for Izel, and the rumors about her and Arvidi only fueled his fantasies. What would she be like in an intimate moment? Would she pant and flush like she is now? Her body rising and falling with fluidity and...
“You're distracted!” Izel yelled, sidestepping and knocking his sword aside, her own blade pointing straight at his throat. He looked at her and nearly lost his breath. She seemed to be glowing all over in front of him, and the image of the two of them together, their bodies entwined in passion, was still vivid in his mind's eye.
Nytlan threw down his sword and raised his hands to surrender.
 
“Did my father wear you out last night?” Izel teased as they took off their protective gear. “Or are you already planning your night service to the king while the sun is still in the sky?”
“I won't be serving the king tonight,” he denied, then immediately blushed.
She laughed heartily. “What are you thinking about then?” Her eyes sparkled with mischief. “Are you thinking of me?”
His mind burned under her intense gaze, he needed to come up with something to deflect this topic.
“Rumors,” he stammered before he realized what he was saying. “The rumors about you and the king. Are they true?”
In the moment of his horror, Izel's expression remained inscrutable. But in a twinkling, her lovely face lit up with a sly smile. “Are you sure you want to know, Grand Chancellor?”
Nytlan's heart skipped a beat at the use of his formal title. “I-I...um, well, I just...I was...” He stammered, “my apologies, Princess, forget what I've said.”
Izel chuckled, crossing her arms over her chest. Obviously she couldn’t let him off the hook that easy. “Despite being bothered by an old rumor, I'd rather focus on real-life enjoyment, wouldn't you agree?” she said, winking at him.
“I don't know what you mean,” he said, trying to avoid the question.
Izel tilted her head to the side, a smirk playing on her lips. “Oh, I think you do,” she said, her eyes dancing with amusement. “But since you're so curious about rumors, let me tell you some of the debauchery I've heard about you and the King.”
Nytlan's eyes widened in shock. “What?”
Izel leaned in closer to him and spoke in a low and sultry voice. “Oh, you know,” she said, “the rumors about you in the King's harem, and how you're quite the skilled lover. That you and Arvidi make out in every corner of the palace, and that the King can't get enough of you, even sharing you with his other concubines.”
“That's ridiculous,” he muttered, feeling his cheeks flush bright red.
But Izel wouldn't stop; her words poured out like a river. She continued to talk about those dissolute rumors, and her words made Nytlan feel both incredibly embarrassed and aroused. He couldn't think straight among those images of him and Arvidi, their naked bodies entangled with Arvidi's other beautiful concubines. He stared at Izel but couldn't find a way to stop her talking. He just wanted to erase the teasing smile from the corner of her lips.
Before he knew it, he had grabbed Izel and kissed her passionately.
Izel gasped in surprise, but then melted into the kiss. She wrapped her arms around Nytlan's neck and returned the kiss with equal fervor. Their tongues entangled, and their bodies pressed together. They deepened the kiss before finally pulling away, breathless and dizzy with desire.
“I may not be the king,” Izel whispered, still panting, her face flushed by the kiss, “but I could still show you a good time.”
Nytlan felt his heart swell at her words. He was both thrilled and terrified by the idea of being with her in such an intimate way.
“Izel,” he said, his voice husky. “I don't know if-”
Izel placed a finger on his lips, silencing him. “Shh,” she said, her eyes sparkling when she looked into his eyes, “Don't think about it too much. Seize the moment. Just let yourself feel.”
For the first time, Nytlan let go of his struggle. He nodded, his heart racing as Izel led him to her private chambers.
 
Nytlan felt as if he was on fire as he pressed Izel against the wall, their mouths locked in a heated kiss. He could feel her hands sliding up and down his back, her body pressing against his with desperate hunger. He had wanted her for so long, and now that he finally had her, he couldn't get enough.
As he moved his lips to her neck, nipping and sucking at the delicate skin, he felt Izel's legs wrap around his waist. He growled deep in his throat, his hands moving to grip her hips tightly as he ground his body against hers.
They broke apart for a moment, panting heavily, and Nytlan couldn't help but marvel at the sight of Izel's flushed face, her hair a wild mess around her shoulders. She was so beautiful, so fierce and strong. He wanted to be with her always, to feel her body close to his, to taste her sweet kisses.
Without another word, they moved to the bed. Nytlan shed his clothes quickly as Izel watched with dark eyes. He could feel her gaze on him, her hands running over his chest and down his stomach, and he shivered with pleasure.
As they came together once more, their movements grew more frantic and urgent. Her disheveled beauty was so gorgeous and sinful that Nytlan couldn't help but think about the rumors again. He imagined what it would be like if it were Arvidi instead of him, with the king's hands on Izel's body, his lips pressing against hers, and their bodies entangled in frenzied lovemaking. He could hear their moans and the sound of their skin slapping together. The thought was both thrilling and terrifying, and it only fueled his passion even more, making him desperate to have her for himself.
Izel's body was so responsive to him, so eager and hungry. He felt like he was drowning in her, in the heat and passion of their lovemaking. He could feel her nails digging into his back, her hips bucking against his. He was consumed by the warmth of her body writhing beneath him, the sound of her moans filling his ears and driving him further into his own desire. It was like nothing he had ever experienced before. He kissed her deeply, his tongue exploring her mouth as he pressed his body against hers. He felt her moan into his mouth, her body arching up into his. A wild rush of pleasure hit him like a tide, leaving him breathless and dizzy.
As they lay tangled together, their bodies slick with sweat, Nytlan couldn't help but think about the rumors once more. He pushed the thought away, unwilling to let it spoil the moment. For now, he was content to simply be with Izel, to feel her body close to his, to know that he was the one she desired above all others.",0

"Wendy sat on her bed, reading through the replies Stan had sent. She wished she could go back to that blissful ignorance, back to when she thought Stan was really writing all of these, back to when everything was perfect between them.She was so happy, talking to anyone and everyone who would listen about how Stan had finally started listening to her. She was delighted, saying that she only needed to tell him and he started to care! Maybe he loved her all along, he just didn’t show it as much!In retrospect, she should’ve known. None of these sounded like Stan. And he never read them, either.  He never even took the time to skim over the texts. He didn’t care what she had to say, at any point? She thought back to the time in the café, Stan’s nervous laughter, inconsistent stories and sudden departure. She could kick herself; it had been so obvious.Maybe she had known. Maybe she just pretended, because she wanted it to be real. At least Stan had tried. He tried to find a solution and make her feel loved. He gave her a couple of days of delusional happiness, at least.
Stan started miserably at his phone. He scrolled up, finally reading the texts that he had sent. He read all of the poetic messages, expressing his love and adoration for Wendy. He read the delight in her replies, a happiness coming through the words that he'd never seen before. He felt so, so guilty, that he could never write like this. He didn't even know what half of the words meant.It was like the ai was taking his girlfriend from him, talking in a language he couldn’t understand.His heart sank as he read further. He read about Wendy baring her soul, telling her deepest secrets. He read the ai comforting her, understanding her. He hadn't even known. He didn't even know, and he went up to her the next day at school and spoke to her, not knowing anything at all.Texts and texts, going on for so long. He hadn’t even realised how much they had been talking, because the copy and pasting had become such a second nature that he didn’t even remember doing it.
He typed out the words 'I'm sorry'. They weren't enough. They’d never be enough. But he didn't know what else to say, and could only pray Wendy would understand. He didn’t deserve to be understood.
Wendy stared at the words on her screen. What was she supposed to say? That she couldn’t believe that he had to use ai to talk to her? That he wouldn’t make an effort at all, even now? That he’d go back to just a giving thumbs up, eventually leading to the situation they were in before? She started to type, but paused. She sighed and turned her phone off, laying it on her nightstand, turning the light off and pulling the covers over her head.Stan watched the little dots at the bottom of his screen, awaiting Wendy’s response. He didn’t know what she was going to say, he didn’t know what he was going to say.The little dots disappeared.Stan frowned at his phone. He waited for a moment, because maybe Wendy was stuck with a word, maybe she had just paused for a second. He sat there for two minutes, the dots never reappearing, before his heart started to slowly sink.He waited patiently over the next hour or so, before realising that Wendy wasn’t going to respond to him. He felt a little sick. She always responded. Stan called Kyle and took a minute for the ring to go through. He was scared because he thought that maybe Kyle was mad at him too, but after only a moment the line went through.‘Hello?’ a tired voice said .
‘Kyle. I need your help’ Stan said, bouncing his leg up and down anxiously.
‘Dude it's like, 1:00 in the morning,’ Kyle said. He did sound like he had just woken up, but Stan just ignored it because he had bigger problems right now‘Say if someone was using an ai to talk to their girlfriend.  Because they were busy all the time and it helped them and it made everything so much easier! What if that happened and what if their girlfriend caught them?’ Stan asked.  Kyle paused on the other end, then said ‘Holy shit, whoever did that is such a douchebag. Was it Clyde? I’ll bet it was Clyde,’ ‘That doesn’t matter,’ Stan mumbled, dejected. Kyle didn’t seem to notice, and went on
‘That’s be an awful thing to do to your girlfriend, I mean, why have a partner if you don't even know what to talk to them? Imagine having to use an AI to talk to someone! At that point they’re better off without you,’ ‘Oh my god,’ Stan burst out with despair. ‘What’s wrong?’ Kyle asked him, confused.‘I was talking about me! I did that to Wendy,’ Stan exclaimed. ‘You're joking, right?’ Kyle asked, a disappointed disbelief evident in his tone as Stan mumbled a small ‘no.’
‘That’s horrible, Stan,’ Kyle told him reproachfully, sitting up in his bed. ‘Wait, is that what you were doing that whole time on your phone?’ Kyle asked. ‘Yeah,’ Stan sighed. He hadn’t been allowed to tell anyone about the ai per his and Cartman’s agreement, so Kyle hadn’t known what he was doing.‘What do I do?!’ Stan asked desperately.  ‘You need to go and apologise and make it up to her. Shit, is she okay?’ Stan hesitated before saying ‘She hasn't replied to me.’
‘Did you even think about what you were doing to her? At all?’ Kyle asked.
‘Well, she was happy, and I didn’t have to do anything…’ Stan trailed off.
Kyle muttered a small ‘Oh my god,’ before earnestly telling him ‘Dude, you need apologise,’ ‘I did,’ ‘Did you tell her in person?’ ‘…No.’‘It’s that bad though, right?’ Stan asked in a last ditch effort to make himself feel better ‘It's that bad,’ the other said quietly, and the line went dead.  Stan stared at the screen as it slowly dimmed, guilt and shame settling in as he realised that he really fucked up this time.Stan was determined to make it up to Wendy, though he didn’t know how. He was rehearsing a speech in his head on his way to school, when he saw some flowers on the side of the road. He decided to pick them and present them as a bouquet, because girls liked flowers, right? He waved at Wendy when he got up to the school. Bebe asked her something before shooting Stan a glare and going inside, leaving Wendy to wait for Stan to walk up to her. 'Wendy, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean-' He began, before Wendy cut him off. ‘Just drop it, Stan.' she said. 'What? he asked, hurt.'Just leave it. It’s fine.' she didn’t take the flowers and she just walked away, leaving Stan standing in the hallway with a bouquet of flowers for a girl who didn’t love him, not anymore. He could keep trying, but what was the point? she'd never take him back. it was over. He had fucked up royally, and there was nothing to do about it anymore.He was a little upset, too, because he was trying. Look at him, with his flowers and rehearsed speeches. He found it unfair that Wendy was just ignoring him, when he was trying to tell her about his feelings.He never once stopped to think about the irony.Kyle found Stan sitting on the steps, a sullen expression on his face. 'What’s going on?' he asked. 'I thought you were supposed to make it up to Wendy,'
'She won’t take me back,' Stan mumbled.'Of course she's going to say that, dumbass. Do you think she'll take you back after one gesture?' he glanced at the poor excuse of a bouquet on the steps beside stan. 'Jesus christ, is that what you gave to her? No wonder she didn’t take you back.’Stan buried his face in his hands at Kyle’s words. 'Look, I know you’re upset, but from what you’ve told me, she has it a lot worse. It’s going to take some work to fix this, whether you like it or not. A relationship is all about work and communication, especially after an argument or… whatever you did,’ Kyle sighed. Wendy stood in the hallway in front of her locker. She was looking at the poorly worded love letter sitting in her locker, along with the paper cut out hearts stuck on it. She didn’t know what to do. She took out the love letter and traced her finger over the ink splotches, and the words  with extra letters shoved in so they were spelt correctly.Bebe’s opinion was that Stan wasn’t worth it and that Wendy should’ve left him a while ago. Bebe had been furious after finding out about Clyde and would stop at nothing to get revenge and to make sure it didn’t happen to anyone else. She was disgusted when Wendy told her Stan’s sorry excuse.Kyle walked past Wendy’s locker. 'Kyle!' she called. He turned around and stood beside her. 'What is it?' he asked. 'Should I forgive stan?' she said. 'I know what he's done is bad, but... I mean, he’s trying, right?' she said, gesturing at the locker. Kyle looked at her sadly. ' I think he could try harder,' he said,  giving her a pat on the back and walking away.Wendy was left in the hallway, a love letter from a boy who didn’t care enough about her sitting inside it. She faced her locker and started to peel the paper hearts off the front of it, gathering them into a handful and throwing them into the bin. The love note, now sitting in her pocket, felt as heavy as a rock. She took it out and looked at it. Her heart and her brain fought against each other, one with reason and the other with love, saying to leave Stan or to stay with him.Wendy looked at her locker, with the gluestick stains and little paper scraps still stuck to it. She didn’t want to think about this anymore, she didn’t want to have to agonise over whether Stan deserved to be forgiven or not, whether he was trying hard enough.She put the note back into her locker and closed it.",0

"As the shaking and rumbling intensifies, Mysterion and Professor Chaos start to panic.Mysterion: ""What's happening? Is the cave collapsing?""Professor Chaos: ""I don't know, but we need to find a way out before it's too late.""[They frantically look around, but the cave seems to be closing in on them.]Mysterion: ""We're trapped. There's no way out.""Professor Chaos: ""No, no, no. We can't give up yet. There has to be a way.""[Just then, they hear a loud cracking sound, and a section of the cave ceiling collapses, revealing a bright light shining through.]Mysterion: ""Look, there's light! We have to go towards it!""Professor Chaos: ""It could be our only chance. Let's go!""[As they run towards the light, the sound of the explosion outside the cave becomes louder and louder. Suddenly, they are thrown backwards by the force of the blast, hitting their heads and losing consciousness.][When they wake up, they find themselves lying next to each other, bruised and confused. As they struggle to stand up, they notice each other's costumes.]Mysterion: ""Wait, Chaos...your mask is off. You're Butters?""[Kenny can't believe what he just heard. He's angry, hurt, and disappointed that his crush, Butters, is actually Professor Chaos. He turns to Butters with a look of disbelief and frustration.]Kenny: ""Butters...I can't believe it. You've been causing chaos and destruction all over town? How could you?""Butters: ""Kenny, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for it to go this far. I just...I just wanted to feel like I had some control over my life.""Kenny: ""Control? You call this control? You're hurting innocent people, Butters. You're causing chaos and destruction. How could you do this?""Butters: ""I know, Kenny. And I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to go this far. I was just...lost. And I didn't know how to find my way back.""Kenny: ""I can't believe it. I can't believe I could be in love with a villain like you, Butters. How could you do this to me?""Butters: ""Kenny, please. I know I messed up. I know I made a mistake. But I swear, I'll make it right. I'll turn myself in. I'll do whatever it takes to make things right between us.""Kenny: ""Make things right? You think you can just make things right after all this? You've betrayed my trust, Butters. How can I ever trust you again?""Butters: ""I don't know, Kenny. But please, don't give up on me. I need you now more than ever. I need you to help me find my way back.""[Kenny looks at Butters with a mix of anger and sadness. He's not sure what to do or how to feel. Butters looks back at him with tears in his eyes, pleading for forgiveness.]Butters: ""Kenny, please. I'm begging you. Forgive me. Give me a chance to make things right.""[Kenny takes a deep breath and looks away, trying to process his emotions.]Kenny: ""I don't know, Butters. I just...I need some time to think.""Butters: ""I understand, Kenny. Take all the time you need. I'll be here when you're ready.""[Butters takes a step closer to Kenny, but he takes a step back. He needs some space to think, to process everything that's happened. Butters looks at him with sadness and regret, knowing that he's hurt the person he cares about most.]Butters looks at Kenny with a troubled expression, knowing deep down that he should be a better person than Professor Chaos, but feeling trapped in his villain persona.Butters: ""Kenny, I know I shouldn't be doing this. I know I should be a good person, but I just can't seem to shake off the thrill of being Professor Chaos. It's like I'm addicted to causing chaos and destruction.""Kenny's face softens, seeing the pain in Butters' eyes.Kenny: ""Butters, you can't keep doing this. You're hurting people, and you're hurting yourself. You need to find a way to stop.""Butters nods, tears welling up in his eyes.Butters: ""I know, Kenny. I want to stop, I really do. But every time I try to walk away, I feel this pull, this need to cause chaos. It's like I can't control it.""Kenny puts a comforting arm around Butters, understanding the struggle he's going through.Kenny: ""I'll help you, Butters. We'll find a way to break this addiction together. You don't have to do this alone.""Butters smiles weakly, grateful for Kenny's support.Butters: ""Thank you, Kenny. I don't deserve your kindness, but I'm grateful for it.""Kenny shakes his head, firmly believing that Butters is a good person at heart.Kenny: ""You do deserve it, Butters. You're not just Professor Chaos. You're a good person, and I know you can overcome this.""Butters takes a deep breath, feeling a glimmer of hope for the first time in a long time.Butters: ""I'll try, Kenny. I'll really try.""Butters struggles to keep his promise to Kenny and eventually breaks it, falling back into his old ways as Professor Chaos. He becomes increasingly self-destructive, lashing out at those around him and causing chaos in the town.Kenny tries to talk to Butters and convince him to stop, but Butters refuses to listen. He is consumed by his villainous alter ego and refuses to give it up.Kenny: ""Butters, you promised me you would stop this. What happened?""Butters glares at Kenny, his eyes filled with anger and frustration.Butters: ""I don't know, Kenny! Maybe I just can't stop! Maybe this is who I am!""Kenny shakes his head, feeling saddened by Butters' words.Kenny: ""No, Butters. You're not Professor Chaos. You're a good person, and you can choose to be better.""Butters scoffs, feeling resentful towards Kenny.Butters: ""You don't understand, Kenny. You don't know what it's like to be me. You don't know what it's like to feel this way.""Kenny looks at Butters, his eyes filled with empathy.Kenny: ""I may not know exactly how you feel, Butters, but I know that you're better than this. I know that you can be a good person if you choose to be.""Butters looks away, feeling angry and ashamed.Butters: ""I don't know if I can, Kenny. I don't know if I even want to try anymore.""Kenny sighs, feeling disappointed but not giving up on his friend.Kenny: ""I'll always be here for you, Butters. Whenever you're ready to choose a better path, I'll be here to help you.""Butters nods, feeling conflicted and unsure of what to do next. He knows that he's let Kenny down and that he's hurt the people around him, but he's not sure if he's capable of changing.As Kenny's words sink in, Butters can feel his resolve slipping. He knows he's hurt the people he cares about, and he can see the disappointment in Kenny's eyes. One last time, he turns back to his friend with a sorrowful and pained expression.For a moment, he's tempted to listen to Kenny, to give up the Professor Chaos persona and try to be a better person. But the allure of chaos and power is too strong, and Butters feels like he's already gone too far to turn back now.With a heavy heart, he shakes his head and turns away from Kenny, back to his life of villainy. But as he walks away, his eyes glisten with unshed tears, and he knows that a part of him will always regret the choices he's made.Kenny watches as Butters walks away, his heart heavy with disappointment and a sense of loss. He can't bear to see his friend continue down this path of villainy, and he runs after him, calling out for him to stop.""Butters, please! You don't have to be this way. You're better than this. You can be a hero, not just a villain.""Butters stops in his tracks and turns to face Kenny, a conflicted expression on his face. He knows that Kenny is right, that he should try to be a better person, but the pull of the chaos and power is too strong.""Kenny, I wish I could change. I really do. But this is who I am, who I have to be. I can't just turn my back on everything I've done and everything I've become. I'm sorry.""Kenny's heart sinks as he realizes that Butters is determined to continue down this dark path. He knows he can't force his friend to change, but he can't help feeling like he's lost something precious.As Butters walks away, Kenny watches him go, his heart heavy with a sense of sadness and loss. He can only hope that someday, Butters will find a way to break free from the cycle of villainy and embrace his true potential as a hero.Years have passed and Mysterion has become a seasoned hero, still fighting for justice and protecting his city. One night, he comes face to face with Professor Chaos, who has grown even more powerful and dangerous than before.They stand across from each other, both battle-scarred and weary. Mysterion can see the pain and darkness in Butters' eyes, and he knows that his old friend is lost to him.""You're too far gone, Butters,"" Mysterion says, his voice heavy with regret. ""I don't know how to save you anymore.""Butters looks at him, his expression bleak and resigned. ""I know,"" he says quietly. ""I'm sorry, Kenny. I'm sorry for everything.""They stand there in silence for a long moment, the weight of their history and all they've been through hanging heavily between them. Mysterion feels tears prick at the corners of his eyes, and he fights to keep his voice steady.""Why did it have to be this way?"" he asks, his voice breaking. ""We were supposed to be heroes, Butters. We were supposed to fight for what's right.""Butters just shakes his head, his eyes haunted. ""I know, Kenny. I know. But I can't change who I am. I can't just stop being Professor Chaos. It's all I have left.""Mysterion feels a sense of crushing defeat wash over him. He knows that there's nothing more he can do, that Butters is lost to him forever.""I'll always remember you, Butters,"" he says softly. ""The good and the bad. The hero and the villain.""[Kenny is battling the Coon when he suddenly hears a voice behind him.]Butters: ""Kenny?""[Kenny turns around and sees Butters standing there, looking determined.]Kenny: ""Butters? What are you doing here?""Butters: ""I have to do what's right, Kenny. And what's right is stopping the Coon.""Kenny: ""Butters, you've been on the other side for so long. How can you just switch over like that?""Butters: ""It's not about switching sides, Kenny. It's about doing what's right. And what's right is stopping this villain from hurting anyone else.""Kenny: ""I guess...I guess I see your point. Butters, you know this isn't going to be easy, right? The Coon is dangerous. He won't go down without a fight.""Butters: ""I know, Kenny. But...I have to do this. For myself, and for everyone else he's hurt. Are you with me?""Kenny: ""Of course, Butters. I'm always with you.""[They share a determined look before turning back towards the fight, ready to take down the Coon and save the day.]Butters had learned of the Coon's plan to kill Mysterion, and he knew he had to act fast to save his former love. He arrived just in time to intercept the Coon's attack on Kenny, but in the ensuing fight, Butters realized he was outmatched.Kenny watched in horror as the Coon's attacks landed on Butters, leaving him bruised and battered. He tried to intervene, but Butters pushed him back, shouting, ""This is my fight, Kenny! I have to do this!""Kenny pleaded with Butters to stop, but Butters was determined. ""Don't you see, Kenny?"" he said. ""This is what you always wanted for me. To be a hero, to do good. I can't just stand by and let the Coon kill you. I have to stop him, no matter the cost.""He steps out in front of him with tears in his eyes “I have to do this, I have to save you.”“Butters you don’t- this isn’t what I meant-” he scrambles to get out frantic, losing breathe. He can’t die this way not for his sake.""Heh, how adorable, a lovers' spat. But we don't have all day, you see. I don't give a damn who it is, as long as both of you end up six feet under in the end.""As the Coon lunges forward, ready to strike the final blow, Butters steps in front of Kenny, shielding him from the attack. With a sickening thud, one of the Coon's sharp claws impales Butters' body, causing him to crumple to the ground in agony. The final moments were a blur as Butters stepped in front of Kenny to protect him from the Coon's attack. The sharp claws sliced through his body, and Butters fell to the ground. Kenny rushed to his side, tears streaming down his face.""I finally did it, Ken,"" Butters said weakly. ""I was a hero.""Kenny's sobs echoed through the desolate streets as he cradled Butters' lifeless body in his arms. He looked up at the Coon, his eyes filled with a burning rage.""You're going to pay for what you did,"" he growled, standing up to face his enemy. ""I'll make sure you never hurt anyone again.""The Coon smirked, ready for the fight. But Kenny had never been more determined, fueled by the memory of his lost love. Kenny's eyes narrowed as he faced off against the Coon, the villain who had caused so much destruction and chaos. He knew that he couldn't let him win this time, not when Butters had sacrificed himself for him.""You're not going to win this time,"" Kenny growled, his fists clenched at his sides.The Coon chuckled. ""Oh, Kenny, you've always been so predictable. Do you really think you can defeat me?""""I have to,"" Kenny replied, his voice filled with determination. ""For Butters.""The Coon sneered. ""Butters? He was nothing but a pawn in this game, just like you.""Kenny felt a surge of anger. Butters may have been a villain, but he had also been a friend. And now he was gone, because he had made the ultimate sacrifice for Kenny.""Enough talk,"" Kenny said, his voice low and dangerous. ""Let's finish this.""He charged at the Coon, throwing punch after punch. The Coon was fast, but Kenny was faster, and soon he had the villain on the ground.""You...you can't do this,"" the Coon gasped.""I already have,"" Kenny replied, his voice cold.He raised his fist, ready to deliver the final blow, but then he hesitated. Was this what Butters would have wanted? To see another life snuffed out, even the life of a villain?Kenny lowered his fist, taking a step back. ""I'm not like you,"" he said. ""I won't kill someone just because I can.""The Coon glared up at him, but Kenny didn't waver. He had won the fight, but he had also won something much more important: the realization that he could be a hero without resorting to violence.As he walked away from the defeated Coon, Kenny knew that he would always remember Butters, the friend who had shown him the true meaning of sacrifice and redemption.Kenny can't help but feel a sense of emptiness without Butters by his side. He knows that Butters would have been proud of him for carrying on the fight, but he can't shake the feeling that he's lost something precious.With the defeat of the Coon and the loss of their friend and ally, Butters, Kenny and the others mourned for weeks. They visited Butters' grave regularly, laying flowers and sharing memories of their fallen friend.Kenny, especially, felt a deep sadness in his heart. He couldn't help but wonder if things would have turned out differently if he had been faster or stronger, or if he had sacrificed himself instead of Butters. He felt a heavy weight on his shoulders, knowing that he had lost his chance to tell Butters how he truly felt about him.But as time passed, the pain began to fade. The boys returned to their normal lives, but they never forgot the lessons they learned during their battles with the Coon and Professor Chaos.Kenny knew that he had to cherish the people he cared about and never take them for granted. He also knew that Butters would want him to continue fighting for what was right, even if it meant putting his own life on the line.And so, Kenny donned his Mysterion costume once again, ready to continue his fight against injustice and evil in the town of South Park. As he looked up at the stars, he whispered a silent promise to Butters, that he would never forget him, and that he would continue to be the hero that Butters always knew he could be.",0

Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy had always been enemies, ever since they first met on the Hogwarts Express. Hermione was a Gryffindor and Draco was a Slytherin, and they couldn't have been more different. Hermione was kind, intelligent, and loyal, while Draco was arrogant, cruel, and selfish. They clashed at every turn, and it seemed like they would never get along.










But then, in their seventh year at Hogwarts, something strange started to happen. Hermione began to see Draco in a different light. She noticed that he wasn't always as confident as he pretended to be, and that he seemed to be struggling with something. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she felt a strange sense of compassion towards him.
Draco, too, began to see Hermione in a new way. He had always thought of her as a know-it-all, but now he saw that she was actually kind and caring. He couldn't help but be drawn to her, even though he knew that it was forbidden.
It started with small things - a glance across the classroom, a smile that lingered a little too long. They began to talk more, and Hermione found herself confiding in Draco in a way that she never had before. He listened to her, and she listened to him, and they found that they had more in common than they ever could have imagined.
It was a slow process, but eventually, they realized that they had fallen in love. They knew that it was risky - their friends would never understand, and their families would be furious. But they couldn't help the way they felt.
They started meeting in secret, stealing moments whenever they could. They would sneak out of their dormitories at night and meet in the Forbidden Forest, where they would talk and laugh and kiss under the stars. It was dangerous, but it was also thrilling.
They knew that they couldn't keep their relationship a secret forever. Eventually, they would have to face the consequences of their actions. But for now, they were content to be in love, and to enjoy each other's company.
In the end, they knew that their love would never be accepted by everyone. But they didn't care. They had each other, and that was all that mattered. They were Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy, two people who were supposed to be enemies, but who had found something special in each other. And they knew that, no matter what happened, their love would endure",0
"THAT DAY AT THE PARKby: chatgpt Freddy, Chica, Foxy, and Bonnie had always been close friends, ever since they were children. They had grown up together, going on adventures, sharing laughs, and always sticking by each other's side. But as they got older, they started to realize that there might be something more between them.It started with little things. Freddy found himself looking at Chica's smile a little too long, and Foxy couldn't help but admire Bonnie's mischievous grin. Chica noticed how strong Freddy's arms were, and Bonnie couldn't help but be drawn to Foxy's confidence and swagger. They all tried to ignore their feelings, telling themselves that it was just friendship, but it became harder and harder to deny.One day, when they were all hanging out at the park, Freddy decided to take the plunge. ""Guys, there's something I need to say,"" he said, looking nervous. The others turned to look at him, curious. ""I...I think I'm in love with Chica.""There was a moment of silence as everyone processed the confession. Chica's eyes widened in surprise, and Bonnie and Foxy exchanged a knowing look. ""Freddy, I...I don't know what to say,"" said Chica, sounding flustered.But before anyone could say anything else, Foxy spoke up. ""Look, guys, I know this is weird, but...I think I have feelings for Bonnie too,"" he said, looking down at his feet.There was another silence, this one even longer than the last. But eventually, Bonnie spoke up. ""Honestly, I've been feeling the same way about you, Foxy,"" he said, looking up and meeting Foxy's gaze.The four of them stood there, unsure of what to do next. But then Chica spoke up. ""Look, we've been friends for so long, and I don't want to lose that. But...maybe we could try dating? Just to see how it feels?""The others nodded, and they all shared a nervous laugh. From that moment on, they started exploring their feelings for each other, going on dates and sharing intimate moments. It wasn't always easy, but they all agreed that it was worth it to be with the ones they loved.And so, the four friends-turned-lovers continued to navigate their relationship, learning about each other and growing closer every day. They still had their moments of awkwardness and uncertainty, but they knew that they had each other's backs, no matter what. And as they walked away from the park that day, hand in hand, they knew that their love would carry them through any challenge that lay ahead.",0
"The sun was setting over the desolate landscape of the Middle East as the unmanned aerial vehicle hovered above a small village, its cameras capturing every detail. Inside the command center, the drone operator sat, his finger on the trigger of the Hellfire missiles. He was tasked with taking out a high-value target, a suspected terrorist who had been planning attacks against innocent civilians.As the drone operator prepared to fire, he received a message from his superiors. The target was confirmed to be in the building below, but there were also several innocent civilians inside, including women and children. The operator hesitated for a moment, knowing that his decision could mean life or death for these people.But before he could make a decision, he saw movement on his screen. A group of armed men had gathered outside the building, and they were starting to advance towards the entrance. The operator knew that he had to act quickly. He fired two Hellfire missiles, each hitting their target with deadly precision.The explosion was massive, sending debris and dust flying in all directions. The operator watched in horror as the building crumbled to the ground, the screams of the civilians trapped inside ringing in his ears. He felt sick to his stomach, wondering if he had just killed innocent people.As the dust settled, the operator quickly scanned the area. To his relief, he saw that the armed men had all been taken out, but there was no sign of the high-value target. He reported his findings to his superiors, who told him to continue monitoring the area in case the target tried to escape.As the hours passed, the operator watched as a group of people emerged from the rubble of the destroyed building. They were covered in dust and debris, but they seemed to be alive. The operator was relieved to see that they were all civilians, and he breathed a sigh of relief.But as he continued to watch, he saw something that made his blood run cold. One of the men was holding a small child in his arms, and she was covered in blood. The operator immediately radioed for medical assistance, and a team was dispatched to the area.When the medical team arrived, they found that the child had been injured by shrapnel from the drone strike. They quickly administered first aid and rushed her to a nearby hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery.The operator watched as the child was loaded into the ambulance, his heart heavy with guilt. He knew that he had been following orders, but he couldn't shake the feeling that he had done something terrible.Days turned into weeks, and the operator couldn't get the image of the injured child out of his mind. He began to question the morality of drone strikes and the impact they had on innocent civilians. He wondered if he had been part of something that was ultimately causing more harm than good.One night, as he sat alone in his apartment, the operator received a call from his superior. He was told that the child had survived the surgery but had lost an arm. The operator felt a wave of sadness wash over him, knowing that he had played a part in this tragedy.But then his superior said something that shocked him. The child's family had requested to speak with him, and they wanted to thank him for his role in the drone strike. They explained that the high-value target had been responsible for a string of attacks in their village, and they had been living in fear for months.The family told the operator that they knew the risks of living in a war zone and that they were grateful for any efforts to make their lives safer. They expressed their hope that the child's sacrifice would not be in vain and that one day, their village could be free from violence and fear.The operator listened to their words, his eyes filled with tears. He realized that the situation was not as black and white as he had originally thought. While the drone strike had caused harm to innocent civilians, it had also prevented future attacks and brought a sense of safety to the village.He understood that sometimes difficult decisions had to be made in war, and that there were no easy answers. But he also knew that he had to continue to question the ethics of his actions and strive to minimize harm to innocent civilians.As he hung up the phone, the operator felt a sense of resolve. He knew that he could never undo the harm that had been done, but he could work to prevent future tragedies. He made a vow to himself to always keep the human cost of war in mind and to do everything in his power to protect innocent lives.The drone strike had been fiery, but in the end, it had brought a sense of peace to the village. The operator would never forget the lessons he had learned and the sacrifices that had been made. And he would always strive to do better, to make the world a safer and more just place for all.In the following weeks, the operator sought out resources to help him understand the ethical and moral implications of his actions as a drone operator. He attended training sessions and engaged in conversations with fellow operators, military officials, and human rights advocates.Through these discussions, he gained a deeper understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of war, and the importance of minimizing harm to civilians.He also became an advocate for incorporating human rights considerations into military decision-making, and worked to push for greater transparency and accountability in drone strikes.As he continued his work, the operator received news that the child he had inadvertently injured had been fitted with a prosthetic arm and was doing well. The family had moved to a safer area and had been able to rebuild their lives with the help of aid organizations.The operator was relieved to hear that the child and her family were safe and thriving, but he knew that many others in the region were still living in fear and instability.He redoubled his efforts to advocate for greater accountability and transparency in military operations, and worked to raise awareness about the human cost of war.Over time, the operator became known as a champion for human rights and an advocate for the ethical use of drones in military operations. His work was instrumental in shaping policies and practices that helped to minimize harm to civilians and hold those responsible for wrongdoing accountable.Years later, as the operator looked back on that fateful drone strike, he felt a mix of emotions. He knew that the decision he had made that day had caused harm to innocent people, but he also knew that he had used that experience to learn and grow.He had become a better and more conscientious operator, and had worked to make a difference in the lives of those affected by war. And while he knew that there were no easy answers or simple solutions, he remained committed to the cause of justice and the protection of human rights for all.As the operator continued to work on behalf of human rights, he received an unexpected call from an unfamiliar number. Answering it, he was shocked to hear the voice of the very child he had injured in the drone strike years earlier.The child, now a young woman, had managed to track down the operator through her own investigations into the drone strike. She was calling to seek answers, and to ask the operator to take responsibility for the harm he had caused.The operator was taken aback by the call, but he knew that he had to face the consequences of his actions. He agreed to meet with the young woman, and they arranged to meet in a nearby city.When they met, the young woman was understandably emotional. She shared with the operator the trauma and pain that she and her family had experienced as a result of the drone strike. She described the challenges of growing up without an arm, and the ongoing fear and uncertainty that haunted her community.The operator listened carefully, his heart heavy with guilt and remorse. He knew that he could never undo the harm that had been done, but he promised to do everything in his power to make things right.Together, the operator and the young woman began working to seek justice for the victims of the drone strike. They lobbied government officials, spoke to the media, and reached out to human rights organizations for support.Over time, their efforts began to pay off. They were able to secure a formal apology from the government for the harm caused by the drone strike, and to secure compensation for the victims and their families.The operator was grateful for the opportunity to work towards making amends, but he knew that the damage had already been done. He struggled with the weight of his guilt, and with the realization that his actions had caused lasting harm to innocent people.In the years that followed, the operator withdrew from his work as a drone operator and instead dedicated himself to working on behalf of victims of war and violence. He used his experiences to educate others on the human cost of war, and to advocate for greater accountability and transparency in military operations.But as he approached the end of his life, the operator was forced to confront one final, shocking twist. He received a letter from an unknown source, revealing that the drone strike that he had been responsible for had actually been ordered by a high-ranking government official for political gain.The revelation shook the operator to his core. He had always believed that the drone strike had been a necessary and justifiable action, taken to prevent future harm to innocent people. But now, he realized that he had been used as a pawn in a larger political game.The operator was left to grapple with this new truth in the final days of his life. He knew that he could never undo the harm that had been done, and that he would carry the weight of his guilt and shame with him until the end.But he also knew that his experiences had given him a unique perspective on the human cost of war, and that he had a responsibility to share his story and work towards a better future. In the end, he found solace in the knowledge that his actions had made a difference, and that he had fought to make the world a more just and peaceful place for all.As the operator continued to work on behalf of human rights, he received an unexpected call from an unfamiliar number.

His story served as a beacon of hope and a reminder that even in the face of tragedy and hardship, it is possible to make a positive impact on the world.The USS Operator's legacy had a profound impact not only on the military but on society as a whole. It sparked a nationwide conversation about the use of drones in warfare, and the importance of ethical considerations in military operations.Policymakers took note of the public's concerns and began to implement stricter regulations and guidelines for the use of drones in combat. The military also began to prioritize the development of technologies that would allow for more precise and targeted strikes, minimizing the risk of civilian casualties.The operator's story also inspired a new generation of military personnel, who saw in him a model of service and dedication to both country and humanity. The USS Operator became a sought-after assignment for young officers, who saw it as a way to honor the operator's legacy and continue his work towards a more just and peaceful world.The battleship's crew also felt a strong sense of pride in their ship's namesake. They took their responsibilities very seriously, knowing that they were not only serving their country but also upholding the operator's legacy.Years later, as the USS Operator sailed towards its final destination, its crew reflected on the ship's remarkable history. They thought of the operator's courage and dedication, of the battles they had fought and the lives they had saved.As the ship was decommissioned, the crew gathered on the deck for a final farewell. They raised their hands in salute, honoring not only the ship and its legacy but the operator and all those who had served alongside him.The USS Operator may have been just a battleship, but its legacy had left an indelible mark on the world. It had reminded us of the power of human courage and dedication, of the importance of considering the human cost of war, and of the responsibility we all have to work towards a more just and peaceful future.As the USS Operator was decommissioned, the army was already planning its next moves. One of the most significant changes that occurred was a shift towards ""woke"" politics. The military began to promote itself as a more inclusive and diverse institution, actively working to recruit and support individuals from marginalized communities.While some welcomed this change, others were skeptical. Critics argued that the army was simply using ""woke"" politics as a way to improve its public image, without truly addressing the structural issues that had led to systemic inequalities within the institution.For example, while the army touted its efforts to recruit more women and people of color, it still struggled with issues like sexual harassment and racial discrimination. Many argued that the army needed to do more than just pay lip service to diversity and inclusivity - it needed to actively address and rectify these issues.Others also questioned the army's newfound focus on ""woke"" politics, arguing that it was distracting from the more pressing issues facing the military. For example, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the rising threat of cyber warfare required the army's full attention and resources, and some believed that the army's focus on diversity and inclusivity was taking away from these efforts.Despite these criticisms, the army remained committed to its new approach. It launched new initiatives to recruit and support women and people of color, such as mentorship programs and targeted outreach efforts. It also instituted new policies to address issues like sexual harassment and discrimination.As the years went on, the army's efforts began to bear fruit. More and more women and people of color joined the military, and the institution became more diverse and inclusive. The army was also able to make progress on other issues, such as cybersecurity and modernizing its weaponry.However, the debate over ""woke"" politics in the military continued to rage on. Some argued that the army's focus on diversity and inclusivity had led to a culture of political correctness and a lack of focus on the core mission of the military. Others argued that the army had made important strides towards creating a more just and equitable institution, and that it was necessary to continue these efforts.In the end, the truth likely lay somewhere in between. While the army's focus on ""woke"" politics may have been driven in part by a desire to improve its public image, it was also a response to the very real issues of systemic inequality and discrimination within the institution. The army had made progress on these issues, but there was still much work to be done.As the USS Operator sailed into the sunset, its legacy served as a reminder of the importance of both courage and ethics in military operations. The army's new focus on diversity and inclusivity was a step in the right direction, but it needed to be accompanied by a continued commitment to transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights.The military could not simply use ""woke"" politics as a way to make itself look better. It needed to actively work towards creating a more just and peaceful world, both within its own ranks and beyond. Only then could the legacy of the USS Operator truly be honored, and the sacrifices of all those who had served in the military truly be recognized.As time went on, the army began to recognize the need for a more holistic approach to promoting justice and peace. It became clear that simply recruiting and promoting diversity was not enough, and that more systemic changes were needed to address issues like discrimination and inequality.The army began to invest in education and training programs aimed at promoting cultural competency and empathy. Soldiers were encouraged to learn about and respect the cultures of the people they were serving, and to approach conflict with a focus on understanding and dialogue rather than aggression.At the same time, the army continued to innovate and modernize its operations. It invested in cutting-edge technology and weaponry, and began to explore new approaches to conflict resolution, such as diplomacy and international cooperation.The legacy of the USS Operator continued to inspire and guide these efforts. Its story served as a reminder of the dangers and costs of war, but also of the power of human determination and resilience in the face of adversity.And as the army continued to evolve and grow, it never lost sight of the need for justice and peace. It remained committed to the values that the USS Operator had embodied, and to the belief that a better world was possible - one where the costs of war were minimized, and where all people could live in safety, dignity, and respect.In the end, the USS Operator became more than just a battleship. It was a symbol of hope and progress, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, humanity could rise to the challenge and create a better future. Its legacy served as a beacon of light for generations to come, inspiring soldiers and civilians alike to continue to work towards a more just and peaceful world.As time went on, the army began to recognize the need for a more holistic approach to promoting justice and peace.

Its legacy served as a beacon of light for generations to come, inspiring soldiers and civilians alike to continue to work towards a more just and peaceful world. As the years went by, the USS Operator continued to serve with distinction, traveling the world and promoting peace and stability wherever it went. But then, one day, the unexpected happened - an alien invasion.The invasion came suddenly and without warning, catching the world off guard. The alien ships were massive, and their weapons were far more advanced than anything humanity had ever seen. Cities were destroyed, and millions of people were killed or displaced.As the world struggled to mount a defense, the USS Operator was called into action. Its crew knew that this would be their greatest challenge yet, and that the fate of humanity hung in the balance.The ship's advanced weaponry and technology proved to be a match for the alien ships, and its crew fought valiantly to protect their planet and their fellow human beings. The battles were fierce and intense, and the fate of the world hung in the balance.But through it all, the USS Operator and its crew never wavered. They fought with all their might, determined to protect their planet and their fellow human beings from this terrifying threat.As the battles raged on, the world watched in awe and amazement. Here was a symbol of humanity's resilience and strength, a reminder that even in the face of unimaginable adversity, we could still stand up and fight for what was right.And in the end, the USS Operator emerged victorious. Its crew had saved the world from destruction, and their bravery and courage had inspired millions around the globe.The alien invasion marked a turning point in human history. It showed that there was more to the universe than we had ever imagined, and that we could no longer take our place in it for granted. But it also showed that we were capable of coming together and fighting for a common cause, that we could overcome our differences and unite in the face of a common threat.In the years that followed, the USS Operator continued to serve as a symbol of hope and progress, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, humanity could rise to the challenge and create a better future. Its legacy lived on, inspiring generations to come to continue the fight for a more just and peaceful world - one where all people, no matter where they came from or what they believed, could live in safety and dignity.The USS Operator became more than just a battleship - it was a beacon of hope for humanity. Its legacy inspired the next generation of military personnel to continue to serve with distinction and honor, always striving to promote peace and stability wherever they went.As the world recovered from the alien invasion, the military and its policymakers began to consider the lessons learned. They recognized the importance of working towards a more just and peaceful world, and the need to minimize the costs of war on civilians and non-combatants.The USS Operator became a powerful symbol of this new era, a reminder that even the most advanced military technology was no match for the power of compassion, empathy, and understanding.And so the ship's legacy lived on, inspiring people around the world to work towards a brighter future. As the years passed, humanity continued to face new challenges and threats, but the legacy of the USS Operator remained a source of strength and hope.In the end, the ship became more than just a battleship - it was a symbol of humanity's ability to rise to the challenge and create a better world for all. Its legacy lived on, inspiring generations to come to continue the fight for a more just and peaceful world - one where all people, no matter where they came from or what they believed, could live in safety and dignity.As the USS Operator continued to serve as a symbol of hope and progress, the military continued to make strides towards inclusivity and diversity. And in a groundbreaking move, the ship's first female captain was appointed.Captain Laura Rodriguez was a decorated military veteran with years of experience in the field. She had served in several combat zones and had received numerous commendations for her leadership and bravery. Her appointment was met with enthusiasm by many who saw it as a step forward for gender equality in the military.But not everyone was pleased with the decision. A group of angry white cis-men, feeling threatened by the military's progress towards inclusivity and diversity, took to social media to voice their disapproval. They claimed that the army was ""going woke"" and that Captain Rodriguez was appointed simply to meet a diversity quota.Their anger only intensified when the military responded with a statement supporting Captain Rodriguez's appointment and reiterating their commitment to inclusivity and diversity. The group's rhetoric grew more extreme, with some even calling for violence against the military and its leaders.The military responded swiftly, taking steps to ensure the safety of its personnel and reiterating its commitment to creating a culture of respect and inclusivity. The USS Operator's crew, including Captain Rodriguez, remained undeterred by the hateful rhetoric and continued to serve with distinction and honor.In the face of adversity, the USS Operator continued to serve as a beacon of hope and progress. Its legacy inspired soldiers and civilians alike to work towards a better future, one where all people, regardless of their gender, race, or background, could live in safety and dignity.And as the world continued to face new challenges, the USS Operator remained a source of strength and inspiration for generations to come. Its legacy would live on, inspiring humanity to continue to strive towards a more just and peaceful world - one where all people could live with respect, dignity, and equality.As Captain Rodriguez continued to lead the USS Operator with distinction and honor, a shocking revelation came to light: she was transgender.For some, this was a non-issue. They recognized that Captain Rodriguez was a highly skilled and capable leader, and her gender identity had no bearing on her ability to do her job.But for others, particularly TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), this was a deeply troubling development. They saw Captain Rodriguez's gender identity a
s a threat to their ideology, and they began a campaign of harassment and discrimination against her.Captain Rodriguez found herself at the center of a vicious attack from both the TERFs and the angry white cis-men who had previously criticized her appointment. She received threatening messages and was the subject of hateful social media posts.The military once again responded swiftly, taking steps to ensure Captain Rodriguez's safety and making it clear that discrimination against any member of the military would not be tolerated. Captain Rodriguez remained undeterred, continuing to lead the USS Operator with grace and determination despite the hateful rhetoric.As the situation unfolded, many began to see the USS Operator as a symbol of hope and progress in the face of adversity. The ship and its crew stood as a testament to the importance of inclusivity and diversity, and the military's commitment to creating a culture of respect and equality.But the attacks against Captain Rodriguez continued, and the TERFs' hateful rhetoric began to spread beyond the military community. They argued that transgender people had no place in society and should not be allowed to serve in any capacity, let alone lead a battleship.The situation came to a head when a group of TERFs organized a protest outside the USS Operator's base, calling for Captain Rodriguez's removal from command. But their hateful rhetoric was met with a powerful show of support from the military and the wider community.As the protests raged on, a group of veterans and supporters of the USS Operator formed a counter-protest, holding signs and banners in support of Captain Rodriguez and the ship's commitment to inclusivity and diversity. Their message was clear: hate had no place in the military or in society at large.In the end, the USS Operator emerged as a powerful symbol of hope and progress, a testament to the importance of inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society. Captain Rodriguez continued to lead the ship with distinction, inspiring a new generation of military leaders to embrace a culture of respect and equality.And while the TERFs' hateful rhetoric may have caused harm and pain, it ultimately failed to silence the voices of progress and hope. The legacy of the USS Operator lived on, inspiring humanity to continue to strive towards a more just and peaceful world - one where all people could live with respect, dignity, and equality, regardless of their gender identity or background.As tensions continued to rise, the USS Operator received a distress call from a nearby merchant vessel. A group of pirates, led by the notorious Blackbeard himself, had attacked the ship and taken its crew hostage.Captain Lee wasted no time in rallying her crew and setting out to rescue the hostages. She knew that this would not be an easy task, but she was determined to do whatever it took to bring the hostages home safely.As the USS Operator approached the pirate ship, it was clear that this was not going to be a simple rescue mission. The pirates were heavily armed and ready for battle, and they showed no signs of backing down.But Captain Lee was undeterred. She ordered her crew to prepare for battle and began to strategize their approach. As the two ships clashed, it became clear that this was a fight to the death.The battle was fierce and brutal, with both sides suffering heavy losses. But Captain Lee and her crew fought with a determination and strength that had never been seen before. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, they refused to back down, and eventually, they emerged victorious.The hostages were freed, and Blackbeard and his crew were captured and brought to justice. It was a stunning victory for the USS Operator, and one that cemented its reputation as one of the most formidable battleships in the world.But the victory was bittersweet. The loss of life on both sides was significant, and Captain Lee and her crew were left to grapple with the realities of war and the human cost of conflict.In the aftermath of the battle, the crew of the USS Operator mourned their fallen comrades and continued to work towards a more just and peaceful world. They knew that their work was far from over, and that there would always be new challenges to face and new battles to fight.But they also knew that they had something special - a bond of camaraderie and courage that could never be broken. They were a team, a family, and they would always be there for each other, no matter what.As the USS Operator sailed off into the horizon, its crew standing tall and proud, it was clear that this was not just a battleship. It was a symbol of hope and progress, a beacon of light in a world filled with darkness and turmoil. And it would continue to inspire generations to come, reminding them that even in the darkest of times, humanity could rise to the challenge and create a better future.Despite its storied legacy and powerful presence, the USS Operator met its end in a final act of irony. It was destroyed not by an enemy fleet or hostile force, but by another ""peaceful"" drone strike.The world had changed since the ship was first commissioned, and with it, the nature of warfare had evolved. Drones had become the weapon of choice for many militaries, touted as a way to minimize the human cost of war. But as the USS Operator had shown, even the most sophisticated technology could not completely eliminate the toll of conflict.As news of the ship's destruction spread, the world mourned the loss of a symbol of hope and progress. Many wondered if there would ever be an end to the cycle of violence and destruction that had plagued humanity for centuries.But amidst the sadness and grief, there were also those who saw the destruction of the USS Operator as a wake-up call. They recognized that technology alone could not solve the world's problems, and that true progress would only come through a commitment to diplomacy, cooperation, and a shared vision for a better future.In the years that followed, efforts were made to strengthen international cooperation and reduce tensions between nations. Slowly but surely, progress was made towards a more peaceful and just world.The memory of the USS Operator lived on, not just as a reminder of the costs of war, but as a symbol of the resilience and determination of the human spirit. It served as a call to action for all people to work towards a better world, one where conflict and violence were replaced by compassion and cooperation.And while the ship itself was gone, its legacy would endure for generations to come, inspiring new leaders to continue the fight for a more just and peaceful world. For in the end, it was not the ship itself that mattered, but the ideals and principles it stood for.As the years passed, the USS Operator continued to be remembered as a symbol of hope and progress. Its legacy served as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, humanity could rise to the challenge and create a better future.But as the generations passed, the reasons why the USS Operator was built and the sacrifices made to create it began to fade from memory. The world continued to be plagued by needless wars and conflicts, and the lessons of the past were forgotten.For many, the USS Operator became little more than a symbol of power and strength, a relic of a bygone era when the United States was the world's dominant military force. The ship continued to serve with distinction, fighting pirates and other threats to global security, but its true legacy was all but forgotten.Over time, people began to sing sea shanties about the ship, its name and purpose lost to the ages. The songs told of brave sailors and epic battles, but the true meaning of the USS Operator was lost in the mists of time.As the centuries passed, the world continued to change. The global landscape shifted, and new powers rose to challenge the dominance of the United States. But the USS Operator endured, a constant reminder of a time when America was the undisputed leader of the world.But as the world continued to change, the legacy of the USS Operator was all but forgotten. The ship became little more than a curiosity, a relic of a bygone era. Few people remembered the sacrifices that had been made to create it, or the ideals that it had once represented.For many, the USS Operator was simply a symbol of power and strength, an emblem of American exceptionalism. Its true legacy, the lessons that it had taught about the costs of war and the importance of peace, were lost to the sands of time.But even as the world continued to forget, the legacy of the USS Operator lived on. It served as a reminder of a time when humanity had faced great challenges and overcome them, when people had come together to create a better future.And even though the reasons for its creation had been forgotten, the USS Operator continued to inspire generations to come, reminding them of the sacrifices that had been made to create it, and the ideals that it had once represented. For those who remembered, it remained a symbol of hope and progress, a beacon of light in a world that so often seemed dark and foreboding.In the year 3023, humanity had made significant strides towards peace and progress, but there was still much work to be done. The legacy of the USS Operator lived on, inspiring future generations to continue the fight for a more just and peaceful world. And in a surprising twist, one of the most beloved figures of this era was none other than President Joe Biden.Despite being long gone, Biden's legacy had endured. His administration's commitment to diplomacy and cooperation had set the stage for a more peaceful world, and his dedication to social justice had inspired countless generations to continue the fight for equality and inclusion.The people of the 31st century looked back on the 21st century with a mixture of awe and horror. They marveled at the advances in technology and science, but were horrified by the needless wars and injustices that had plagued that era. They wondered how it was possible for such a great nation to have fallen so far, and how so many could have been blind to the suffering of others.But they also knew that without the struggles and sacrifices of those who came before them, they would not be where they were today. They knew that the legacy of the USS Operator, and of all those who had fought for a better world, was their responsibility to uphold and build upon.And so they did. They continued to push the boundaries of what was possible, working to create a world where everyone could live in safety and dignity. They continued to fight against discrimination and oppression, and they never forgot the lessons of the past.As for the USS Operator, its name had long since been forgotten. But its legacy lived on in the hearts and minds of those who fought for a better world. And in the end, it was destroyed not by war, but by a peaceful drone strike - a fitting end to a ship that had once been a symbol of violence and destruction.And as the people of the 31st century looked back on the past, they were reminded of the fragility of peace, and the importance of never taking it for granted. They knew that the fight for justice and equality was never truly over, and that it was up to each and every one of them to carry the torch forward.So they did. They worked, and they fought, and they never gave up hope. And in the end, they succeeded in creating a world that was better, fairer, and more just than the one that came before. A world that was truly worthy of the legacy of the USS Operator, and of all those who had fought and died for a brighter tomorrow.In the vast expanse of space and time, the earth continued to exist for billions of years after Biden's presidency. But eventually, as all things must come to an end, the sun grew in size and intensity until it consumed everything in its path.The once-vibrant planet was reduced to a lifeless ball of molten rock, the remnants of its former glory now just a distant memory. The USS Operator, along with all the other artifacts and monuments of humanity's history, had long since been reduced to dust and vapor.But even in the face of such destruction and oblivion, the legacy of the USS Operator continued to live on in the collective consciousness of the universe. The ideals of peace and justice that it had stood for continued to inspire and guide civilizations far beyond the reach of earth's sun.As the universe continued to expand and evolve, new forms of life emerged, some of which would never have existed had it not been for the lessons that humanity had learned during its brief existence on earth. And though the planet itself was no more, the spirit of humanity lived on, shaping and guiding the course of the universe for all eternity.And so ends the tale of the USS Operator,
A ship that fought for justice and peace,
Its legacy lives on in the hearts of all,
And its story will never truly cease.From wars and battles to alien invasion,
It faced many challenges without hesitation,
Through progress and setbacks it never lost sight,
Of the need for a future that's bright.Though the ship itself is long gone,
Its name lives on in sea shanties and song,
A reminder of the sacrifice and the fight,
To build a world that's just and right.And as the ages come and go,
And the sun begins to dim and slow,
The legacy of the USS Operator,
Will continue to inspire and captivate her.For though the earth may crumble and fade,
And the universe itself may someday decay,
The memory of this ship will forever endure,
In the hearts of those who strive for something pure.So let us raise a glass to the USS Operator,
A symbol of hope and progress for all,
May its legacy live on forevermore,
And guide us to a brighter tomorrow's shore.",0
"Koujo Sara had always admired the elegance and power of the Yae Miko. As the head of the Yae clan, she had a reputation that preceded her. Sara had always been curious about the Yae Miko's abilities and her enigmatic personality.One day, Sara was walking through the gardens of the Yae village when she heard someone call out her name. She turned around to see the Yae Miko standing a few feet away from her. Sara felt her heart skip a beat as the Yae Miko approached her, her gaze intense and focused solely on Sara.Sara tried to maintain her composure, but she couldn't help but feel flustered as the Yae Miko cornered her against the wall of the garden. The Yae Miko leaned in closer, and Sara could feel her breath on her skin. Sara's heart was racing as the Yae Miko placed her hand on the wall, trapping Sara in place.""You're a curious one, Koujo Sara,"" the Yae Miko said, her voice low and husky. ""You've been observing me for quite some time now.""Sara swallowed hard, unable to respond. The Yae Miko was so close, and Sara could feel her own desire building with every passing moment. Suddenly, the Yae Miko pushed Sara against the wall, pinning her in place. Sara gasped at the sudden contact but couldn't move as the Yae Miko leaned in even closer.""You want to know more about me, don't you?"" the Yae Miko whispered, her lips dangerously close to Sara's ear. ""You want to know what I'm capable of.""Sara could feel her own desire building as the Yae Miko continued to speak. Suddenly, the Yae Miko pulled back, a mischievous glint in her eyes.""Well then, come find me when you're ready to learn more,"" the Yae Miko said, her voice teasing. ""I'll be waiting.""Sara was left breathless as the Yae Miko walked away, leaving her alone in the garden. Sara knew that she had to learn more about the Yae Miko, no matter what it took. And she couldn't wait to find out what else the Yae Miko had in store for her.As Sara walked through the streets of the Yae village, her mind was filled with thoughts of the Yae Miko. She couldn't shake the memory of their encounter in the garden, and she was desperate to see her again.Suddenly, Sara heard someone call out her name. She turned around to see the Yae Miko standing in front of her, a playful smile on her lips.""Well, well, well, look who decided to come find me,"" the Yae Miko said, her voice dripping with amusement.Sara felt her cheeks flush as the Yae Miko approached her. Before she knew it, she was backed up against a wall, the Yae Miko's hand on the wall next to her head.""You're always so curious about me, Koujo Sara,"" the Yae Miko said, her voice low and seductive. ""Don't you want to know what it feels like to be close to me?""Sara's heart was pounding in her chest as the Yae Miko leaned in closer, her breath hot against Sara's skin. Suddenly, the Yae Miko lifted her hand, and with a swift motion, she slammed it onto the wall behind Sara, trapping her in place.Sara gasped at the sudden movement, but she couldn't move as the Yae Miko leaned in even closer.""You're so cute when you're flustered,"" the Yae Miko said, her voice laced with amusement. ""But don't worry, I won't hurt you.""Sara could feel her cheeks burning with embarrassment as the Yae Miko continued to tease her. But she couldn't deny the heat that was building inside of her.Suddenly, the Yae Miko leaned in closer, her lips dangerously close to Sara's.The kiss continued for what felt like an eternity, the passion between the two women growing with each passing moment. Finally, they pulled away from each other, both of them breathless and flushed with desire.The Yae Miko smiled at Sara, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""I think we have a lot to learn from each other,"" she said, her voice low and husky.Sara smiled back at her, feeling a sense of excitement building inside of her. She knew that this was just the beginning of an incredible adventure with the Yae Miko.And as they walked away from the wall, their hands intertwined, Sara couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected passion that had ignited between them. She knew that this was just the start of something truly special.""Are you ready to learn more about me?"" the Yae Miko whispered, her voice sending shivers down Sara's spine.Sara could only nod, unable to find her voice. And then, without warning, the Yae Miko leaned in and pressed her lips to Sara's, the kiss deep and passionate.Sara moaned softly into the kiss, unable to resist the Yae Miko's charms any longer. As the kiss deepened, Sara knew that she was in for an unforgettable night. And she couldn't wait to see what else the Yae Miko had in store for her.",0
"Hermione Granger had always been a creature of habit. Every morning before work, she stopped at the same coffee shop to get her usual order: a tall, nonfat latte with two pumps of vanilla syrup. But one morning, everything changed.As she stood in line waiting for her turn to order, Hermione spotted a familiar face in the crowd. It was Luna Lovegood, an old acquaintance from Hogwarts who she hadn't seen in years.Hermione couldn't help but stare as Luna approached the counter to place her order. She looked just as ethereal and whimsical as Hermione remembered, with her long blonde hair and dreamy expression.But what really caught Hermione's attention was the fact that Luna ordered the same drink as her: a tall, nonfat latte with two pumps of vanilla syrup.As fate would have it, Hermione and Luna ended up sitting at adjacent tables, sipping their lattes and catching up on old times. They talked about everything from work to hobbies to their love lives, and before they knew it, they had been chatting for hours.Hermione found herself getting lost in Luna's words and the way her eyes sparkled with each new topic they discussed. She couldn't help but feel a magnetic pull towards her, as if she was meant to be in this coffee shop at this exact moment.But as much as she wanted to, Hermione didn't know how to express her feelings towards Luna. She couldn't tell if Luna felt the same way or if she was just being friendly. So she settled for the small moments they shared, like stealing glances at Luna's smile or brushing their hands together as they reached for the same sugar packet.Over the next few weeks, Hermione made a point to stop at the coffee shop every morning to see if Luna was there. And sure enough, she was always there, with her bright smile and her latte in hand.Hermione's heart skipped a beat each time she saw Luna, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of longing as she watched her laugh and talk with the other patrons. She wanted to be the one making Luna smile like that, to be the one holding her hand and taking her on walks through the city.Eventually, Hermione mustered up the courage to ask Luna out on a proper date. Luna said yes without hesitation, and they spent the evening strolling through the city, holding hands and talking about their hopes and dreams.It was during that date that Hermione finally worked up the nerve to confess her feelings to Luna. She stumbled over her words, her heart racing with anticipation and fear.But Luna just smiled softly and leaned in to kiss her, their lips meeting in a soft and gentle embrace. And in that moment, Hermione knew that all her pining had been worth it, because she had found her way to the one person who made her heart soar.",0
"Once upon a time, in a world of wizards and witches, there were two young students named Lily Evans and James Potter. They went to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and they were both in the same house: Gryffindor.Lily and James had been good friends for a while, but James had a secret crush on Lily. He thought she was the most beautiful and intelligent girl in the school, and he would do anything to win her heart.One day, during a game of Quidditch, James and Lily found themselves on the same team. They were playing against Slytherin, and it was a tough match. James was the captain of the Gryffindor team, and he was determined to win.As the game went on, James and Lily found themselves flying side by side, dodging Bludgers and trying to catch the Snitch. Suddenly, their brooms collided, and they both fell off, tumbling through the air.They landed on the ground, rolling over and over until they finally came to a stop. As they lay there, catching their breath, James looked at Lily and saw the most beautiful sight he had ever seen. Her hair was tousled, and her cheeks were flushed with excitement.Without thinking, James leaned in and planted a kiss on Lily's lips. To his surprise, she kissed him back, and it felt like a whole flock of magical butterflies were tickling their lips with their wings.From that moment on, James and Lily became inseparable. They would spend their days exploring the castle, sneaking into the kitchens for snacks, and studying together in the library.

ChatGPT petición: ""Daenerys cuenta un chiste malo y Sansa se rie, Arye se exaspera y Robb simplemente suspira tarareando que así es el amor""
Creacion:Después de un largo día de reuniones y discusiones políticas, Daenerys decidió aligerar el ambiente y contar un chiste. ""¿Por qué los dragones siempre prefieren la carne bien cocida?"" preguntó con una sonrisa en su rostro.Todos los presentes, incluyendo a Sansa, Arya y Robb, se quedaron mirándola, esperando la respuesta.""Porque a ellos no les gusta el sabor a quemado"" dijo Daenerys, riendo por su propio chiste.Sansa, que había estado en silencio todo el día, no pudo evitar reírse ante el chiste malo de Daenerys. ""Ese es un chiste tan malo que es bueno"", dijo, con una sonrisa en su rostro.Arya, que estaba sentada al lado de Sansa, frunció el ceño con exasperación. ""Ese chiste fue tan malo que me duele"", dijo, rodando los ojos.Robb, que estaba sentado al otro lado de la mesa, simplemente suspiró y empezó a tararear una canción de amor. ""Así es el amor"", dijo, sonriendo con cariño.Daenerys rió ante las diferentes reacciones de sus amigos. ""Bueno, al menos logré sacarles una reacción"", dijo, divertida.Y aunque el chiste no era realmente divertido, Sansa estaba agradecida por el momento de alegría que había traído a la sala.

"It had been a little over two days since his and the other boys' ChatGPT shenanigans had gotten exposed, and Clyde hadn't talked to Bebe since. She had not texted him all weekend. That would have come as a relief, but given what happened at school on Friday, Clyde could only come to one conclusion. Bebe knew he'd been using ChatGPT to text her and she was passed.Of course, he didn't know that for sure, but it wouldn't be that hard to figure out. Even if she hadn't caught on from the big show of an apology Stan made to Wendy, there was no way she hadn't put two and two together since. After all, Bebe and Wendy talked every day. Wendy was sure to share more details about what Stan had been sending her, and comparisons wouldn't be hard to make. She'd realize that Clyde had been doing the same thing with her and that would be the end of him.So, he had no choice. He had to get ahead of it. The only way to do that was to apologize before Bebe got mad. That way, it would look like he was at least trying to accept responsibility or seek forgiveness or whatever. The only problem was, he was not quite sure how to apologize.He was not sure how Stan had done it. Wendy did not even seem mad when they left school on Friday. (Unsure and a little upset, maybe, but definitely not mad.) He tried to ask Stan about it, but all he had done was nudge him and say ""ChatGPT, dude,"" but that didn't make any sense. ChatGPT was going to be the reason why Bebe would hate him. How could it fix things? Unless…That was it! That was how Stan had gotten Wendy to forgive him! He had ChatGPT write it all out for him, and it worked! It was a stroke of pure genius, and if it worked for Stan, maybe it would work for him, too.Wasting no time, Clyde opened the ChatGPT app on his phone and typed in the prompt ""write a story where a boy named Clyde who tells his girlfriend that he's been using ChatGPT to text her and she forgives him."" The app took a few moments to think about the prompt before coming back to type out the story at lightning speed. It read as follows:""Clyde had always been a shy boy, and he struggled with expressing his feelings. He had been dating his girlfriend, Emma, for months now, but he still found it hard to talk to her about anything that was bothering him. Whenever they would have a disagreement, Clyde would usually retreat into himself and send her text messages apologizing for whatever he had done wrong.One day, Clyde stumbled upon a new tool that would change everything for him. It was called ChatGPT, and it was an AI language model that could generate text messages based on the user's input. Clyde was amazed at how accurate and personal the messages sounded, and he decided to use it to communicate with Emma.At first, Emma was impressed with the heartfelt messages Clyde was sending her. They were so much more expressive than anything he had sent before, and Emma could tell that he was really putting effort into their relationship. But as time went on, Emma noticed something strange about the messages. They were all written in the same style, and they all had a similar tone and voice.One day, Emma confronted Clyde about the messages. ""I don't understand,"" she said. ""How can you write these amazing messages to me all of a sudden? It doesn't sound like you at all.""Clyde hesitated for a moment, but then he decided to come clean. He told Emma about ChatGPT and how he had been using it to communicate with her. ""I just wanted to be able to express myself to you better,"" he said. ""I'm sorry if I was being dishonest.""Emma was surprised at first, but then she smiled and hugged Clyde. ""I forgive you,"" she said. ""I understand why you did it, and I appreciate the effort you put into our relationship. But from now on, let's try to talk to each other directly, okay?""Clyde felt relieved and grateful for Emma's understanding. He realized that he didn't need ChatGPT to communicate with her after all. He just needed to be brave enough to be himself and speak from his heart. From that day forward, Clyde made a promise to himself to be more open and honest with Emma, and their relationship only grew stronger as a result.""Clyde frowned. Since he hadn't written Bebe's name into the prompt, it had randomly generated one for the sake of telling the story. He was going to have to copy and paste all the text into a word document and use the find and replace tool to change all of the ""Emmas"" into ""Bebes."" After all, he didn't want to accidentally use the wrong name during his apology. Bebe certainly wouldn't let him live if he made that mistake again.The rest of the story didn't seem too bad, though. He didn't really like that the chatbot had described him as ""a shy boy"" who ""had trouble expressing his feelings."" If anything, he would describe himself as ""confident"" and ""smooth with the ladies,"" but ultimately that didn't matter. It was just a framing device. What really mattered was the actual apology. As long as he could stick to those directions, then hopefully everything would be okay and Bebe would forgive him just as Emma had in the story.Hopefully.The next morning, Clyde found Bebe by her locker. She didn't seem upset, but she didn't seem particularly happy either. Clyde wasn't sure what to make of that. ChatGPT had not come up when she hung out with Wendy. Clyde was in the clear…No. If he didn't come clean now it would just be a lot worse later. He just had to suck it up and get it over with. Taking a deep, reassuring breath, Clyde walked over to Bebe.Sensing someone approaching her, Bebe looked up from her backpack and smiled upon seeing Clyde. She opened her mouth to say something, but Clyde beat her to the punch.""I need to talk to you."" The smile disappeared from Bebe's face. She wasn't quite upset yet, but she did look concerned.""Sure, what's up?""Clyde squeezed his eyes shut. Time to pull off the Band-Aid.""Look, I know you spent the whole weekend with Wendy and I know she told you that I was the one who told Stan about ChatGPT,"" he said in one big rush, thinking the sooner he got the words out, the sooner it would be over with. ""And yes, I gave him the idea to use it to text Wendy because it was working so well for us. I started using it because I'm a shy boy who has trouble expressing himself. It was easier to use AI to generate text messages to you because it was easier. I just wanted to express my dishonesty and how sorry I am.""It took a few moments for Clyde to force himself to peel his eyes open. When he did, he was surprised to see Bebe blinking at him in confusion.""Wait… What?"" Slowly her expression was morphing into one of anger. Clyde swallowed hard. This wasn't what happened in the story. Still, maybe he could guide it back in the right direction.""Look, I told the truth,"" he said, voice wobbling a bit. ""Can you just forgive me now?""""You've been using ChatGPT to text me?!"" she exclaimed. ""What the fuck, Clyde!""""Alright, you're mad…""""Mad?"" Bebe snapped back. ""Mad does not even begin to describe it! I thought you were being sincere, Clyde! You were so kind and funny and sweet… God damn it, I should have known something was off.""Clyde glanced around. A crowd was starting to gather. This was getting out of hand.""I just wanted to tell you before you could figure it out for yourself,"" he said. ""Now this is the part where you're supposed to forgive me.""""Forgive you?"" Bebe questioned. ""Why on Earth would I do that?""""Because that's what Emma did in the story!""Bebe's face turned a shade of red Clyde was not sure he'd seen before. In an eerily calm tone, she asked, ""who's Emma and what story?""""Emma's my girlfriend in the story ChatGPT wrote to help me break this to you so you wouldn't get upset."" That was the absolutely wrong thing to say.""You used ChatGPT to write your apology!""Right away, Clyde could see where he messed up. With eyes wide, he held up his hands in a protective – yet hopefully placating – gesture.""I didn't have it write the apology,"" he tried to say. ""I just had it write a story…""Clyde didn't have a chance to finish that explanation. Within seconds Bebe had crossed into his personal space. She shouted ""screw you, Clyde Donovan,"" before giving him a swift kick to the balls. Clyde fell to the ground, clutching at his injured genitals as pain exploded behind his eyes.When the pain subsided enough for him to open his eyes, all he could see was Bebe's back as she retreated down the hall. Desperately, Clyde tried to regain his voice to call out to her.""Emma…! I mean, Bebe! Wait! Come back!""However, it was too late. She turned the corner and was out of earshot, leaving Clyde behind, writhing in pain, and encircled by his laughing peers. That was the last time he would ever take advice from Stan Marsh.",0

Dream had always held a gentle admiration for George. They met through a mutual friend and quickly hit it off, bonding over their love of music and video games. As they spent more time together, Dream began to notice the little things about George that made his heart flutter. The way he laughed at his own jokes, the gentle crinkle at the corner of his eyes when he smiled, the way he absentmindedly twirled his hair when he was deep in thought. Dream cherished these moments, holding them close to his heart.But it wasn't until one sweltering Floridian night, lost in the midst of a heat wave, that Dream's feelings for George began to spiral out of control. They were lying on the couch, listening to music and sipping on ice-cold drinks when Dream's hand brushed against George's. It was an innocent gesture, but it sent a jolt of electricity through Dream's body.As the night wore on, Dream found himself lost in thought, his mind drifting to the possibility of something more with George. He couldn't help but wonder if George felt the same way. The thought of confessing his feelings to George made his heart race and his palms sweat.The next day, Dream woke up feeling disoriented and confused. He couldn't shake the feeling that something had shifted between him and George. That feeling only intensified as the day wore on and Dream found himself continuously listening to the same song on repeat, the lyrics working themselves into the very core of his heartache.That evening, as they were chatting on the phone, Dream's emotions got the better of him. ""You do. It's okay,"" he said when George denied doing something. He felt pinpricks of warmth building in his chest. The words rose up faster than he could temper, laced with soft honey, ""you're so cute.""The call fell silent. Dream's heart raced as he waited for George's response. They heard it. The affection in the tone of his voice, different than usual, no trace of humor. The way it came from the hearth below his heart, glowing with secrecy and shame—for George, and George only. They had to have heard it.Dream hung up the phone, his mind in turmoil. He couldn't believe he had let his feelings slip like that. He felt exposed and vulnerable. But he couldn't deny the rush of exhilaration that came with the possibility of something more with George.As the days passed, Dream found himself lost in a spiraling infatuation. He couldn't shake the longing he felt for George, the desire to be closer to him. But the unsent messages piled up on his phone, his heartache growing with each passing day.And through it all, the terrible, terrible weather raged on, mirroring the tumultuous storm of emotions raging within Dream's heart. He knew he needed to talk to George, to confront his feelings and the growing tension between them. But he couldn't bring himself to do it.Days turned into weeks, and the unspoken tension between Dream and George continued to grow. Dream found himself avoiding George, unable to face the truth of his feelings.But eventually, George called him back, asking why he had disconnected earlier. Dream took a deep breath and, with shaking hands, confessed his feelings to George. To his surprise, George didn't pull away, instead telling Dream that he had been feeling the same way.From that moment on, everything changed between them. They started dating, and their love blossomed like a beautiful flower in the midst of a hurricane. The weather outside may have been tumultuous, but their love was strong enough to weather any storm.",0

It was a typical day for Saiki Kusuo, Aiura Mikoto, and Reita Toritsuka when suddenly a group of government officials showed up at their school. Saiki Kusuke, Saiki Kusuo's older brother, was also there, with a look of jealousy on his face.Saiki Kusuo: ""Oh great, just what I needed. More humans to bother me.""Aiura Mikoto: ""Oh my gosh, Saiki! Do you think they're here to capture us and use us for experiments?""Reita Toritsuka: ""That's the only explanation, Aiura. But don't worry, I can call upon my ghost buddies to protect us.""Saiki Kusuke: ""Yes, that's exactly why we're here. We've discovered your secret psychic powers and we need to take you in for testing.""Saiki Kusuo: ""Well, you're wasting your time. I have every power imaginable, including the power to make myself invisible. So good luck finding me.""Aiura Mikoto: ""Saiki, this is serious! What are we going to do?""Reita Toritsuka: ""Don't worry, Aiura. I have a plan.

He doesn't have the power to teleport!""Aiura Mikoto: ""He's just that amazing, Saiki Kusuke! And he's my soulmate, you know.""Saiki Kusuke: ""That's ridiculous, Aiura. He's my brother and he hates human interaction. But I have to admit, I'm pretty jealous of his powers.""Reita Toritsuka: ""Hey guys, look at me! I turned myself into a ghost and now I'm invisible too!""Saiki Kusuo: """,0

Soundwave felt a wave of electricity course through his body as he was struck by another blast from the Autobots' weapons. He stumbled, but quickly regained his balance and fired back, hitting the Autobot in front of him square in the chest. He could feel his energon reserves dwindling, but he couldn't afford to retreat. He had a mission to complete.Soundwave was one of Megatron's most trusted lieutenants, and he had been tasked with retrieving a vital piece of technology from a human research facility. The mission had been going well until the Autobots showed up, as they always did, and Soundwave found himself engaged in a fierce battle.As he dodged another blast, Soundwave realized that he was outnumbered and outgunned. He knew he had to retreat, but before he could make his escape, a net was thrown over him, entangling his body and binding him tightly.Soundwave struggled to break free, but the net was too strong. He was powerless to resist as he was hoisted into the air and transported to the Autobots' base.When he regained consciousness, Soundwave found himself in a dimly lit room, surrounded by Autobots. He struggled to free himself from the restraints that held him down, but his efforts were in vain.Then he heard footsteps approaching, and a figure emerged from the shadows. It was Ratchet, the Autobots' chief medical officer.""Ah, Soundwave,"" Ratchet said, his voice laced with a hint of satisfaction. ""You're awake. I've been looking forward to examining you.""Soundwave glared at him, but said nothing. He knew he was at the mercy of the Autobots, and he had no choice but to cooperate.Ratchet began to examine Soundwave's body, checking for any life-threatening damage. Soundwave remained silent, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as Ratchet probed his body with his medical instruments.Then Ratchet paused and looked up, a look of surprise on his face.""What is it?"" Soundwave asked, his voice cold and monotone.Ratchet hesitated for a moment before speaking. ""There's something inside you, Soundwave. Something that wasn't there before.""""What do you mean?"" Soundwave asked, his sensors scanning his own body.""I mean there's a...a lifeform inside you,"" Ratchet said, his voice barely above a whisper. ""It's still in its early stages of development, but it's definitely there.""
Soundwave's mind raced as he tried to process the information. A lifeform? Inside him? It couldn't be possible. He had no memory of being implanted with anything.""What kind of lifeform?"" he asked, trying to keep his voice steady.""I'm not sure,"" Ratchet admitted. ""It's still too early to tell. But we need to get it out of you. It could be dangerous.""Soundwave knew he had to act quickly. He couldn't let the Autobots discover the truth about the lifeform inside him. But how could he escape when he was trapped and outnumbered? To be continued...",0

Dean Winchester and Castiel were both excited to start their new jobs as camp counselors for the summer. As they walked into their shared cabin, they both quickly rushed to grab the top bunk.""Wait a minute, Cas,"" Dean said, holding up a hand. ""We need to decide who gets the top bunk and who gets the bottom bunk. I'm willing to let you have the top bunk if you can answer this question: what's the capital of Wyoming?""Castiel furrowed his brow in thought. ""Is it Cheyenne?""Dean smirked. ""Nice job, Cas. Looks like you get the top bunk.""Castiel looked pleased with himself as he climbed up to the top bunk. ""I have to admit, I'm surprised you didn't try to cheat and make up a fake question.""Dean chuckled. ""Nah, what's the fun in that? Besides, I'm pretty sure I would have lost if I did that. You're one smart dude, Cas.""As they settled into their bunks for the night, Dean couldn't help but feel a little bit smitten with his new coworker. Maybe this summer was going to be even better than he had imagined.",0

Once upon a time, there was a lost girl named Eira, who wandered through the forest, searching for her way home. She had been separated from her family during a sudden storm, and had been wandering for days without food or shelter.As she stumbled through the undergrowth, Eira suddenly came upon a clearing, where she saw a giant sitting atop a large rock. The giant looked down at her with a curious expression, and Eira felt a shiver run down her spine.But the giant was not a cruel creature, and he beckoned for Eira to come closer. ""What brings you to my forest, little one?"" he asked kindly.Eira explained her situation to the giant, and he nodded thoughtfully. ""I may be able to help you,"" he said. ""But first, you must do me a favor. You see that tree over there?"" He pointed to a nearby oak, which was home to a magical bird that sang the most beautiful songs in the land. ""Bring me one of its feathers, and I will show you the way home.""Eira nodded eagerly, grateful for the chance to escape the forest. She set off towards the tree, but as she approached, the bird suddenly flew away, leaving only a single feather behind.Eira picked up the feather and returned to the giant, who took it from her and held it up to the sky. Suddenly, a beam of light shot out from the feather, illuminating the forest and causing the ground to shake.When the light faded, Eira found herself standing in front of her home, with her family waiting for her with open arms. Overwhelmed with gratitude, Eira turned to thank the giant, but he was nowhere to be seen.Some say that the giant was merely a figment of Eira's imagination, conjured by her desperation to find her way home. But others believe that he was a magical being, sent to guide lost souls through the forest and into the light. And to this day, the magical bird still sings in the oak tree, its melodies echoing through the forest for all to hear.",0

Chuuya Nakahara watched as Dazai Osamu sat across from him, sipping a cup of coffee and smiling that infuriating smile of his. They were at their favorite cafe, the one that overlooked the river and had the best view of the city.“What’s on your mind, Chuuya?” Dazai asked, setting down his cup.Chuuya frowned. “I just got a call from the boss. He wants us to take on a new case.”Dazai’s eyes lit up. “A case? How exciting! What’s the assignment?”Chuuya sighed. “There’s been a series of robberies at high-end jewelry stores in the city. The boss wants us to investigate.Dazai raised an eyebrow. “And what’s the problem with that?”Chuuya glared at him. “The problem is that every time we work together, we end up bickering like an old married couple.”Dazai chuckled. “Is that what you’re worried about? Don’t worry, Chuuya. We’re professionals. We can put aside our personal differences and work together to solve this case.”Chuuya rolled his eyes. “Fine. But if you make one more sarcastic comment, I’m going to punch you.”Dazai grinned. “Oh Chuuya. You know you love me.”They spent the next few days investigating the robberies, questioning witnesses and gathering evidence. As they worked, Chuuya found himself admiring Dazai’s intelligence and quick thinking. He may have been annoying and infuriating, but he was also undeniably brilliant.Finally, they caught a break. A security guard at one of the stores reported seeing a suspicious figure in a black hoodie hanging around the store the night of the robbery. They tracked down the hoodie to a local thrift store, and with a little digging, they were able to identify the suspect.It turned out to be a group of young thieves who were selling the stolen goods on the black market. Chuuya and Dazai were able to apprehend them and recover the stolen items.As they sat in the car, driving back to the agency, Chuuya couldn’t help but feel a sense of camaraderie with Dazai. They had worked together to solve the case, putting aside their differences and working towards a common goal.“Hey, Dazai,” Chuuya said suddenly.Dazai turned to him. “Yeah?”“Thanks. For, you know, not being a complete pain in the ass this time.”Dazai grinned. “Anytime, Chuuya.”And as they drove off into the night, Chuuya couldn’t help but wonder if maybe, just maybe, they could become something more than just colleagues.",0
"Title: Roommate MisunderstandingMike Wheeler and Will Byers had been roommates for a few months now, ever since they both started their freshman year of college. They had quickly become close friends, bonding over their love of Stranger Things and other shared interests. But lately, Mike had been feeling something more for Will, and he suspected that Will felt the same way.One night, they were hanging out in their dorm room, watching their favorite show when Mike mustered up the courage to ask Will out on a date. But before he could get the words out, Will interrupted him.""Mike, I need to tell you something,"" Will said, looking down at his hands. ""I've been seeing someone.”Mike's heart sank. He had been so sure that Will felt the same way about him. He tried to hide his disappointment and forced a smile.""That's great, man. Who is she?""""It's not a girl, it's a guy,"" Will replied, still avoiding eye contact.Mike felt a surge of jealousy and anger. How could Will be seeing someone else when he had been pining after him for so long?""Is it serious?"" Mike asked, trying to keep his tone neutral.""I don't know, we've only been on a few dates,"" Will said.Mike couldn't take it anymore. He stood up abruptly and headed for the door.""Mike, where are you going?"" Will asked, confused.""I can't do this, Will. I can't be your friend while you're seeing someone else,"" Mike said, his voice cracking with emotion.Will looked hurt and bewildered. ""What are you talking about? You're my best friend, Mike. Why would you end our friendship over this?""Mike turned to face him, his eyes brimming with tears. ""Because I'm in love with you, Will. I have been for months. And I thought you felt the same way, but obviously, I was wrong.""Will's expression softened, and he took a step closer to Mike.""Mike, I had no idea,"" Will said, reaching out to touch Mike's arm. ""I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. I never meant to hurt you.""Mike looked up at him, hope stirring in his chest.""Does that mean you don't like the other guy?"" Mike asked, tentatively.Will shook his head. ""No, I don't. I only went on those dates because I thought you weren't interested in me that way. But now that I know how you feel, I only want to be with you.""Mike felt like a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He stepped closer to Will, and they leaned in for their first kiss, their mutual pining finally resolved.As they pulled away, Will smiled at him. ""I'm glad we had this misunderstanding, Mike. It brought us closer together.""Mike grinned back at him. ""Me too, Will. Me too.""",0
"Deaconess Barbara felt her heart skip a beat as she saw a green-clothed bard now standing by the fountain in Mondstadt's plaza, his teal braids swinging softly into the wind. To be honest, even though they had a very bad first impression regarding the Holy Lyre incident and the rumors surrounding him, she couldn't help but admire the young bard's music and his carefree demeanor, but lately, she had found herself thinking of him more and more often, always listening to his songs from a far distance. She felt something about the bard that makes her very curious about getting along with him. And now, seeing him in person, she couldn't help but feel a flush rise to her cheeks.
Oh Lord Barbatos, please help me with these conflicting feelings within me... I wanted to meet him properly and get to know him after what happened with your precious Holy Lyre, but I'm too embarrassed to approach him after what I had acted in front of him before.
""Hey, Deaconess Barbara!"" Venti called out waving to her as he noticed her dutifully staring at him, ""What brings you here?""Venti actually heard her prayers, since he was the Anemo Archon in question and the Deaconess invoking his Archon name had made him notice her watching him. Not that Barbara actually knew about that, it's better to be kept secret to avoid the Deaconess having a nervous breakdown...and possibly breaking a blooming possible friendship between the two.Barbara shyly walked up to him, feeling a little nervous. ""Oh, just taking a walk,"" she said, smiling sheepishly as she rubbed her neck in nervousness before she composed herself. ""What about you? Are you here to perform?""Venti grinned as his lyre materialized in his hand, and his beautiful eyes sparkled with joy. ""Actually, I was hoping you might join me for a duet.""""A duet?"" Barbara repeated, surprised. ""I... I don't know if I'm good enough for that. I'm not even a pro with instruments unlike you.""""Nonsense,"" Venti said with a cheerful tone, taking her hand with his own gentleness. ""You have a beautiful voice, Barbara. And I think our voices would sound great together.""Barbara felt a shiver run through her as Venti's fingers closed around hers. She had always found him attractive, with his mischievous grin and his sparkling blue-green eyes that reminds her of the grass and the skies. But now, standing so close to him, she could feel her heart pounding in her chest.Together, they began to sing, their voices rising in harmony like birds taking flight. As they sang, Barbara felt a sense of joy and exhilaration that she had never experienced before. It was as if they were speaking a language that only they could understand, and every note they hit sent a thrill through her body. They never even notice the number of people who started to flock to them and wanted to listen to their perfect harmony. Even the birds stopped flying and joined them in song, the melodies blending in with the duo's voices, creating a spectacular performance that could make any Archons cry.When the song ended, people clapped over their beautiful performance as the young Deaconess looked up at Venti, feeling breathless. ""That was... amazing,"" she said softly.The young bard smiled down at her, his eyes sparkling with happiness. ""You were amazing, Barbara. I always knew you had it in you.""Barbara felt a warm glow spread through her chest at his words. Even though she was known by everyone as the Shining Idol of Mondstadt because of her talent, she had never felt so seen, so appreciated, so alive. She wanted to thank her beloved Archon, Lord Barbatos, for letting her meet Venti and getting to know him. And as Venti took her hand once again, she knew that this was the beginning of something new and exciting.",0
"I just got back from your class, so I decided that I should start to type this paper. I am very happy with my classes, even though I feel like they are going to be rather difficult this year, especially my Calculus class. I have a hard time understanding what my professor is saying. I end up have to go home and teach myself most of the information. Well that's enough about school. I just thought about my exgirlfriend. I have very strong emotions about her. I know that she was my first love. But I also am so mad at sometimes. We had talked about me going off to college and we knew that it probably would work about, so we decided that we would date other people. From my experience this really does work out. The first girl that I dated after her was a girl from my waiting job in New Braunfels. I decided that I should tell my exgirlfriend, whose name is Genie, about the girl. This was a very big mistake. Genie came to the restaurant where I worked and caused a big scene. But this isn't the only thing that makes me mad. Things are totally different now that we decided to see other people. We don't get along and we can't talk to each other. I think women need to just make up their mind. They all act like want this perfect gentlemen that does everything for them, but when the actually get that they don't know how to treat it. Usually the go to far and try to take advantage of it and then the guy starts to despise the girl. I don't really wish that things were back the way they were, I just wish that we could still get along. I really miss talking to her. She was a person that I could tell everything to and still feel comfortable about doing so. I am lucky though, because I have a sister that I am very close to. She also goes to UT and she has been a very big help with getting me settled in here in Austin. She only lives a couple of blocks away from me and she is there for me whenever I need anything, as I am for her. This is my freshman year and I am already dreaming that college would be over. It isn't that I don't enjoy Austin or College, it is just that I am tired of school. I wish that there could be a step in your life that you could just skip, but that is impossible. I would love to just be able to be settled in to a good paying job, but since that will never happen I am prepared to work now to enjoy the benefits later. ",1
"It is 9:35 and I am beginning my stream of consciousness writing assignment. I have been at The University of Texas for exactly one week today. The first night I got here was probably the most alone I have ever felt. My roommate is my best friend from the town where I came from, Pearland. My other best friend was visiting us also. I'm not sure why I felt that way, I was surrounded by two of the people I feel most comfortable around. I'm sure it had to do with being in a different town, sleeping in a different bed, etc. I'm sure I'll learn all about that in this class. I didn't realize I would miss my parents as much as I miss them. I'm an only child and I never really considered myself that close to them. Actually, I am very close to my mom about certain things. As I've gotten older sometimes she just feels like one of my friends. At any rate I really miss them. They didn't call that whole weekend, and I realize it was because my mom didn't want to bother me, but it kind of hurt my feelings. So, I called them. This is really going to help out my typing I can tell it's getting faster. It's 9:46 now. I think when I get through with this I'm going to go to my other friends from Pearland's room and watch a movie or something. It's so easy to not mean new people when you already have friends. There's about 25 people from my home town here. I've met new people in my classes and everything, but these are the people I spend all of my time with. We'll see what happens in the future. Before I left Pearland I had been dating a guy who's going to Sam Houston. We weren't that serious, but now I miss him a lot. We were talking about what we were going to do and I had just assumed we would break up because we would be far away but he didn't see it like that. He had like a list of reasons we should or shouldn't stay together. At any rate, I told him I had to experience new things in college, blah, blah, blah, and we basically decided to break up. It's 9:54 but I'll keep writing a little more. I liked this guy on and off for like a year. Well, now I really kind of regret not staying together because I miss him. He came down to Pearland the Wednesday before I left and we hung out. I called him a couple days ago and he didn't sound very happy to hear from me. Okay, well now I'm rambling, I guess now I'm going to have to move on. Oh well we'll see what happens. It's 10:00. This was kind of fun. ",1
"Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 32000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in Houston, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) ",1
"I am not exactly sure how this is supposed to work, but I will give it a try. I am wondering if I am thirsty because I see the Aquafina bottle on my desk. I know I will jump to a random thought soon. I just have not figured out exactly what it is. I am thinking about going to my next class at 5:00 for the Cal discussing, and I am wondering if there will be any good looking guys coming today. There are a few cute ones, but who knows why they won't say hello. I myself don't think that I am totally unattractive, and on occasion I have been known to look hot. Now one of my friends would think that she was cuter and had a better body than me, but I do not think so. So anyhow that makes me think of how we went bowling the other day and that she did look like she had lost some weight because her pants looked good on her. She also has great hair, that never looks clumpy, how does she manage that? O just go to the store and buy any shampoo that I want but not her she buys the most expensive thing at the mall, we are so different, yet so alike. Maybe I just like to put on the image that I don't care when I really do, while she cares and she admits it. Right now I feel like turning on the tv so that I don't fall asleep while I am typing this assignment up. I always get sleepy around this time but I feel so guilty taking a nap because I have so much work that I should be doing. Right now I hear Rosie O'Donnell in the background and they are talking about NYC and now I want to go hang out in New York with my friends and I also want to go each some chocolate chip cookies. I am the biggest chocoholic. But my dad has diabetes, so I have decided that I would start to be cautious about what I ate. Right now I am trying to keep up with everything I am thinking but my fingers cannot move as fast as all my thoughts. I just saw a picture of a finger cut open, and quite frankly that is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen. I am not really sure if I like my nail polish color, it is a cool color, but I am not entirely sure that it looks good on me. Rosie just mentioned dogs which makes me think of my dog, Cleopatra, who I miss very much. She is a black cocker spaniel with white patches on her stomach and, she has beautiful big brown eyes. She is one of the cutest things I have ever seen. She waits for my little brother to come home from school at the window next to our front door. Oh yah I want to download Dr. Dre's new song, but for some reason I cannot remember the name of the song. And I can't get Napster, because of this stupid UT network, so I have to use Imesh, which is not as good as Napster, because I can't just write in the name of a song. I have had quite a bit of computer trouble lately. But luckily it is all fixed and set up now, due to many nice people who have helped me set it up. I am really not computer savvy and my parents always get on my back about it, and I used to not pay attention but now I am thinking that I should, because there are so many cool things that computers can do, and I don't want to miss out. I also want to go shopping, but I don't have money, I want to be like I Dream of Jeanie or Bewitched and just be able to blink in and out of outfits. I saw a Campbell's soup commercial that said soup only has 100 calories. Now I am watching a bit about a wonderful guy who is very loving toward his mother, which makes me think that I could make more of an effort to be better to my parents. Ok my twenty minutes are up so I will stop typing. ",1
"Well, here I am on Friday, September something. Ever since I started college I've had a hard time keeping up with the date. Not really a smart thing to do since I have to stay on top of things here. I need to start keeping a daily planner. I say that everyday but then I forget to do it and it's just one of those things that end up on my mental list of things to do. I'm pretty hungry right now. No, I take that back, I'm not that hungry. I could eat but it's not to the point where I feel like I have to eat. My friend and I are going to lunch today. I'm so glad that I've made a friend that I can hang out with and talk to all the time. It's not the same like my friends at home though. I miss Melissa and Amber. I really don't know why it is that we now talk multiple times to each other everyday but back home we would go days without speaking. We talk about nsync a lot more now too. Typical, we find comfort in them in our time of need. I wonder if the nsync guys would think that we're crazy if they knew that we talked about them everyday and that we have daily arguments about who Justin belongs to and who JC belongs to. They crack me up. Heck, I crack myself up. We talk on the phone and I have Melissa and Amber rolling on the floor with laughter. It's so awesome to make other peole laugh when usually I'm the one doing the laughter. A lot of times I just laugh to be polite. I fake it pretty well, if I do say so myself. I wonder if this assignment has to be broken up into paragraphs? Well, if this is just my one continuous thought then I guess not. Okay, I love my dorm and where we live but for goodness sakes, could somebody please turn up the air conditioning. I think the University is trying to freeze us into studying. I hope they know that they're just freezing me into complaining all the time. And another thing, is it impossible for people to not slam their doors? Really, it doesn't take that much effort to quietly close the door. I should randomly slam my door. I think every hour on the hour, I'm going to slam my door. No, that's not frequent enough. I'll slam the door every twenty minutes and see if they all get the point. Really though, dorm life is not bad at all. My dorm room is so cute and I really like my roommate. No waiting to use bathroom or shower stalls and we have an awesome living room setting. I still don't like to call this place home. Home is where Mom and Wayne are. This is where I reside. It would take a lot for me to consider this place home. I need to do my Biology homework. I wonder if all those scientists know how completely boring their jobs are? The funny thing is that at least they have something to do with their lives. I can't even decide what my favorite color is let alone what the crap I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I'm pretty sure that life as a professional bum is out of the question. Don't think Mom would be proud of me then. Okay, looks like my time is running out and I should finish this on my own rather than be cut off mid sentence. Okay, how do I end this. I really don't know. This was actually kind of fun. Just another way for me to analyze my random, boring, and crazy thoughts. Red Hot Chili Peppers on VH1 now. Got to go. And we're out in 5,  4,    3,   2,   1. Bye! (It says that I can finish writing, but honestly I got a date with a fine young man named Biology)  ",1
"I am very stressed out right now for several different reasons. For starters, I was half way done typing this paper when my computer messed up and everything was erased. Also, I have fake nails which makes it very difficult to type. At this moment, I am trying to write this psychology paper yet all I can think about is everything else I have to do. I wish I had a pen and lots of post it notes with me at all times because I am always thinking of things that need to be done, yet I can never seem to remember them. I am constantly bombarded with thoughts of what books I need to go buy, what sections I need to read for what class, and how I am going to pass this semester living in Castilian. It is wild and very loud which makes it very difficult to study. Also, my ex-boyfriend Derek is in the hospital. He has Multiple Sclerosis and it happens to be very bad right now. I feel so guilty because I have not had the chance to visit him since he has been admitted into the hospital. I think that my mom and I are going to send him some flowers, though. We broke up almost two months ago and he has had a difficult time excepting that fact. It makes me sad to know that he is in the hospital doing absoultely nothing while I am away at college having the time of my life. I don't want him to think I don't care about him anymore or that I have forgotten about him, but this is my own way of really moving on. Last night we had our first date dash for my sorority. I invited this guy named Jordan who lives at Castilian. He is really good looking and we had a lot of fun together last night. Usually I am intimidated by good looking guys, but for some reason I find him very easy to talk to. We also had fun dancing together which is a definate plus because I often feel self-conscious when dancing with good-looking guys. I am a little upset becuse he left me after we got back to Castilian. He told me that he was going to go talk to his friends for a few minutes and that he would be right up. Too bad he came up an hour later when we had already left. I am not even that mad though because I know he feels very bad about it. I am hoping that he invites me to Delt pledge line. I am also very excited because this guy I met and dated at camp this summer wrote me an e-mail! It may sound pathetic but I was really glad to get it. He is a lot older than I am so I was expecting him to forget about me after camp. We are planning on getting married in four years as long as ""college doesn't change me. "" He is a TA at OU and is one of the most interesting guys I have ever met. We share a lot of the same beliefs and have such a good time together. When I graduate from college we are going to move to a beach in Mexico together. We just sarcastically talk about that, but I wouldn't mind it being a reality!! The other night I put some closure on an event that I had needed to for years. It felt really good to do that. And now I am going to put closure on this paper because all I can think about is what I need to do and how I need to be back up at school soon so I can start getting ready for the game. ",1
"The way I feel has always been of interest to me. i have experienced so many emotions that at times my mind seem confused and bogged down with internal conflict. I have some what of a codependent personality and love to have relationships (longlasting perferably) with members of the opposite sex. To be completely honest, sex is usually not the primary motive for me in a relationship. Currently I feel somewhat lonely as all of my friends are currently in relationships that have been very beneficial to them. I live in an apartment which is not as advantageous as it seems. The people at Jester seem to be easily approached and my friends have met far more new people than I. I don't believe I am as happy about being in college for this reason. I love meeting new people. I find it hard to concentrate on work and am constantly thinking about certain people or friends I left behind. I seem to dwell on the past lately. I go on eating binges and then won't have an appetite for days to follow. I work out constantly and lately have been woried about my physical appearance. I many times dwell onthe question ""Why do I not have a girlfriend, why do they not find me attractive. ""  I guess part of the reason I feel this way is simply because as a child I was teased about being overweight. I guess I developed a level of self consciousness as a child and still to this day am woried about my weight. I've tried meeting people but the conventional means just do not seem to work for me. It is hard for me to approach a girl and that tends to bother me somewhat. Personally I tend to avoid large groups simply because id rather get acquainted with a person on a one on one basis. I also worry excessively about my grades. I guess from reading what I wrote my biggest feeling/emotion is lonliness. ",1
"ok, so I guess I just type here. for twenty minutes. Hrm interesting you know I think this will get very boring really fast. (and my roommate asks ""so you just write? anything? crazy dude"") wow. I thought at least something would come but er. Never mind. I do not know really what to write about. great and only a minute and a half into it. er. hrm, maybe write about this computer, or the fact that I do not have one yet. that sucks. in college and I have to either go to a lab or use someone else's computer while constantly I see others around on their own machines. I have a phone call! yay. my 'mentor' telling me about an event in front of ECJ. weird trying to type and talk at the same time about two completely off different things. eh. phone's off. coming on five minutes now. almost. So I was early. you know this can't all be that interesting typing for a solid twenty minutes. most of these papers must be extremely boring. unless someone goes off and just starts telling a story or something. hrm, sounds like maybe something to do. well, it all began a long time ago. well, long in the sense that they were young when it began; that time period to others may just be what they consider a few years or so. (did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window. very annoying I must say) (I need a name. Er, Samsung monitor, ok the character's name is Sam) Sam had been a small child when his father disappeared, therefore he had little memory of him. all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park. nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like. many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person, constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting, except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do. they also told him of when his father was younger; he would disappear for days on end, supposedly off camping or exploring by himself, and would return different. how different, they could not quite say, but something changed in him. , not always for the better. often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks, but after time, he would return to his energetic self. (I notice I seem to misspell quite a bit and even though I try to catch and fix the word as I type it, some words do get through without my notice and I'd rather not go back and change them. Also I tend not to capitalize much when typing. this is probably due to the fact that I have grown to accustomed to writing in Word and it will capitalize certain things automatically; that and I am usually too lazy to remember to do so. ) After Sam's father disappeared the last time, his mother fell into a strange illness. there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness. it was as if something from another world. Something definitely there but not  ",1
"     Today is September 11, 2002. Exactly one year since the attack on the twin towers, the attack on our country occured. Today is a day of sorrow, of mourning, but also a day of pride. As I watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others I was deeply touched. Atfirst I was sad as I thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind. But know, as I have watched as our country has come together, I am extremely proud. I remember at this time last year, American pride was so awesome all across the country. People had their flags out and people just helped each other. People began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country. Today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation, and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process. I can remember exactly where I was when the second plane crashed. I was in my creative writing class and a girl, Emily Momburger, walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers. My teacher turned on the TV and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing. And then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes. We were in shock and I remember I got the chills. I think that I will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me. I remember watching the news as people cried through the streets holding pictures of their loved ones, looking desperately for them all over, just hoping that they weren't in the crash. Today, is a day of remembering though and also a day of forgetting, trying to go on with our daily lives and overcome the terrorism that has overtaken our country.       College life besides the horrific event that we are remembering is going well. I joined TriDelt and am in the greek system. At first I didn't really want to be a tridelt and was disappointed, but now I am really happy. Our pledge class is so amazing and a lot of the girls in it are really cool. We participated in this field day event last saturday and it was really fun. I got to know a lot of the girls better and we bonded. We also went on our pledge retreat that night as well which was a good experience. We were all really exausted but we tried to socialize and get to know each other. Last night I went to this praise and worship thing called Escape. It was at this guys house and there were so many people there. Usually there aren't that many people who go, but last night so many came that we had to go in the backyard. It was awesome even our in the heat. It was so reassuring to see that there are other Christians on this campus and I felt very close to the lord there in that backyard with complete strangers and the dog barking in the background. It is so easy to lose focus here on theis campus, and last night was so helpful for me to really  remember what is really important in this life. I sometimes feel myself getting lost in school and in sorority and greek life, that I'm like I just don't have enough time for my quit times. The fact of the matter is, He should be my number one prioroty, and l;ately he hasn't been. I am working on it though, and we just have to do the best we can. But, I am really excited to be here more and more each and every day. I am meeting so many new people and having so much fun with the old friends that I came here with. We just do th ",1
"hello, here I am trying to figure out what to write for this 'assignment'. Well, let's see, I believe I have a CS quiz in a couple of hours, I should get studying for that. Yeah, that what I'm thinking. I need some print outs for that though. Boy, I wish I could study at my job, this way I wouldn't have had to wake up early in order to study over the quiz material. Oh well, what can one do. My jobs pretty good by the way, its new and the stuff is either easy, or once where I learn. Hence, I have fun. I haven't chatted on MIRC for a long while. Maybe I'll do that at work, it should be fun. Hmmm, I'm just thinking like random thoughts, about nothing specific. My gyming is going fine, hope I get a good looking chest/body over the next month or so, not that I need to show it off or something, just because this way the clothes i wear will I guess look better on me. Anyway, so how much time is up, I think about 15'ish minutes, I need to drink something dude, maybe milk. But nothing is OPEN! well it is like 9am too. I guess people don't have quizzes that have to prepare for. I think I'm going to go to my job kind of early and print out some slides for the CS class quiz it should be easy. and about this whole Coop thing I think I should go check out the companies but not really apply apply I don't want to as yet I think I can make my GPA higher and then apply what do you say well I can't there's no one really who might be able to help me out I just have to think about myself. but CoOp fairs are a great time you get to get all dressed up at stuff but in this HEAT!? hmmmmmmmmm I don't think that would be a good idea. anyway I believe my 20 minutes should be over by now so I'm going to take off.

"I've been here for about three weeks now and its starting to feel a little more like home. I was really scared when I first left, and I questioned myself if I was really ready for this big of a step. Once I got here there was no turning back. I would feel like a failure if I had worked my way to this point and then chickened out. Being away taught me a little about love too. I always knew I loved my parents but that was mainly because it was pretty much understood. Now that we are separated  I know how much they really mean to me. It almost feels like I have lost them and I am thinking about all those things I wish I had said then. I guess that is a good aspect about college because it teaches you to appreciate the things you don't have anymore. Overall I really like it here. I like being responsible for myself and it almost feels like Austin is my home and not my family's. They will have to come to my city to visit me. I really miss my girlfriend Mandi. She is at A&M but she hates it there. She came to visit me here and fell in love with Austin. she is now planning to transfer here as soon as possible. That makes the future look very bright to me. She was the one person who was always there for me in the past year. I really think she is my guardian angel. She came into my life at a point where I was about to be headed downhill. I helped her in a lot of ways too. I am glad that she doesn't like it at A&M but I would rather her be happy than anything. She has called me countless times this semester balling. It frustrates me because there is nothing I can do for her. I just can't wait until we are back together here in Austin. That will be paradise. I can see myself living here for the rest of my life. It has a little bit of everything. If you want beauty, head for the hills,  if you want history, head for the Capitol, and Guadalupe is Texas' little piece of California. I am going back home to Tyler in two weeks. I don't think the town will seem the same. It already seems like the place that I spent my childhood but could never go back to and live. I guess it seems that way because I already know I am staying here for the summers in order to take some summer classes. My parents treat me like an adult now. I had one of the best conversations yet with my dad the first week of school when I was having a hard time. He really treated me like a man and that meant a lot to me. When I go back I plan to really show more respect than I used to. I'm starting to realize that my parents are not going to be around forever. I want to make them proud. ",1
I wish it was Friday actually I wish it was next Friday then I would be going home vacuums really bug me I want to change the channel but I don't want to get up but duck tales really sucks and even though Im not even watching it and just hearing it bugs me I guess that's something you just have to deal with if you're lazy I want to talk to Stephen but I dont want to call him because I called last but he hasn't called me which really doesn't make much sense but guys don't make any sense anyway so its ok I don't want to go to calculus tomorrow but I should because Ive already missed it twice I wish it would rain I want to get caught in the rain I want some Dr pepper but I dont want to go buy some because I don't want to spend the money I want to get an exhaust even though I haven't even found anybody to race up here I should write to Christina I need to check the mail who cares about the kennedys I hope I have some mail but I really doubt it I never get mail my room looks so boring I don't like living in a dorm it really sucks but I guess this is better than jester it's kind of hard to think and write at the same time I hate typing why are her clothes still hanging there what's wrong with using the dryer I need to do laundry double your pleasure double your fun my boobs itch I guess I shouldn't have tanned for so long     ,1
"At the moment, I am tired. I just woke up a little while ago, and I'm writing. I can't stand writing. I don't mind the work. It's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. I was wondering the other day, If college was reall going to change me into the genius I expect to be. I mean, when I get out into the career world, will I know ""everything"" I need to know about my job? Will I have to know everything? Will there be room for training and learning? Confusion! I guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. I guess what I'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. As I sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, I can't help but realize how much I miss my family back home. Although college is my main priority and the fact that I don't care what anyone thinks about me, I can't help but wonder if my family thinks I can make it or not, if I have what it takes. That is always in my mind somewhere. I, myself, know I can make it. I know I have what it takes to succeed. However, when I do graduate and get a career job, is that it? Is that going to be my life until I retire. I am very spontaneous and I won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. I stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and I read the assignment again. I have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. I'm not a scientist and I don't care to be. I just want to be happy. ",1
"Im tired, stressed and I really don't feel all that good right now. my stomach hurts but Im tired. I feel pressured. pressure from everywhere. school, work, life. how do I know what Im doing with my life is what I was meant to do?  I love amy she means the world to me. I wish that I hadn't broke up with her last year. it ruined a lot of things in my life. but I thought that I would be happier with someone else and I was for a short period of time but not a day went by that I didn't think about amy and wonder if she is really the one. I miss my grandpa who died on the first day of school this year. Ive had a really tough time dealing with his death. I guess I just thought that he would never die. after all grandparents aren't supposed to (I think). I just have a hard time dealing with death. but paw paw is most assuredly in heaven right now looking down on me making sure Im living my life as a Christian. I will see him again, I know!  the thing is that paw paw really loved amy and she loved him. we were together for almost two years before I broke up with her for selfish reasons which I never found out what they were. I hate to be alone so I started dating janna who is a nice girl but I knew that it was all wrong but I enjoyed the companionship,  which is wrong but was good because it helped me to realize that amy is the one for me. the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with. paw paw knew it. how ironic it was that I broke up with janna only one day before paw paw died and began seeking love from amy. he would have wanted us together. but I messed up and things are hard now,   she still loves me but she is afraid to trust me. I need her!  ",1
"I didn't know there was a timer on  this thing. This is kinda weird typing all my thoughts. My ring is broken. My ice cream is really good. That place down stairs has good ice cream. I'm tired. I need to go look for a new job today. I am going to 3 different Chili's to apply. I like my mousepad. My roommate just came in and it scared me. She just turned on the water. I'm thirsty. This ice cream is making me thirsty. I want to go home today. I miss my friends and family. But I'm not going to go home today. I am going to stay here. 20 minutes of writing your thoughts is a lot of time. which means a lot of thoughts. I have to read like 3 chapters for oceanography because I keep forgetting to read. So now I'm really really behind. I need to catch up so I don't fail. I need to go to the grocery and get some more food and drinks for in here. I'm almost out of Cokes because I go through them so fast. My roommate is talking to me about laundry. I haven't done laundry here yet. I went home last time to do it (to Round Rock). She said the washing machines are really small and the dryers are really big. We just swept in here. It gets dirty pretty fast. And you don't even notice. I want a College of Education t-shirt. I saw one today but it was for the education council. and I don't think I want to join that. I don't like ""counseling"" haha. But really I don't like speaking in front of people or anything. So I'm sure that would not be fun for me. But-I don't know what I am talking about right now. Klint just came online. Yay. He must have just woken up. It's kinda late. But he wakes up late. That's ok though. I wish I could sleep late. I have classes too early to sleep late. It's kinda weird because I don't like to go to bed early. So it would be really good if I had late classes. Education Council sounds like you just bond with the teachers and stuff. Like student council. So yeah-not for me. I like Klint. I have not seen him in a while. I also have not seen Chris Russell in a while. My phone is ringing. Stop ringing. It's Carl. I have not talked to him in forever. Sara likes her pants. I have some like those. I got them from Target. I want to go shopping. I don't have any money though. I saw Tiffany's sister in class the other day and I didn't know if it was her. So I didn't know whether or not I should say hi. But she had her eyebrow pierced so I didn't say hi. And I told Tiffany that and she said I was lucky that I didn't say hi to her because she would have been really mean to me. That sucks. I don't like mean people. I hate making friends. It's so hard to be able to tell who your real friends are or not. I don't really have any friends here yet. I met one guy. And I have a few other friends who I see off and on. But still. All my friends left. Which is not very cool. I want to burn a CD. I have a whole bunch left. I need to renew my internet service. It doesn't expire til Sept. 23rd though. I need to look for those blue books. My spanish teacher said we need some for monday. And I have some because Jenny gave them to me. The lawns outside must be getting mowed. I hear a lawn mower. Anywho Desiree needs a blue book so I need to find them so I can give her one. So yeah. I like the pictures in my room. They remind me of my friends. I miss them. Jenny is having a lot of fun I think. She has 5 roommates but they all share an entire floor. And there are 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a living room and everything. That would be cool. I wish I had money to buy that here. But next year I am getting an apartment with Katie I think. She wants to get fish but I don't like fish. They die too easily. Katie gave me a big Texas poster. She knows that I hate museums and stuff like that and she went to the Bob Bullock museum with her family and got me that poster. To be funny. So now I'm going to put pictures of my friends like riding the horses and stuff. I just realized that my psych class is not 2 hours long. It's only 1 and a half hours. I just thought we got let out early all the time. 20 minutes is a long time. Although it seems a lot shorter when you type everything you're thinking. But that's still a lot of thoughts. I would hate to grade these things. Almost over. Only 20 seconds left. I want more ice cream so hurry up and finish. I need to get a new pencil sharpener. ",1
"I just met you. How can this feeling be?  It is a happy feeling. Its just awkward. I haven't felt it in awhile, at least since another soul and I grew apart. Things just faded. Two different people, two different lives. But now the emotion lurks once more in my heart. I try to fight it, but I can't. Something tells me to follow my heart, submit, and give in to the strong, enticing feeling that is just starting a war inside me. Thoughts just continuously rumble through my head; they won't stop. There's no control. I can't change how I feel. This is a crazy world. Everything just seems upside down. There is too much to think about in life. Who ever said it would be this complicated?  I wish there were just a secret to life and somebody would fill me in. I could just do anything I wanted to do. Pleasure could be my sole guide down every path in this extensive journey. The thought of consequences would never even enter my mind. I could live life day by day, and my only obligation would be to live. I would just enjoy life and breathe it in. Too many people today miss out on the beauty of their surroundings, the people they come in contact with and their environment. If a person merely goes through life only seeking material success, where is the true worth in that life?  That person would miss out on everything with true meaning and depth. Therefore, he or she is not really living but merely becoming a trained robot to fit into the machine of our material world. Things are so weird now. It seems that people have lost site of their morals and are only living to climb the corporate ladder. What kind of life is that?  Oh well, everybody is different. What is important to me may not be important to others. I went to Mount Bonnel yesterday, and it was breath taking. I watched the sun set and the stars and moon come out. There was a gentle breeze that would pass over my face and lips and blow through my hair. At that moment, all stress seemed to disappear. It was complete tranquility and bliss. It made me want to just sit up on the mountain, take in the view, let my thoughts run free, and just live. ",1
"Well my experience so far up in this large city has been one I won't forget. I've several new people but most of the people I am with are the one's that I have known all my life. It's amazing how much you can share with your roomate although I've known her all my life. I just feel bummed cause I'm so far from home I miss my parents and most of my family. And of course there are boy problems too. John who I have liked forever doesn't even give me the time of day. Which totally bites. I just wish he would notice me and then there is my kind of boyfriend back home whom I need to let go but right now he is the only thing that is holding me up from completely losing it. It's scary up here. And being mexican really doesn't help either. I feel like an ugly duckling up here. I feel that people are looking at me different because i don't look like them. Or maybe I'm just very parnoid about meeting new people. It's funny though, i have been waiting for this experience for most of my teenage years and now that it is here I just want to go home to the normal for me at least. It is just so frustrating when your sitting in a classroom of more than 600 people and you have no one to talk to. I know i should start meeting new people and all but it's just very scary for me and I don't even know why. I evy alot of people up here. I evy those that can just sit next to a person and be like   hey my name is becky   or whatever. That just one of my many problems. I know they are stupid but they really freak me out when I start to think about them. SO most of the time i try to stay away from things like this that will make me think of all that is confusing in my life. What I do not know is if i can live here in austin and go to school here for 5 years. When I came to orientation at the business college they had posted in big letters   Welcome Class of 2007   Me and my roomate were like what we have to be here 5 years that is crazy. Everyone that I left behind back home all told me that these were going to be the best years of my life. And that i was going to meet my life long friends. So far I truly believe that all of us from San Benito will remain friends the rest of our lives. I guess you could say that we are each others shoulder to lean. We always go out together, eat together, and just hang out together. I know it is against school policy and all but before school started we had a big sleep over and everyone just hung and enjoyed each others company. I liked that alot. I think it brought us closer and we learned to appreciate that connection we had with one another. I just know they will be there when I break down and cry about everything that I have been building up inside my head. Thank God i knew my roommate because my other girlfriend is having some difficulty with her roommate and I'm just fortunate not to have that problem. It's like Diana and me our soulmates we just didn't realize it til now. It's funny cause we share the same thoughts about most stuff. And we even spend countless hours talking about boys and other things bothering us, but it is mostly boys! I love her a great deal and I am extremly grateful for her. I also Have a friend back home who I used to work with and he is great too. He calls me and leaves me inspirational messages on my phone which always brings  a smile to my face when I'm struggling to get to class in the blazing hot sun. But God blessed me with really great friends. ",1
"     I wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, I am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy. I am surprising myself lately though. I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all. I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. I wonder when life is going to get easy. I have been working hard since I was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. Trying is the key word. Sometimes I think I missed out in high school. I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do. If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in England, Surrey was  nice. London is amazing. I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it. I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. I enjoy taking drives though. When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. Kind of  like sailing. Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. I feel so  stupid. But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid. too many to list. I can  not wait to go to the football game. I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen. Christina Aguilera's CD is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. It is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here I am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like  70 unbelievable this is supposed to be Texas. I am so glad my Aunt and her  partner are here , even if Lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see Linda. I love accents, I wish I had an english accent. for some  reason I especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love. Another reason I want to move to London, I love the way they talk. I  also love Orlando Bloom who also lives in England, he is gorgeous. But  sometimes I wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. That irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet. They are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet  deal actually, I wish someone would pay me to be someone else so I could live a  fairy tale. Sometimes I wish life were like a movie, not like the Faculty though. more like Kate and Leopold. Mostly love stories, that would be amazing. Though  at the same time it might be too predictable. One can wish though right. I wonder  what I am going to be when I grow up, I mean really grow up. I really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if I have a personalitly, or if I  am just here. How is it possible for people to exist anyways. I don't know if I buy  the whole evolution thing or the Bible. If the Bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from. And if  vice versa then how did the Bible come about. I still  believe there is a God because I think it is important to have something to believe  in. But sometimes I think what if God wasn't real. There would be many times I  would be lost in my life in that case. For some reason. I think there is some sort of  force that looks out for people,  ",1
"I feel so blessed to be here right now. the game tonight was so fun. I can't believe that we won 65-0. that's such an incredible win. poor north Texas guys. They must feel pretty embarrassed. I feel so content here and settled even though I've only been here a couple of weeks. I think that I am really getting comfortable with all of my classes and the people around me and am really getting to feel like this is my home. I miss judd so much. the time we get to spend together is never enough. its funny to me how I haven't missed my parents at all but I think about and miss judd all the time. I just love the way he makes me feel, so warm and so complete. I'm so glad that I have friends here like oshley and that I totally lucked out with allyson as my roommate. I'm so relieved that me and my friend ben worked out the awkwardness between us so that we're still good friends. I was so surprised when I saw him on the jumbotron tonight. I feel so proud of him. I can't stop thinking about how lucky I feel to be here. I just love it here and can't wait till judd gets here. I think I want to convince all my friends still in high school to go to school here. Its just so amazing. the people and the opportunities and the culture make this place so amazing. living in new braunfels was such a bubble. this feels more like the real world. I know that people say college is still a bubble and I think they're right, but its more of a realistic world than life in new braunfels. I miss high school, but just the idea of knowing everybody and where everything was and the comfort of it being my hometown. at the game last night, I felt a little sad that I wasn't down there on the track cheering. now that judd and I were together, part of me wishes I could go back and have that ultimately typical high school relationship - the varsity football player and the varsity cheerleader. it would've been so much fun to have that sort of experience!  I'm just a little jealous of those girls down there on the track because I feel like they aren't taking advantage of what an incredible opportunity they've got down there. those were the best times of my life thus far. I know that better are sure to come in my years here at Texas, but I just wish that I could go back, just for one Friday night, and cheer under the lights and yell for the boys and be right down there with judd. it makes me so sad that I probably won't ever get to perform like that again. my dancing and cheering days are over and I just want them back. its not that I miss the actual belonging to the cheerleading program, I just miss being in the spotlight and performing for the fans. I thrive off of that and now I feel a little empty since I don't get to do it anymore, and I especially feel it when I see the new girls down there on the track. I feel kind of dumb reminiscing so much on high school memories now that I'm in college because all I ever talked about in high school was how I couldn't wait to get away from the drama and just come to college to be just a normal student. granted I definitely don't miss the drama of high school, I do miss the girls and the games of high school cheerleading.  the more I keep thinking about this the more sad I feel. I think the biggest problem is how much I miss judd. we spent so much time together this summer and I just miss him not always being there to hold whenever and wherever I needed him. I can't believe I fell in love with him. he's just an amazing guy. the one thing that scares me about him that makes me feel nervous is his uncertainty about his Christianity. its so hard for me to explain my faith to him because it was just engrained in me and I was too young to question it and now its just a part of who I am and I'm so thankful for that. but judd didn't grow up going to church or with any faith instilled in him so now its hard for him to understand or trust anything that he can't prove really is there. I think its a matter of pride. The idea of giving himself to someone else that he doesn't really know is there doesn't settle well with him. or maybe its a trust issue. Or maybe both. its just hard because I can't really understand how he can NOT have belief, and he doesn't understand how I CAN. oh man I have a lot of homework this weekend. I really have to finish it all tomorrow so I can go home and see judd. I can't wait to see him tomorrow. I wish he could be up here experiencing all this with me. I can't wait for him to come to school up here and be with me! that will totally complete me here. I don't know if I'm complete without him. I've never felt dependent on someone like that before. well I think my time is almost up. in conclusion, I feel so amazed that I'm actually here. I miss my friends who aren't here, and I especially miss judd. I want to work hard here and prove myself to everyone and make really good grades and fully experience everything ut has to offer. ",1
"It is 12:51 and I would really like to go to sleep right now. I think I would feel better if I could just take my eyes out of my head. It's cold in here. My finger itches and I don't know why. It won't stop and its affecting my writing. I hope I used the right form of ?affect? in that last sentence. I hope I don't have any spelling errors either. I have so many things to study and I'm trying to figure out when I can do it all. There's a really cool show on the TV that's on about mummies. It's very interesting. I think I missed Tom and Jerry on the Cartoon Network today. My finger stopped itching. Now my arm itches (and I'm not making this up just to copy the example in class), it really does itch. I need to pay some bills later. I just want to go to sleep right now. I hope I will go to sleep tonight because I couldn't last night. My arm stopped itching. I don't know what else to write and I've still got 10 minutes left. Boy, this is taking a long time. Now the TV is on some stupid show and I would change it but I have to keep typing. I think I'll take a nap after this so I don't fall asleep in class. That Philly Cheesesteak I had for lunch was really good. I'll need to drink so more water before I go back out in the heat or I'll collapse. This humidity kills me. Walking around campus is very good exercise though. I need to remember to take my calculator to math Friday. Well, that's almost 5 more minutes. I mean, it's not a bad writing assignment, its just feels so monotonous. I had to pop my fingers a second. I probably should call my cousin who lives in Austin, but I really don't want her to be over here all the time least she find out where I live. That reminds me, I need to go switch my meal card later and check my voice mail. 2 minutes to go. I hope you don't think I'm crazy by reading this but you probably do so, oh well. 1 more minute. 1 more minute ten I can take a nap. Almost there. 15 seconds. THE END ",1
"What to write. I just missed dinner because I came down here to write this paper. I think that they should make dinner last longer then just till 7:00 at night. That sucks. Last night I requested that they give us a new couch because the one we have now hurts my back. Besides I saw what the new couches looked like and they are pretty cool. They are bright blue, not just plan gray. Grey is so boring. I wonder what I will do tonight. I could stay home and do my homework and sleep,  maybe get to see what a good night's sleep feels like. But I will most likely go out and party like I always get suckered into. So the guy situation on campus. Not to bad. The one Im dating now is a sweetie. But now that Im dating him it is not as fun anymore. Why is that?  The fun part is the challenge of getting the guy but now that I have him I don't want to spend any time with him. I am such a bitch. God, my eyes can't handle looking at a computer screen too long. They get all dried out. We have a Nintendo at our room upstairs, and I sit there for hours and my eyes kill me. Well, not really for hours, just a little exaggeration. My roommates are pretty cool. I like them a lot. Sometimes I feel bad because I don't spend as much time with them as they do together so now they are closer to each other and I kinda feel left out. But I spent my time with my other friends. My best friend Athena who is just down the hall and whom I love so very much. I am so glad that she is here. I would hate it here if she weren't. When I fist got here I was kinda upset that she was on my floor because I wanted my space and my time away from her, but now I love it. It is a perfect set up. I can go and visit her anytime I want and she can come to my room if she likes but I don't feel like hanging with her than I don't have to. How come I can write forever and this screen just keeps scooting over, it makes my feel like Im not writing that much. Last time I did this I only wrote one line. And the sad thing was I was sitting at the computer for about an hour. I just had people distracting me. I wonder how you check your e-mail. I wonder if Chris wrote me. Chris is such a great guy. I hope he comes down and visits sometime soon. I miss the boy. He is the one guy I regret not ever liking. I had my chance with him and broke his heart, but I guess that's the way life goes. I always go for the loser guys who treat me like shit. Maybe that's why I never like a guy after I finally know he likes me, he is too nice and treats me too well. Doesn't that suck. I thought that the psy. experiment in class was very entertaining. I hope that I do well in this class it is truly an interesting subject. But is seems like I won't be doing well in any of my classes. I don't concentrate enough. I came down here thinking that I was going to get a 4. 0, or at least close to that. But now my study habits have gotten so bad that I don't know what is going to happen to my. I think that I will change my ways and get back on track. I started out exercising every day too, but now I haven't ran in several days. The freshman 15 here I come. Ok that has been 20 min. Hope you had fun analyzing me! ",1
"Well, I'm 18 years old now and I'm in college. So far it has been kind of boring really and I still have not received my math book so that kind of ruins everything. Ok not everything but it's not a good thing and wow 20 minutes is a long time. I want to watch this show on television but  I guess I won't so let's see what else I am thinking. The dryer is kind of loud and only 2 minutes have passed since I've been typing nonsense. School is also exhausting. I take naps like everyday and you know I actually like writing about nothing because why?  Hmm. Well, because I'm not stuck with a certain topic and I just have to decide what to write about. I would talk about smell but there is nothing exquisite in the air right now if that makes any sense. However, about 1 hour ago I was eating meatloaf that my brother made and it was pretty good but now I'm hungry again because I didn't have much to eat. So I'm thinking of going to Starbucks and getting some delicious Mocha Frappucino. Is that spelt with 1 or 2 ""c's"". Anyways before I go to Starbucks I may go to the weight room hopefully not the one at UT because I may still have other assignments to attend to and UT is too far of a distance. Man I wonder what time Starbucks is closed. I also want some ice cream. I sure hope that I don't gain the Freshman 15 because that would really suck. I hope that doesn't offend whomever has to read this because I didn't mean to. I sure hope that I learn to manage my time later on or sooner actually. My throat or something hurts and I wish that I could just sleep all day. I hate some of my classes and I hate being in the Gateway Program. It's alright but not what I expected. I definitely didn't expect to take a class for that program but I am stuck in the most boring of boring classrooms. I feel like what am I doing there and can I get out of the program without hurting the Coordinator?  Also, when should I try to get out of the program?  6 more minutes to go. what to talk about? what to talk about?  Oh yeah, I had a fever last week and I hope that I don't get sick again this year. Another thing about the Gateway program is that I have to go to some social events and that takes time out of my life. I definitely don't know what to do. They like helped me register or whatever and I have to wait 3 hours and 30 minutes on MWF before my last class on those days which is Psychology and I have no idea what to do during that time and I tend to feel drowsy or sleepy during that class. Sorry. 2 more minutes. I'm looking at this sheet and I have no idea what to do with my UT email address and how to get into it. Does that make me dumb?  I wonder if I'm even going to get a response for that question. yeah 9 more seconds.  ",1
"I thought I would because I've visited with my friends so many times before, but now that I'm actually here it's finally true. I'm away from my parents, it's so great. I live with three great girls in my suite and we're so popular here. I've always been a socially outgoing person, but now I feel like it's going to work. there are always large numbers of people in our living room, bringing in food or beer to contribute to our refrigerator; everyone munches from it. and it's OK. the RA told us about this girl in another room who got so upset because her roommate ate her store bought cookies without asking; she called her mom and was so upset. I'm so glad its not like that here. we all contribute and all consume. But it's not like there's always noise and party's here. only when we all decide. if one person wants to read or study or sleep, we're really considerate. I hope that lasts, I'm pretty sure it will. At our building there are many foreign exchange students which is always a plus because, come on, who minds a foreign accent every once in a while. this guy from Belgium and this one from England are always watching TV in our room, which is another amusing thing: we don't have cable, or an antenna, or a VCR, so we only get FOX Channel 7. We sit around and watch whatever's on. in one way it's good because we don't have arguments over which channel to watch. maybe simplicity is  the root of compromise. We had a floor meeting the other night here and they discussed some issues that had come up. it was so funny because almost all of them referred to our room's shananagans. This one guy came here from where he lives in a house to use the laundry (he's one of our friends- our referring to my roommate and I we've been friends since 2nd grad, long time, huh? ) anyway, he dropped like half a box of laundry detergent on the stairwell and no one noticed for a week. the RA got mad and cleaned it up herself, but it was amusing because he doesn't even live here. another thing was the ""stolen furniture"" incident. we are given this loveseat-type couch in our suite's living room that can maybe seat 3 people if you're lucky. and in the lobby of the 3rd floor in front of the elevator there are 2 large couches that just block the pathway, no one ever sits in them, and they could probably seat 5 or 6. so when no one was around, my suitemate and I and 3 other people that happened to b in our room at the time helped us move our dinky little couch into the lobby which is down the hall and around a corner. we hauled the large couch down the way and we had to tilt it sideways and temporarily knock off some of the ceiling tiles just to make it in the doorway without banging down the door across from us. now we have a nice couch that is well used and the RA's are threatening to do a room check to find it. why?  its going to more use. It's all kind of a double standard anyway. The head RA is always in our room hanging out and drinking our beer. he has a crush on me so he always brings us stuff and won't mention the couch to the others and lets us into the cafeteria at night. it's pretty funny, one night the night guard knocked on our door because someone had made a noise complaint. we opened the door and the guard stood in the threshold and the head RA stood behind the door quietly while we got reprimanded. it probably wouldn't have been in his best interests to b seen in there. He's only 20, but the building is changing management, so right now he's the head guy. its odd. I'm 18. finally. I could be in a management position at the pool I lifeguard at in the summers, next summer. it seems odd that I'm really an adult. when you're a kid u never think that you're ever going to get to the point where you decide when to come home and when to do this and what to do in this situation, type thing. its like the transition from high school to college really is that much of a change in that you're independent. it feels so good to finally b independent, financially, physically, emotionally. its wonderful responsibility. I am responsible for watching my budget, if I don't, no one will bail me out (well that's probably not true but you know). I guess I'm trying out freedom on borrowed wings, I can always have that security blanket if I want, but I don't want. I want to be independent. I am right now, I hope to stay that way ",1
"Ok, it is 2:02 in the morning and I don't even know why I am doing this assignment --- I just spend over an hour doing the experiment pretesting and I should have gone to bed before I even started doing that, considering the faxct that it is not due for a while. but, I guess it is good that I did it now cause I tend to procrastinate and I probably would have ended up on the due day trying to get connected to the sight and have 40 million other people trying the same thing --- connecting to these sights are so ridiculous - it was impossible to get through the ut main sight to register for classes -- I'm spelling sight the wrong way, I think - spelling is one of my worst subjects, derek always makes fun of me for the way I spell and how I am the only graduate of high school who can't spell the simplest words (for example, that one!)  he also laughs cause I always say periferial vision the wrong way --- he's so smart, he makes me sick, I don't know what I would do if I were that smart - I guess that I could do anything that I wanted to, and I guess he sort of does too, he went to school last year and partied all the time and still got higher than a 3. 5 - that's what I got in high school, and I admit that I didn't study, but I also didn't go out every night - I guess I just procrastinated and pretended like I had more to do than I really did, but then all of the work piled up and I really did end up to have lots to do, but I also let the work pile up because I was talking to derek on the phone ---- my parents almost killed me because of the phone bill, and made me pay for it - and it was so expensive! my phone bill is already going to be skyrocketting and I have only been here for a week and a half, but most of it is to my parents, so that will be acceptable to them cause they were the ones who wanted to find out what rush was and how it went and they wanted every single detail, so I guess I can't really get in trouble!  ok, it is 2:09 and I don't have anything to write about already - I guess I have a short attention span casue this was fun at first and now I would rather go and call derek and talk to him on the phone, or check my email or something - I am so proud that I am actually trying to do my work ahead of time, then again this is the fun homework and I always get the fun stuff done first and then have all of the bad and boring stuff left till the end - if I type fast, which I think I do, I am going to have ended up typing a lot more stuff in 20 minutes than other people would have, and that's not really fair, but that's ok, cause I talk a lot and am sure that I will find stuff to talk about even if it is not in any kind of readable and understandable form ---- I don't like puncuation - I just like dashes like a thought afterwards or something, though that is normally what it is, I also don't like to capitalize a lot if I am writing something really fast and not stopping, so that is why this is not capitalized and has lots of hyphens, they are just more fun --- I wonder who was the first person who evewr thought to make little faces out of the symbols on the keyboard, I mnean, who sits down at his/her computer and looks at all of the punctuation keys, ect. and thinks, oh that would make a smiley face, ect?  the icq smiley faces are better than the ones on aol cause they automatically turn into the stereotypical yellow smiley face instead of the actual punctuation marks - derek bought boxers with me that were joe boxer once, and that was kind of embarrasing cause there was an old lady right there and I didn't want her to think that we were doing inappropriate things and that I was just used to seeing his boxers all of the time, so I pretended I was his sister, though that's what I feel like anyway - we have known eachother for so long, told eachother so many things, and done so much with each other that we are just like brother and sister - I don't know what I am going to do next year, I guess I can just I'm him, but that's never as good as talking on the phone and the international calls would get me killed, but I can't stand the thought of not hearing his voice and all of the different inflections therein!  how sad! I guess I won't think of that for now, but that's just going to make it worse next year, but then again, maybe we will have gotten in some huge fight and not be talking by then, which would of course e bad, but on the other hand, it could be good cause then I would not be wishing that I was talking to him - ok, I forgot what time I started writing this and it is 2:18 I think it was 2:05 - oh no I think it was 2:02 --- I am going to cheat and stop to look at what time it is for the sake of my poor hands that are getting ready to fall off - I need to get back into the habit of typing, though it was so hard for me not to be typing in classes today and yesterday - I have no hope of keeping up while I am taking notes by hand, I am just not used to it - there was one guy in my chem class taking notes on his laptop, so maybe I'll bring mine next time so that I will actually leave with good notes, but chem is the worst class to bring the laptop to cause there are lots of charts and drrawings ect. that take me too long to do on the laptop that I would have to do on paper, leave space on the word processor, print it out and then copy the picture back to the other sheet, but I don't htink I would do that, or I guess that I would wnat to - iam getting sleepy and want to go to sleep - my roommate goes to bed too early and has classes too early and I feel badly keeping her up, but she said that she was a night person and I todl her that I definitely was, and I guess she'll have to get used to it, but I still feel badly --- it is now 2:22 and I forgot to look and see waht time I started so I guess I willl look now and if it was at 2:02 I will not write any more and if it was at :05 then I will have 3 minutes left to write - is that right? I am so bad at mental math - derek is so good at it, he makes me sick - I can't do anything in my head and he can do more in his head than I can with the calculator, but that's ok I can do things that he can't so I guess we have to even out sometime - I guess that I will check the time now.

"     The green leaves outside are a very vibrant color of green today. I really hope it doesn't rain again today because I got really wet yesterday. That ticking closk is really annoying me. I never really notice it until I I have to go to work though. Theres my sisters Harry Potter book. I wonder if the next movie that comes out will be any good. I really hope it is. I have no idea why my Dad is so into trains right now, hes been collecting them everywhere. I think this is his midlife crisis hobby. We had to drive four hours this summer to go to a little dinky town called Rusk just to ride a steam train. It wasn't really worth it. I wanted the train to go under a tunnel or something but it never did. That French toast i made this morning really wasn't very good. I left a funny taste in my mouth. I should probably go brush my teeth, they have syrup all over them. I am so tired I shouldn't have stayed up as late as i did last night. Putting my thoughts on paper is really hard. I have no idea what to write.  My arm hurts. I think its because i haven't streched it since volleyball season last year. I hope the team does well this year. I'm pretty confident they will. They have some really good players this year. i wonder how good of a player Mr. Pace's daughter really is. she made varsiity this year as a freshmen but then again thats really not too hard to do, considering. The new coach seems to be aa good coach though. I really hope she's able to build up a strong team. I wish that I could play for one more year. volleyball is so much fun. I wonder if i could get a team together to play intramural volleyball. That would be a whole lot of fun. Dawn alread y said she didn't want to do it. She is so unmotivated sometimes. I think we need one of those wrist pads for our computer. My hand is getting tired. Its probably just because I haven't typed hardly anything for the entire summer. I really want to take a typing class somewhere so I would learn how to type a lot faster. That would make papers a lot easier to write.   ",1
"I'm mad because I had just typed for twenty minutes and now I have to do it all over again because something happened to my laptop. AHHHHHH, I'm mad. Anyways today I turned 18. I'm so happy. Now I'm just going to write about anything because I'm hungry and tired. Today was a good day until this stupid thing happened. I'm mad. Tomorrow I'm going to San Antonio and I hope me three friends from Dallas can come visit me. It'll be all of them, Johnny, Cleo, my mom, and my two sisters. Lauren's letter made me cry. It was about how proud she is of me and all that good stuff. It was sweet too. Jesse made me cry yesterday because he got me something for my birthday and I thought he hated me since I'm with Johnny and all. That was sweet of him, but I wouldn't consider going back with him because of all the bullshit he put me through. He used to hurt me more emotionally than physically, but he did both at times. My other writing assignment was all nice and this one is all about bad things. Anyways, being 18 will be cool. I finally get to go into the club legally, meaning without a fake id. I also get to get my own bank account, either Wells Fargo or the University Federal Credit Union. I also get to go get my driver's license, because I never went to driver's education. Yeah! Okay, I'm a little happy now. Johnny is a good boyfriend though. He really cares about me and puts me first on what he should put me before. Like he rather be with me than his friends. That's cool sometimes, but I saw him this summer just enough to know that he really likes me. He hasn't called me yet. Oh oh I'm sad again. I miss him, and I'm glad I get to see him and all my friends tomorrow, hopefully my friends. I still have homework or should I say dormwork to do. HAHAHAHA! Okay that was corny, but I'm still cool. Oh yeah I'm going to a party at around 9:30. Oh oh I guess I'll have to call Johnny by then if he doesn't call me. He said he was going to the mall, so maybe that's where he's at. I know he had practice today so he got out at 5, but he still hasn't called me. Well it's still light outside, so I guess that's okay. Two more minutes and I hope the my laptop doesn't mess up again. Well today was a great day and I feel like Doey Howser typing away at my computer. That was dumb but I'm mad so I guess that's okay. Well times up, bye. ",1
"It is late, and I know I should have started this earlier tonight, but I procrastinate. I wonder if the perfect guy for me is out there somewhere and thinking about me right now and I do not even know. I just put to rest my last relationship. Too bad I messed things up with a great guy for a guy who treats me badly even though I love the guy who treats me badly. I hate that he is in my head every day, every minute. I tell people I have put him out of my life, but is he really? Every time I say that he comes back into my life and I love him even more than I did the time before. I hope that God is up there on his thrown writing down in my life book that I will meet my perfect mate tomorrow and when I do I will just know that he is the one for me. I would get married at a young age if it was the right guy and he asked me to marry him. I hate when my stepmother tells me I should wait until I have lived alone for a few years before I get married. Just because that is what she did does not mean that it is what I should do. Every person is different and I should follow my heart. I'm quite scared though because my mom did not have good luck with finding a wonderful man to share her life with. I mean, my dad cheated on her and my stepfather beat her. I hope it is not genetic. I don't know if I am willing to stand out in the heat tomorrow and Thursday to draw for football tickets. I want to see the OU game, but I really want to see it from the comforts of my home. Plus, I do not have a date and everyone else will and I will feel out of place. My roommate is with her boyfriend. I am jealous of her because she has a great boyfriend and I want one too. I spotted this goodlooking guy in my philosophy discussion group and I would like to get to know him more. I have emailed him though and he hasn't emailed me back. I think that I saw him tonight while I was walking down the street, but I did not want to stare, so I could not get a very good look. I am looking forward to getting married and waking up in the same arms every morning. I even have everything for my perfect wedding planned out. I want to get married on the same day my grandparents did and I want to have a big orchestra playing my favorite slow songs. I wish that I would be walking down the aisle to Ryan, but he does not want me. If he did I would be the happiest girl in the world. He makes me feel like a princess when I am with him and he is treating me right. I only wish that one day he will open his eyes and realize what he gave up because he said he wanted to be ""free"". I guess I did mess things up with him though because I lied to another guy. I was just so confused this summer and I did not know what I wanted if I could not have Ryan. He would be my first choice over any guy in the world and it should not be like that because he hurts me so many times too. I just loved being with him. I wondered if my grandparents knew that they would be together for so long when they were married fiftyseven years ago. I think that is so special and I would thank God every day if I had that same thing happen to me. I am thirsty, but I am too lazy to get up right now. I hope that I can get my two friends together soon. It is weird that the guy that is like my brother now is the first boy I ever kissed. It was so long ago though. Who would have thought that he and I would be so close now that it would be like we were brother and sister? ",1

"Ever since this assignment was introduced in class, I've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). It's just that when I sit down at the computer to type something, I usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. Never have I just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. I guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because I find it so hard to express myself at times. The other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, ""That's you!"" I guess I had never really thought about that label applying to me. But once you started listing examples, I had an epiphany. I guess I am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. I like everything neat, clean, and orderly. I can't stand having a dirty living space. I mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? For me, it's just not possible. Plus, I think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. I like to make good first impressions and the way I maintain my room is a way of achieving that. I think I get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. I remember one time I started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because I wasn't washing the dishes ""the right way. "" Of course I can't really complain because I do a lot of that too. I understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but I just like to do things my way because I see the logic in it. A lot of my friends think I'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if I wasn't, I can't even imagine what my life would be like. Being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. It is something that will never change. I guess I shouldn't say that because every time I say I will never do something, I end up doing it later on. For example, when I was younger, I told my older sister I would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. So I guess that's why I should never say never. I have so much to do today. I probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. Of course I had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing Jeopardy online with my boyfriend. I've always loved playing intellectual games. It makes me feel great when I can answer a question or figure out a word on a puzzle because people are really smarter than they think. Sometimes you think you don't remember anything from a class you took sophomore or junior year in high school, but then it pops up in a Jeopardy question and you know the answer to it. It amazes me the things I remember from some of my classes in high school. And sometimes, that information came from classes that I thought were totally useless at that time. Now, I realize that there's no such thing as useless information (except for maybe Calculus when you're studying to be a Communications major). ",1
"     As soon as I am done with this I plan to go over to my friends, maybe to the gym. I don't really feel much like working. My biggest concern for this semester will be motivation my self to do the requried work. My telephone just rang. My air conditioner seems louder than all of the other ones that I have heard. Right now I am rather thirsty, having just walked the campus with my uncle and cousin. We ate at Wendy's and the food was salty. I wish I was in a cold swimming pool right now. This weekend was fun. We went swimming in the lake. College is kind of wierd not having my family around all of the time. I dont' miss them terribly, but I just feel strange without having them around to talk to for a few seconds of joke with. Classes have not been that hard these first several days, and I am wondering if they will pick up greatly as far as difficulty is concerned. Now I seem to have nothing on my mind. I am just staring at the computer screen. All I really need to do tonight is work on a few calculus problems. My neck is still a little sore. I will take some aspirin later. I will check my mailbox later today. My bare feet are getting cold on the tile floor. Now I am not really thinking of much. I feel like resting on my bed for about ten minutes before I head out of my room. In fact, right when I am finished writing this I am going to lay on my bed. I am ready to get into the full swing of college classes. Only about 90 days until Christmas break. ",1
"Moving here to Austin has had me thinking about all sorts of things, about my life in general. These past few weeks, I have been analyzing about every aspect of my life. I am constantly running countless memories of my life by home through my mind. As excited as I am to be here, and I much as I dislike the city I moved from, I cannot help but miss my friends and family and all that I left behind. I am not the most outgoing of people and I find it difficult to strike up conversations with random people, therefore prolonging any new friendships. I love this city, though and I am trying to come out of my shell and be the fun loving, loud girl I was back home. My friends and family back home reassure me it will only be a matter of time before I begin to feel right at home and have a whole new hoard of friends, but until then, I feel very lonely. My roommates on the other hand are worse off than me. The three of them are all friends of mine from back home. They all have boyfriends with who they are in constant contact with. They are eternally homesick and pretty much no fun whatsoever. I am a person who finds it difficult to hang around the house all day, but they on the other hand do not even want to go out to explore the city. So they are a big drag in my social life. Hopefully by the end of the year, I will have gotten them to enjoy party life at least half as much as I do, that is if I can tear them away from their cell phones for more than five minutes. All this time at home has allowed me to build up a nice collection of songs from the internet, and enjoy all the benefits the internet has to offer. I have been able to chat with friends near and far in length without any phone charges, which is always nice. Yes I am very happy to be here in Austin, but I just want this transitional phase to fly by so I can feel right at home. I am not even so much homesick as I am just lonely. With my circle of friends limited I do not have much to do except things on my own. Perhaps that is not such a bad thing, seeing as how I am doing some definite soul searching on my long lonely walks and my hours spent at bookstores, and libraries. ",1
"I am going home for the weekend, and I'm wondering what it will be like after being gone for two weeks. I miss home, my friends, my family, everything about corpus christi. I mean, I'm not sad or anything, but I really cannot wait to get there. I'm thinking of how the bus ride will be on the way home, how it is kind of inefficient to take greyhound because of the schedules and long time that it takes to make a relatively short trip. basically, my mind is not thinking about one specific thing. rather, many thoughts are coming to me during the days here at UT. memories of high school, things I did, things I said, just normal context between me and my friends. after not making longhorn band, I often find myself reflecting on band in high school, the band that we all seemed to always be complaining about, but the band that now seems so great to be a part of. I think about being in it, taking solos in jazz band, and that seems to be where I want to be right now, most of the days, that's where I'd like to be. I think about the solos I took on various songs, the ideas I came up with, and the ones I'm coming up with now; I wish I could be in it to play them, I whistle and hum the different rhythms that I would play, my friend and I try to remember all of the songs that we played last year, and the various experiences that came along with performing. I also am thinking about my family and friends, how I miss them, and how I'm going to them this weekend. I think of how I want to be in corpus, and how to make the weekend last as long as possible. I'm trying to think of what to do there, and whether or not I will get to go to laredo to see the football game for my high school. hopefully so. besides that, I think about my sister in Houston, how she's coming to austin this weekend, and how I'm going to corpus this weekend. but I know that we'll see each other soon. I think about my room at home. the food I'm used to eating in corpus, how I really want to eat there because I'm tired of this dorm food. I try to remember as much about home as I can, but there always seems to be more that I think of later. so much complexity about home; however, when I was there before moving up here, sometimes things seemed to boring, but not now. corpus seems like home, because it is. I just can't wait to be there, and I can't wait to go again, hopefully in two weeks. I also think about my classes here, how I'm wondering how I'm going to do in them, if I'm studying enough or writing down the right things in my notes. I hope that I will do good on my first tests, and I hope that the semester is not too hard as long as I study and keep up with everything. I think of my classes at high school, whether I was that smart or not, I wonder if I'm smart enough to be an engineer, I hope that I do not feel inadequate about myself or start feeling like I'm stupid or something. I think all of these thoughts right now, and like I said, they pop in and out of my mind, with no constant or predictable duration or timing. it almost seems like I'm thinking about everything at the same time, and I guess, various specific thoughts become highlighted or standout every now and then, but while I think about everything I can concentrate on one thing while also thinking about everything else too. other than that, my thoughts are pretty much summed up in this paragraph.

"I'm pretty happy with my first week and a half of classes. I've met a lot of people. It means a lot to me. I am a very quiet, sort of shy person. I was afraid of coming to UT because I'm not the best at making friends. So far though, it hasn't been a problem. My big classes have been a little intimidating because of there size. I used to have classes about 30 or less. Right now I am happy, UT won its first football game. I'm glad I was able to go. It was lots of fun. Now I feel a little exhausted. I haven't really done all that much today. I actually got to sleep for 12 hours last night. I could be exhausted because I am hungry. I think I'm pretty lucky. My parents sent me some food. My brother brought it to Austin. He and I will share it. I'm already starting to miss home-cooked meals. I think my 20 minutes are just about up. I probably fix a bite to eat, watch a little T. V. and go to sleep. ",1
"I can't believe I'm doing this assignment should be asleep right now I wish that my roommate would quit playing his music. My other roommate is a dork he's always talking about god and crap and telling me that I shouldn't drink and this and that fuck him he's no better than me he's just as bad in other ways I really hate it when all his friends come over here it's like fucking chinatown that's what my whole dorm is like just a bunch of asians and arabs except for the 22nd floor all the people on that floor seem to be white and that's where all the hot girls are I need to get on that floor I should have just lived in towers that would have been better. speaking of hot girls I wonder what stephanie is doing right now. I really should call her and try and hook up with her I can't tell if she is putting me off or if shit really keeps coming up that she has to do instead of going out with me but oh well that girl susan is really nice and she seems genuinely interested but it's hard to tell but she does have really nice tits why did I just write that whoever is grading this is going to think that I am just a perverted moron but that's not true I don't know why people think that about me but it really pisses me off in fact nothing pisses me off more than when people think I am stupid, especially when I am smarter than that person that really sucks that vinny testaverde is out for the season the jets are going to suck this year and I can't believe that the cowboys won today that was just unbelievable. I wonder if my pledge brothers were watching the game I really hate my pledge brother Nayel that guy seems so shady if he's not acting like a greedy little son of a bitch he's acting like a fucking tool that should be Nayel's new nickname, tool. oh well its been 20 minutes and I am tired of doing this so no more words goodbye.

"Adjusting to the classes, increased freedom and increases in ""having a good time"" have all been fairly easy to get used to. Meeting new people has been exciting and the ""name game of trying"" to remember everyone I have met has been a challenge. This Labor Day weekend I saw the huge different between high school and college as I decided to take a road trip with three other friends to Galveston, a popular Labor Day hangout. I don't know if it was the college parties that made  the night we were there seem dull or just that several key things were missing that usually made the time memorable. Seeing my younger friends made me feel out of place, and talk of curfew violations almost made me laugh. One thing is for sure those times are over and  getting further away, but also new and improved times are ahead. This weekend has also showed me that I am a very patient person. My roommate Paul has shown this to me. Having my windshield broken, being almost evicted from our apartment and being irresponsible are just a few of my things my roommate has done this weekend. If I am still sane at the end of the year I think that I will be a stronger person, because of having to deal with Paul. I feel the classes are picking up as professors start talking about future exams. O, I almost forgot to mention my goals for this year (in no specific order)- get good grades (a 4. 0), not get fatter, stupider, not get into too much trouble and have a blast. Basically I hope to work hard and play hard. ",1
"Well after Labor Day weekend I had come to the conclusion that I disliked the college life. Everything had gone so wrong that weekend. The book store sent me home with the wrong book, I didn't have my ""IF"" account so I couldn't check my email, and I bought a twenty dollar calling card that is supposed to be better than the one I had been buying and it was a rip off. The tendollar card had more minutes on it than than the twentydollar card, and to top that off the darn thing only had sixteen dollars on it. So my weekend was just a bunch of carp. I am not exactly home sick, but I do miss my baby brother and my fiancé. I went home this past weekend, missed the first football game here, and saw the two people I missed most. It was so cool to be home everybody was so happy to see me, it was great. I am planning on joining a sorority here to keep me busy so I won't get home sick. I haven't really met anyone here yet. The girls on my floor aren't very friendly. When I first got here I was bored out of my mind, but now things are looking better. I am not real in to Sixth Street, but the first week I was here some friends that live here took me there. I got my tattoo on Sixth Street when we were here for orientation. I keep saying we, my best friend and I that is. My best friend is my roommate and she is trying to get me to enjoy it here and not miss home too much. I have to say I do like the fact that my parents can't tell me what to do, and when to be home and all the other things that parents tell their kids to do. I was ready to get away and be on my own. My fiancé is at home going to school there. Hopefully he will come up here next year. We are supposed to get married this summer, but I guess we will have to see what happens. It is so weird to see everyone outside smoking in the middle of the night, and to see people going out at three in the morning. At home we have a curfew, and they are real strict about it too. Other than all that stuff, I am adjusting pretty well to the college life and am learning to love it. Things can only get better, right. I know I made it sound like I just hate it here, but I don't. The weekend at home was enough to hold me off for awhile. That one bad weekend made me think that it was always going to be like that. Next time I will be writing about how much I love it here, and I won' t have anything to complain about. ",1
"Okay here I am after I've been spending tons of time trying to get a book I need. I'm not worried about it anymore. I will focus on my other homework. I need to go to the lounge and get organized before lunch. Maybe I won't eat lunch. Tonight I have a party to go to and I am excited. I need to tell my friend what time we will leave. Where will I park? Maybe we should walk, but it will be late when we come home and very unsafe. The radio is on and I'm listening to country music. It's so great and calming. comforting--reminds me of home. I am going home tomorrow. I can't wait to see my two dogs and possibly go swimming in the pool. I will also help my mom get the new restaurant organized. Sleep is a priority as well. Oh, and I'll see my friends and be able to talk locally on the phone for a change. Wow, I forgot about the chance that I will get a home cooked meal. I need to get some more clothes from home and do my huge load of laundry. I'll come home Monday evening. I need to wash my car while I'm there. I hope my roommate is occupied enough while I'm gone. She can come home with me another time. I hear people in the hall all the time. It's amazing how many are up as early as I for an 8 am class. No one talks, it's like a march to a funeral or something. without the tears and gloom, just the silence. My eyes burn because I'm so tired. I took an hour nap yesterday, but I don't have time today. I can't get my Ethernet hooked up right and it really makes me mad--I'm VERY frustrated. very chapped! I am getting uneasy now; sitting here typing this is making me realize all of the things I  need to do. I know though that I can get it done, just one thing at a time. Plus, I am doing one of those things right now. I wonder how many people here are close enough to home to go visit. I'm an hour away, not bad. I hear this song ""looking for love in all the wrong places"" and it reminds me of Eddie Murphy on the old Saturday Night Live. He did Buckwheat impersonations. I have an ache in my neck either from lack of sleep or carrying heavy books. I hope this doesn't sound like a letter. I am beginning every sentence with ""I"" but that's okay because I am supposed to notice how ""my"" thoughts flow. I wonder who ever got this computer stuff--internet, websites, etc. --started in the very, very beginning. Hmm, well, it doesn't matter that much to me. I just wish I could get my Ethernet hooked up. I like America Online, but it's tying up my phone line. That is also making my anxious right now. I guess the faster you type the longer the paper. I wonder what the other students doing this have to say. I wonder who will take their classes seriously and not. I hope I get some mail soon. I check it everyday and it's sort of depressing. I know people are writing/sending mail, but it just isn't here yet. That's my optimistic side. I hate the cold floor under my desk. I'm in jester, but I have carpet that I brought to go between the beds. I'm thinking of my friend in Alaska that will come at Christmas time. Will we have time for me to show the good stuff about Texas? My throat tightens to think of it. I stress easily. I feel a pressure to make his time here the best and to make him leave here thinking that Texas is the coolest place to be. It won't be as pretty in December though. Great, I have about 5 more minutes. My hands are slipping off this  tiny space. I have no room on my desk. I want to get a huge piece of plywood and cover it with contact paper and make a huge desk--like the people down the hall. It would be so ideal. I am getting really anxious to go to the study lounge. I feel like I'll lose the urge to do my math homework if I sit here any longer. Oh, I can't wait until the party. Matchbox 20 ( my favorite group) is going to be there!!!!! I need to remember to take my camera. I also need to iron my shorts and pick out a shirt to wear. All of this by 4 PM--I believe that's when we'll go to the sorority house and hang out a bit, then get our wristbands and head over the block party. Well, my leg is falling asleep and my eyes are really getting tired now. I wish I could go to sleep. I hate it when I can't focus because I'm so tired. I value sleep more than money it seems. If that makes any sense. I am ready to go now, I feel the pressure of having too many things to do. I will take care of my math homework first. Then biology and art history. Psychology is halfway done now, but I need to get the book. no one has it. That is also causing a little aggravation. I hate to not be fully prepared for everything. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, I feel better having done this. ",1

"In the past I have always had a set of instructions to follow. On well, here goes. I guess that right now I was back, at the beginning of summer, sitting in my room in El Paso, Texas. This summer was really good. I got to go home and talk with my friends. In addition, I was able to do work and get my history requirement fulfilled. Everyone wants me to go out and get a job. That's okay with me, but I don't really know how to go about getting a good job. You see, I feel that with almost 60 hrs of credit, I should be able to get a decent job. One guy I know is making over 50,000, and he isn't even out of college. I guess it's just easier for some people and not for others. I promised everyone that I would get an internship with a company next summer. That's kind of cool, but it is going to be a completely new experience. I guess I could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if I could get a job with them, but that just wouldn't be good. I want to be able to say, ""here is what I did, and I did it all by myself. "" I know that it's natural to want to get out from under your parent's wing, but it just seems to me that it takes forever. I have been blessed, though. I have done well in school, and fortunately I have a comfortable place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. Sometimes it bothers me that I am more preoccupied with which movie I am going to go see this weekend than with more substantive subjects. There are people in this earth who can't even find enough to eat. wow, this is really getting deep. I don't want this to become a ""dear Abby"" kind of assignment, so I guess the best thing to do is to change the subject. I am mildly interested in why this assignment was assigned. I have a certain hesitation when I deal with psychologists and people who are interested in psychology because I always feel like everything I do or say is being evaluated, and that bothers me. Well, I can hear my neighbors (they just turned up their stereo system. )Back to the subject at hand. I am not nearly so stressed this semester like I was last year. I guess that's pretty cool because I am adjusting to the whole college thing pretty well. At least now I know what is going on with this school, this city, and everything else in my life. I by no means have everything figured out, but at least I am not as clueless as I was last year. It is interesting to look around and see the freshman, with the look of panic in their eyes and realize that I was in the exact same predicament a year ago. Since the brother of a friend of mine just moved to Austin and started attending graduate school in engineering, I feel a certain obligation to help him. It is awful to be in the exact same situation without anyone to help. Anyway, the guy is really cool, and I think that a really good friendship will develop. Friendship is something that there is never enough of. Money can't buy good friends, and even though people will try to replace friends with artificial benefits, it just never works. I used to know a man who had loads of money. This guy was really wealthy, but he was never happy. However, if you ever asked him how he was doing, he would never admit that he was unhappy. I guess that is really sad. To be miserable is one thing, but to be miserable and not really know it is something completely different. I think that it is possible to elevate your situation if you are miserable, but I also believe that it constitutes knowing that you are miserable. Rrahhh, my neighbors just turned down their stereo system. Thank God for the little things! I don't really understand why people are always claiming they are depressed. I've been through periods when I feel down, but all I ever do is call my friends, turn on the television to a program I like, go work out, or a host of other things to elevate that situation. I don't believe that 10% of Americans need to be on Prozac, or some other drug which makes you feel better. Oh, well. I guess the only thing that I can do is change my own destiny. Even though it scares me, it is kind of cool. I see so many people who are in a rut, and it makes me feel like their lives are hopeless. I know that changing is hard. I don't really like to change. However, it always seems that when I do, it is for the better. Of course, there are those times when you change, and it proves to be a change for the worse. That only goes to reinforce your opinion that changing is wrong and you shouldn't do it. I believe that a person should experience all the things life has to offer at least once. That way they can say that they've done it. In addition, they'll know what it is. You know, I always feel awkward when I am in a conversation that turns stale. (I. e. the kind of conversation where no one really knows what to say. ) That really is bad. It seems like I have been in too many of those type of situations. I don't really know what the future has in store for me, but I am both excited and apprehensive. It is easy to look back on my past and think that those days were the glory days when everything was easy. Unfortunately, those days proved to be no different than today. Is that the way it always is? Your memory improves memories as time goes on? If so, I can understand how the past was so alluring and appealing to many people. I know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is. That's pretty sad. I think that they need to start living today for what it is worth. That's what I try to do. I guess my 20 minutes are up. This was kind of an interesting experiment, but I am not entirely sure what the results are. I don't really know myself, and I don't know if it is possible to know yourself. There are so many different facets and sides to me that it would drive a person crazy to try to document them. I can't even do it. ",1
   I thinkIdon't know what towritebutby thinking that i actually have womethingtowrite. in is hot and i am hungry. The lights on the computer keyboard are bright.

"Well I figured since I want to go to bed at midnight I would write for 20 minutes now so I don't forget. I always tend to think at night. Stuff runs through my mind because I let it wander. I don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing, but I do it anyway. I just finished studying for a chemistry test tomorrow. It is my first college test so I am a little nervous. I know that I have to do well in all my classes in order to get into medical school. I think I will do fine though. I have done all that stuff before in high school. So far the largest difference I have noticed between high school and college is that the professor expects you to know what he or she is talking about. They don't explain things as thoroughly as they do in high school. Oh well I guess I will become accustomed to it. I don't mind the reading I have to do so that isn't too bad. I have met a lot of new people here and I like the college a lot. One thing I do want though is a girlfriend. I like this one girl but she has a boyfriend back home so it is kind of hard. I seem to be able to pick out the ones that have boyfriends all ready. I was in the same situation almost with one of my good friends that just left for the Navy. I say almost because she liked me also, but had been going on with her boyfriend for a long time. We were friends back in seventh grade but then she moved and we kind of kept in touch through the years and then on day she called and I hadn't heard from her in over a year. I told her that we had to get together and do something. So I went over to her house for spring break and we spent the next two weeks together. I had so much fun. I felt as though we were meant for each other. It is kind of hard to explain the feeling I had when I was around her. Well I told her and she said that she liked me too but couldn't break up with her boyfriend and then go out with me. I asked her why not and she said that she couldn't be with me and then have to leave for the Navy. I talked to some of my friends and they said that it was because she knew that I would not let her leave and her current boyfriend would. I don't know if that is it or not, but regardless we went out a whole lot and spent a bunch of time together. I always had a wonderful time with her. Then I left and then she left. I came here and she is in Chicago for boot camp. I miss her a lot. Then I met this one girl from my high school, which I knew but not that well. In the last few weeks we have become real good friends. She reminds me of my friend in the Navy, and I can't figure out if that is one of the reasons that I like her or not. I think it might play a bit of a role in it, but I am not sure. Well she has a boyfriend also so I am in the same position as before only I am not sure how she feels towards me. I received a post card from my friend in the navy today. It felt good to hear from her. I have to write her back tomorrow. Well it is midnight so I think I am going to head to bed. I know that I will continue to think through the night. That is just what I do. ",1
"Well, here goes. I'm in my room right now and it's very warm. My housing  is not air conditioned. I'm not used to doing homework like this so you'll have to bear with me. I tried to do this assignment about a week ago. after some fifteen minutes I was kicked off. I was beyond pissed. My  ankle is itching. Yesterday we went to mar's and we waited outside and I sat in the grass. For some reason that makes my leg itch. I wind is  blowing in my room and it feels good. I am very tired and want to go back to sleep. I took an hour nap awhile ago. Matt came down. I hear people talking in the alley. One of them is a guy. I wish Matt could stay here with me in Austin. I miss him so much. I'm so pathetic. The tissue on  my computer is waving like a flag, so are the papers on my bulletin board. I need to call my tutors one day. I need one in math more than anything  else. I'm not stupid or anything, I just need assistance on the problems sometimes. Doug say's that I don't have a life. That I has no personality. That made my confidence soar. I know I didn't have a life, but I really couldn't help it. My parents are super, super strict and I wasn't allowed to do normal teenager stuff. Even now that I can Im restricted to because of my boyfriend Matt. He cam down tonight. I love him so much. He should be calling in about an hour to say that he got home safe and sound. He's mad at Doug because Doug wouldn't leave us alone today. I was kind of mad too. Doug doesn't like the thought of me and Matt spending time  together. He's weird like that. Matt should be nicer to his parents. They both have the mind set on he acts like a butt so I will too. Matt is very stubborn but his parents are not very nice. At least I had a close family. Matt doesn't even think that his parents love him. I know they do but he  doesn't think that they do. He still sees himself and their mistake. I  don't know what to tell him to believe otherwise. I'm going back home on  October 4th. Matt's birthday is on that weekend. Saturday will be a lot  of fun. After that Ill be going to the renaissance festival  with Matt and Doug. We're going to camp down there. It'll be a lot of fun. Doug  can be a lot of fun if he's not in his pouty mood. Maybe he'll find  himself a girlfriend by then. Then he'll be happy. I think. He didn't  seem to mind our relationship when he was dating. he was too into Amanda. I didn't like her and knew she was going to hurt him but as usual no one  listened to me. I like my room it's nice. I live at the women's co-ops. They are cool. All the girls in the house have made me feel completely  welcome. I've been typing for about ten minutes. I think that's pretty  good. If yall read this yall will have a lot to read. I'm trying to  type slow so this won't get too long. I'm typing about half of my normal typing speed. Doug liked Elyssa. He'd like to have her legs wrapped  around him. He is very crass. Then again Matt can be that way too. He is rarely rude to me though. I'm am usually respected and taken care of by my guys. I'm used to being protected. It's weird being down here knowing that I can actually be hurt. That is scary. My guys live two and a half hours away. We won the football game today. The tower is lit up. I love UT. I love the freedom I acquired when I came down here. It's not that  Im partying and getting drunk and toasted all the time. I just like that fact that I can if I want too. I don't have to beg to be let out of the house or anything. I've even been studying more down here than I did at home. I've kept up with all of my classes so far. I'll be doing some  of my homework tomorrow. I read the assigned readings in between classes. The written assignments that actually take time get done at home. I have a quiz in math Monday. My foot hurts. It's been reclining against the  chair too long. My hand hurts too. Its resting on the edge of my desk. I am getting all sticky and sweaty doing this paper. My legs are sweaty  against the seat. The back of my neck and my arms are also sweaty. Matt left his bobo feit action figure with me. He's the  bounty hunter from  star wars. I'm very surprised because he's very important to Matt. I am  honored that he did. It's on my desk right next to my pewter angel/moon and stars figurine. I got that with Matt in Florida. We went to Disney with the school marching band during spring break. The figurine cost me seventy bucks. It was definitely worth it. I've been typing for  a little over twenty minutes. Bye. ",1
"I wondering about what I should write here but I know that I'm just supposed to write what comes to mind. I just ate a chocolate cookie and now I'm craving some milk. My nose itches. I can see my shadow on the wall in front of me because of the light behind me. This chair is really uncomfortable. I need to buy a pillow to fit in it. Now I'm drawing a blank. Now I'm thinking about studying chemistry after I finish typing. But I don't understand the work, so I guess I should just wait and do the homework after I go to the discussion session tomorrow. My chemistry professor was ""sick"" today, but the sickout is not supposed to start until tomorrow. Maybe she really is sick. My arm hurts because the edge of the desk is sharp. Now my back itches. It's this darn chair that's making me so uncomfortable. Now I'm wondering if it matters if I type contractions or not. I know that in a proper English paper, I am not supposed to say ""isn't"" or ""I'm"" or anything like that. But this is a stream of consciousness so I guess there aren't any rules. I wonder when my roommate is going to get in tonight. I hope she doesn't walk in while I'm still typing this, then it will distract me. But then again, I'm not doing a very good job at focusing on my thoughts right now, anyway. Hmmm. my thoughts. I wish I had not just eaten that cookie. That's unnecessary calories and now I'm thirsty. I wish I could talk to this guy that I like, J. J. He's on a sixmonth float for the navy and I won't get to see him until spring break. But we care a lot about each other and email everyday. I wish I had some music on right now, but I don't know if I should listen to music right now, anyway, because that might mess up my thoughts, also. I hope I like this psychology class. I'm thinking about being a child psychologist. I love children. I want to have two kids. I think I want to have kids before I'm oh, 26. I don't want to die before my kids graduate. Larry King is 74 and his wife is pregnant. That's ridiculous. That's traumatic on the child, I think. I just popped my knuckles. My mom would always slap my hands when I did that in front of her. My nose really itches. Sitting here makes me notice all my aches and pains. My ankle hurts and my arms are hurting because of this desk. I need to repaint my toenails, but I'm so lazy. I want to go smoke a cigarette outside really quickly. But I only have 15 more minutes to type. Wow, only one fourth of the time has passed so far. I just popped my neck. That's probably not too good for me. I'm going to have arthritis everywhere by the time I'm 30. Now I'm trying to get more comfortable so I'm sitting indian style in this little bitty chair. My closet light is on and it's kind of bothering me. I hope I do well in all of my classes this semester. My easiest class is German but the rest I know I will have to put forth a lot of effort to do well in them. But I really think I'm going to enjoy this class. The first day I walked into psychology class last Wednesday, out of all the people in the auditorium, I happened to sit right next to someone I had met the night before. It really is a small world, even thought this is the biggest college in the nation right now. My roommate is a raver. She has all of these rave flyers all over the wall. I've never been to a rave, but I think I might go to one this Saturday. I'm not too pumped up about it, but I think I should at least give it a chance. I just hope I don't get drugged accidentally or something. And also, ravers wear really funny clothing. I'd look funny if I wore ""normal"" going out clothes to the rave, so I'm going to have to borrow my roommate's clothes. Okay, time is up. ",1
"Well, I'm not exactly sure what to write about. I just finished my prescreening for the Psychology Experiment stuff and I now have to 1. 5 credits for it. So I only have to get 3. 5 more I guess to get the 5. I hope the experiment things aren't anything to bad and they don't take that long. I hate typing when I have rings and bracelets on. I really like to wear jewelry but they just start to hurt me when they rub up against the keyboard holder thingy. I don't know how I'm going to be able to write straight for 20 minutes. I just took my bracelet off, it was really hurting. I have so much homework to do this weekend. I guess teachers (professors) think that since it's a long weekend we shoudl have time to do all kinds of stuff so they give us more work. I guess the professors don't realize that each teacher gives us more and we would like to have some free time too. I also have to go to all kinds of places this weekend. I have to go to Dallas to see my half sister because she's in the hospital for something, I really don't want to go though. We never talk anymore and why should I go see her when she can't even call me when she promises to. Oh, I met these friends at UT. They are so great. One of them really. Her name is Sarah and she's really nice. I think we might try to get an apartment together next year so we can live together and not have to put up with stupid roommates like the one I have this year. She lied to me about everything and I think she might be doing some kind of drugs or something. The other day I heard her talking to some friends about sniffing some kind of chemicals in some guy's dorm. I don't know what they were talking about, that is just what I heard. Carol is talking about Sarah right now to my dad while my mom is sleeping. She thinks Sarah is so cool. I wonder if what I eat is actually eating a lot or if I'm just eating a normal amount of food. I try to eat 3 meals a day even though the food isn't always great. Oh, Kinsolving isn't all that great. Some of the food is good, but I can't stand eating there every day. They need to have food on this campus other than chicken. I love chicken and I used to want it all the time, but now since I've been here I've been dying for beef. The other day I was so stupid. I was talking to Carol on the phone and I said, ""I'm tired, but I don't want to lay down. I'm bored but I don't want to do anything. I'm not hungry, but I'm dying for meat. ""  I bet I sounded so stupid. I drove home today from Austin. I really didn't want to becuase I haven't drove anywhere in like a month, but I really need to start driving again. I can't wait till I get to go to Casa Ole again. I can't believe Austin doesn't have them here. That is like the stupidest thing in the world. I take that back. The stupidest thing in the world is that UT doesn't sell Dr. Pepper anywhere!  How can they do that!  If you ask any person our age what soft drink they would prefer, the majority of them would say that they like Dr. Pepper the best. My mom just woke up. I finally found one places on campus that has it though. The Union has Dr. Pepper at the Taco Bell. I haven't checked anywhere else yet. My dad is talking about this guy's truck that got stolen today. I can't believe that happened. They live in a pretty good part of town and nothing like that ever happens here. My dogs are fighting. I have two dogs, Milo and Brewser. Milo is a red beagle that is Brewser's son and he turned a year old May 15, 2004. Brewser is a black beagle that turns 11 on October 11, 2004. It's weird to think of their age. Milo is really crazy and Brewser is really calm. It probably is because he is so old though. I felt so stupid today in Biology. We had to work in these small groups and figure out these questions the teacher told us to do and for the first question, I sort of knew the answer but I didn't have it completely right. The second question was to figure out the hypothesis out of a group of statements but it was hard. When I was in high school we were always told to write a hypothesis in ""If, Then"" form. Meaning that this would be an example, ""IF we put this together, THEN this should happen. ""  In this class though, its just a statement. No ifs. No thens. No questions. It just made me feel stupid cause I could pick the hypothesis out of the group. There there was the last question that she asked and I had no clue about it. All that really scared me though because I am afraid of not making it in Austin here at UT. Out of my high school we had 106 seniors. Out of those 106 there were 59 that went to college or went to some trade school or ARMY. Out of those 59, 35 went to aTm. I can't get over that. Only 2 of us came to UT and that is me and my ex boyfriend, Nathan. I am afraid of what all my aTm ""friends"" would say if I couldn't make it here. I really don't know what to talk about. I keep making all these stupid noises just because I can't think of what to say. My sister is now watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire and my dad just ate some M&Ms. My mom is out feeding Milo and Brewser. Oh, Milo is actually mine. I was too young for Brewser to actually be mine so he is actually my mom and dad's. Carol has a dog, ferret, and fish at her house in Temple. The dog's name is Bart. Carol is laughing at me because she is reading what I am writing and she thinks this is the stupidest assignment in the world. I have to say, that since I've been writing it, I have to agree. I think it's kind of cool, but I really don't see the point in having to write this all out. Well, I understand that it is cool to see how the mind thinks and how our brain processes information, but this sort of seems like a waste of time. Oh, well. I'm getting credit for it. Oh, I might get to go to my first concert pretty soon. I'm going to try to get to tickets to the Austin City Limits thing. Sarah and Gabby were telling me about it and while I was in class today they tried to go get tickets. Gabby got one but while Sarah was in line, they cut everybody off like 3 people in front of her.

"     Currently my mind is drifting from one focus to another. Today is my 9 month Anniversary with my girlfriend and best friend in my life. She is the best thing that ever happened to my life. I want to by her a ring and I have been giving it plenty of thought. I have been experiencing a guilt trip as of last night. I thought about my grandmother, who is affected my Alzheimer's. I felt gult come over me when I thought of all the times I yelled at her. I live my grandmother but thats not the damn of it. I generally understand that I am not truely mad at my grandmother when I yell at her. I am mad at the disease. I don't want to loose her or any other member of my family. I got addmitted to the Business school thats the reason I am here. And I have been thinking that I have not earned the opportunity of a lifetime that I am living. I worked harder than most and I played 4 sports and still graduated 16 of 400 in my Senior class. But again I feel guilt when a prodigous amount of people introduce themselves and they mention their major. What should be a privelege to me is actually the most dreaded words I could say,   I'm in the Business School.   People look at me in dismay and in a downward direction which I can officailly say bothers me. I love my mom. . She called me today and gave me a few more pointers that should have stayed under 2 minutes in our conversation. She is so worried about me. Oh and this paper im writing is helping me to think of all the things that are roaming in this spaceous mind I have. My roomie says that I complain alot. . do I. My girlfriend has said the same but I disagree with them both. I just want to be the best at everything and I have to win or im not happy. Just knowing that my effort was not enough haunts me for days. God made me competitive and thats the way I live. Back to that Business thing. . I worked my butt of to get into that school and this college. See my parents had a divorce my junior year of High School. Thus, my lack of attending school cause my grades to faulter as well as my happiness. My dad left us and I can still see tears in my mom's eyes as we carried opposite ends of the furniture and tears trinkled down her face. Besides that I'm in love and I have the best girl I could ever dream of. Her mom says we can't be together but all through our Senior year we stayed together. Sacrafice, that is what makes a best- friend a best friend. Not loyalty and all the Universal answers to what makes a best friend. She sacraficed her family to be with me. Her mom said,   either u have him and loose your family or you can listen to me and forget about him.   She chose me in an instant. . For a long time I woundered why. . And to this day the only answer I could find is love. True love is what we share and today is 9 months. Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it. My grandfather had to raise me since I never had a father. That hurts me more than the world could ever know. Oh another thought came to me. I am suffering from sexual frustration. I'm not sure if I can say that but you asked for whats on my mind not what you want to hear right?  Well me and my girlfriend have not seen each other for alomost a month and 1/2. Seems like forever but we will be fine. We pray every night for help and hope to some day get married. I nedd to buy a ring. . let me write that down. If i complain too much sorry. Thats just me right?   ",1
"As I sit in front of my computer, trying to put my thoughts into words all I can think about is how tired I am. I am unable to concentrate on any given task that is related to school. All I see in the corner of my eye, is my roommate trying on my favorite black dress. I can't help but laugh, because she just got the sudden urge to try on my clothes. I feel distracted in many ways, because while I am trying to write this psychology paper my friends keep coming in and out of my room. This makes me feel that I am missing out, and I want to join in on the fun. I am also feeling very excited, because tomorrow is finally Friday and I get to see my best friend from high school. She goes to A&M, and it will be interesting to see how life is in Aggieland. This week was stressful and I am ready for a break. I find this assignment quite hard for many reasons. I am not comfortable with expressing my feelings or thoughts to a stranger. I also find this paper difficult because I have so many random thoughts running through my head and I don't want to sound ignorant. For instance, right now I am wondering why our neighbors constantly blare their music. It is very annoying, and is hard to concentrate. Right now the phone is ringing, and I am yet again distracted. I wonder who is on the other end and I am disappointed to find out that the call is not for me. It is hard being a freshman at a huge university such as UT but it makes it a hundred times better because I am rooming with one of my best friends from high school. Right now I am thinking about how much laundry we have left to do. Not fun! I have been writing my thoughts now for about 20 minutes, and I feel as though I wrote probably the most boring paper ever but those were my thoughts that crossed my mind!  ",1
"     ok im sitting on my bed. i kind of wish i was at home on my bed. i like my new room a lot, and i like my new bed a lot but i miss home. i am not sad here but i just miss my old way of life and my old setting. i wish i could go back to elementary school. those were the good old days. i love my old neighborhood. i definitely want to send my kids to my elementary school. i miss the scots football games the most. i have been going to them since 5th grade, maybe? i love the atmosphere. everyone is happy and excited it is friday and you get to talk to everyone and its so fun! i like watching my friends play football and the feeling after we won. after i made belles, the scots games became even more fun. i can't explain that feeling, waiting to line up and dance on the field. you are so nervous and anxious and shaking. then the lieutenants bow and you scream for them and then the music starts. we strut out and its such an out-of-body experience. you are standing before thousands of people, and you are smiling so big and bright. not because you have to, but because you want to and you can't help it. i don't think its possible to not smile. then you get ready to dance. and you start dancing and its the best feeling in the world. you feel so weird. and you don't want to mess up. and when the music stops you are so proud. of yourself and of your team. and you stand up and strut out towards the crowd and all the fans are standing and cheering and clapping and smiling and you can't help but smile too. because all the parents are truly amazed. and all the little girls, the little girls that you used to be, are staring at you in awe. they want to be you so badly. because everyone in the community looks up to you. and you represent so much positive energy in the community. and the little boys want your autograph. and they want to date you when they're in high school. you feel like a celebrity. its your moment to shine. your fifteen minutes of fame. its ineffable. i can't describe the feeling, but its the best. i miss those days so much. i would give anything to go back to that. but i cant, and thats what kills me. i can't wait to go back to the scots game in a few weeks. it will be so weird to see my younger friends dancing. to my favorite dance ever. to my first dance on the field. it was the best dance anyone had seen. and the sad thing is, i won't be a part of it. it will be one of those bittersweet moments. i love those moments. i live for those moments. they make you so happy and so sad at the same time. it makes me so happy to reminisce in my favorite days. i don't know how i will feel when i go back to that stadium because it will be so different. most of my friends will be gone. i like my new lifestyle in college. its fine. but i loved what i had. i don't like getting older. im fine with where i was. i feel like my life is going by so fast. i feel like my best days are behind me. i can't believe how fast high school went by. if i could, i would go back and do it all over again. exactly the same way. i would make the same mistakes and everything. just to relive those incredible four years. they werent always fun, but it was a good experience. instead of reliving them, i would like to just watch it all on video. watch everything I've ever done. i miss camp too. i learned everything about life at camp. it makes me so sad to think im not a camper anymore. thats how i know im old. thats how i know my life is going by so fast. camp is pure happiness. all of my favorite things in life are behind me and i don't know what to do about it. i am really enjoying school here. like the classes itself are so interesting and im really enjoying them. but the work is becoming overwhelming. and i don't like   going out   at night. i don't like socializing with superficial people. i feel surrounded by sin. by people who only care about being cool or something. i just love the days when everyone was innocent. and it didnt matter what you did on the weekend. it didnt matter who your friends were as long as you were happy with them. everyone was nice. and on friday nights we would eat dinner at jacks and then go to the scots game. when everything was perfect. and you didnt worry about anything. seriously, stress wasnt an issue. school work was nothing because it was so easy. everything was done for you. you went to soccer practice and you went to school. that was it. it was so simple. did i realize that then? did i thoroughly enjoy it while i was there? or do i just love it looking back on it? i don't know why i like living in the past. but i enjoy dwelling in it. it makes me happy and sad at the same time. my best friend is the same way. she is the best person i know. i don't know how i will survive the next four years without her physically by my side everyday. she is the only person that fully understands me because she is me. she feels the same way. and how many times have we talked about these good old days? the elementary school that we loved so much and the scots games that were the highlight of our weekend. every chance we got. and i could do it again and again with her. even if we repeated the same words. just as long as i got to relive it for those few minutes. i can't believe life in my community is going on without me. i know my home is much quieter now. and i know my mom is longing for the days she walked me to elementary school, probably as much as i am. i wonder if when i leave college in four years ill be longing to go back to the beginning. should i be spending these moments living in the excitement because soon these will be the good old days? i can't see how they are. i like my dorm a lot. i can smell all these flowers. i can't believe im a pi phi. thats how i know im old. if i had chosen anything else, i would be denying my past. my mom is a part of me so thats why i chose what i chose. i have been waiting to be a pi phi for as long as i can remember. only i assumed i would be at smu. did i choose the right school? i didnt really choose because i wasnt ready to go and i don't think im ready to be here ",1
"I guess that I should start by telling you where I am. I am in my dorm room at Castilian. I only had one class today, Calculus. I don't really like Calculus that much. But it hasn't been too bad so far. I want to call my old band director and tell him good luck tonight. Tonight is their first football game and they are playing the Astrodome. I got to play in the Astrodome once. It was really cool. At first I was really envious of my friends still in high school because they were going to get to play there again. But then I realized that I was going to get to play at the UT Stadium and at many other great stadiums across the country throughout my time here at UT. My roommate is playing a video game now and I'd really rather be doing that. Not because I dislike this assignment, but because I haven't gotten to play any games in a long time. School and band are taking up a lot of my time. But I think that is good. I like to stay busy. Last year in high school I was in band, jazz band, choir, pop choir, mock trial, KEY club, a little student council, and track. I had a great time and was doing stuff constantly. I would like to have that kind of life here. I think that I would like to join a fraternity, Longhorn Singers, a Bible Study group, mock trial, and anything else I can find time for. I like being a part of many different things. That way I can have friends from all over and with many different interests. UT has been very interesting so far. I love the way my schedule works. I am through with my classes today and it is only 12:45 (The day by the way is Friday if anybody is actually reading this). I think that I would like for somebody to read this even though it isn't the most exciting paper in the world. At least then I wouldn't have written it just see how accurately I type. Anyways, I'm not sure what I should be writing about. Uhhhh. My parents are going to be here tonight. They are coming up here (or over here technically) to watch me march at my first college football game. My mom is really excited. My dad is also but he is also coming to see the game. My mom could careless about the game. All right! Only 3 more minutes. Uhhh. I have a really nice view of the city from my room. It's on the twentyfirst floor. It really sucks trying to get up here on an elevator though. And it's really hard trying to find a place to practice my trumpet in a dorm. I tried the roof but it was locked. I'm really hungry now and that's good because I only have about thirty more seconds to type. Yaady yaady yaady and now I'm done. I am going to go eat. Thank you to whoever has read this. And if nobody has or ever will, there isn't much that I can do about it. ",1
"I am typing this paper because I have to. My roommate is asleep. I am listening to Incubus music. I am listening to Incubus. I just got off the phone with my girlfriend. She was annoying me. She was saying all this stuff about how I was flirting with this fat girl. And I was like what I did not flirt with the fat girl. And we went back and forth and it was a stupid argument. But in the end we worked it out and we are still cool together and it is all good. The music I am listening to is so good I love listening to them. I am so mad. I did  my Calculus homework tonight and I missed a few problems. It makes me angry because my roommate and I both know Calculus and I should have gotten them all right. I missed a few which was stupid, but I corrected them. But still it makes me mad because the grading system is so stupid. If you keep guessing a question and get it wrong you get negative points. Which makes no sense because then you could get a negative one hundred instead of a maximum one hundred which means that you could get a -100 to a 100 which makes no sense. I am so mad at this stupid grading system. Because then I can get negative points and it will still make my grade negative but it will still hurt it a lot. I am really in a bad mood because our shower flooded tonight and so we have to call maintenance and they have to come and fix it. And I messed up on my homework so it is not a good night. I cannot wait for this week to be over. I am having a bad week. The song I am listening to now is really good and it is motivating me to type. I really have to go to the bathroom. I wish I could go. Oh well, the music is good. I really like this writing assignment because I can write about whatever I want. I wish all writing assignments were like this. It is so cool to be able to write about anything. I love writing about what I am thinking, it is almost like a diary. It is good to be able to write about my feelings, I think this assignment is very good. I hope my girlfriend is not mad, I just thought about that. We talked tonight, and I think she might be mad with some of the stuff that I told her. I really hope she is not because I love her with all my heart, I hope she is nor going to blow anything  ",1
"Right now I have a flood of emotions coming down on me. Maybe I'm just to sensitive. I feel that I close myself up when I'm around my friends. Why I do, I do not know. There are some friends of mine that I can just relax and worry about what they think of me. My other friends, I just do not know. It's not just that, but when I am around a group of certain people, I can not open myself to them. The reason why, is that in the past, when I have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. I am very sensitive to things of that matter. I do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when I do not talk to them. I act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. Things have changed since junior high and high school, but still I have to watch my back. Who knows what they say or think about me. I need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. I think I am a nice person and I am openminded about certain things. I feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then I will be there to listen. Whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. I still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. The reason why is that I do not think it is anybody's business. Well, I do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. We are not perfect. Humans have their little flaws here and there. I will admit to my flaws. There are some that I am embarrassed to admit which means I need to work on them. Speaking about working, I need to work out. I worked out only once this week, and I need to work out more. Over the summer, I worked out almost everyday. Well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. It was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. Even so, I still got my three to six times a week that I wanted to get. My clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. Still, I have some more work to go. It's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. I have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and I have not been as sick as I was in the past. Exercise and a good diet works. It can work miracles, and myself and thousands of people out there are living proofs. I can not afford to get sick right now, especially since school has started. If I was to become sick right now, I would be behind in all of my classes and that would not be fun. That would be bad. Let's hope that I do not go down that road. ",1
"It is 5:24 in the afternoon. I wonder how long 20 minutes really is and how much I can write. time always seems to go by so slow when Im bored out of my mind. it's too quiet in this room. usually there's people constantly talking, walking in and out, shouting, banging, or anything to cause distraction. you see, Im in my cousin frank's room. well, we're not really blood cousins, just cousins by marriage- his aunt married my uncle. anyway, he's pretty cool. I hated him when I was a kid. we were in the same Chinese class and he was one of those really annoying, obnoxious boys that always teased the girls. I guess we're pretty close now. it was pretty scary finding out we were cousins, but its fun calling each other that. ugh. Im so bored. the only noise I hear is the humming of the a/c which is right above the desk. it's hot, and the a. c. 's not cool enough to keep me comfortable. Im really paranoid about frank's room. he's a pretty messy guy, and someone just came in here complaining that there were fleas in here. yuck. I hate bugs of any shape and size. all I know is that Im beginning to feel itchy everywhere. man, it's only 5:35 now. about half way through this writing assignment. laddy da dee da. I don't know what to write. the more I sit here, the more impatient I get and the more paranoid I am about these bugs around me. frank lives inside an Asian fraternity house. Im not trying to say Asians are dirty, but sometimes the guys do get a little lazy. I wish they'd clean up a bit. even right after the clean, it's still a mess. it smells moldy, the lighting is really bad, the air is thick, and it just feels nasty walking in here. I hate taking showers or going to the bathroom here. the dim lights are constantly flickering, the seats are a dingy yellow/brown color, and it stinks like shit. and the one stall that's actually half way decent has no lights in it. I basically take a shower in the dark. and the worst part is that I paranoid about guys walking in and out of the bathroom while Im in there changing. all the guys here know me and respect my boyfriend, but it's just the thought of guys there. yes. it's 5:41. and frank and my friend Tony just got back. they're starting their own racing crew and just picked up stickers for their cars. mmm. and they brought back food. even though I don't like McDonalds, I always crave it when I smell it. oh well, Im just gonna eat some since my time's up. yeah!

"This is weird and different. I'm not exactly sure what I should be writing. I really love it when guys can play the guitar. I don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness. I hope, oh I forgot what I was going to say. that happens a lot. Twenty minutes seems like a long time. Anyway, I'm listening to Hotel California by The Eagles and then I think I'm going to listen to my Sublime Cd. The Beatles were like musical geniuses. I bet them and Frank Sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women. I would have had sex with Frank Sinatra back in the day. I made a list of celebrities I would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but I'll share it because I really don't care. It's not like I'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was Lindsay Lohan, Michael Vartan, John Mayer, and Jake Gyllenhaal. I bet John Mayer is an excellent lover. No one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover. Huh, I don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head. I'm so glad Stephie is my roommate. We have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well. Sex and the City is such an awesome show. I think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them. Is it bad that sometimes I want to push my morals aside and do things I know are ""wrong"". Since I've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style. I hate that they judge me. Why can't I just live my life the way I want to? Being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things I've ever done but now that I'm doing things that The Church wouldn't approve of I'm noticing that I'm pushing everything I used to stand for aside so that I can ""experiment"" with different things. I don't regret anything I do, but sometimes I don't think I make the best decisions. I'm happy though and I guess that's all that matters. I'm sure God is an understanding God. I'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life. sounds like a lose lose situation to me. I really need to lose some weight man. I was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210. So now she weighs. 137. wow. I need to lose that much weight. I wonder how she did it. I should have asked her. some days I'll feel really self confident and pretty and I'm like well I guess I love myself the way I am so someone will love me for me as well. Then other days I'm like ""fuck, who's going to love a fat slob"". I hope I meet the one in college. I hope he's amazing in every way. Is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? That would be sweet. First things first though. I need to shed the pounds ASAP. yes. After this I have to study Italian. That's going to suck. I probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away. oh well. This week was a lot more productive then last. So this weekend I plan to really catch up and get my shit together. I really need to pull my GPA up. I want to do good. I'm going to do good. I just wish I weren't so damn lazy. Bah. I wish I were going to college station tomorrow. I want to see my old friends but I don't know why if they're just going to look at me like I'm the devil. My leg is still twitching. That probably isn't a good thing. I'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend. I wish I could find someone who enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I miss Chris so much. I wish every time I was with him could be like that night after the John Mayer concert. he's so much fun to be around. I think I come off as bitchy and annoying but I'm not sure. I wish someone would tell me. I have the Beatles song ""Black bird"" stuck in my head. I want to take guitar lessons I just wish they weren't so damn expensive. I'm so glad I only have one class tomorrow! Yay! I kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better. Otherwise looks like I will be going to college station. We'll see how that works out. ",1
"It's only been a day since this is Monday and I already miss him. Got back from my trip last night and still had to call him I know that I'm not crazy but I wonder if it is bad to need someone in your life. What happens when they leave for some reason? I mean, school seems hard, and I need to think about studying and stuff, but all I want to do is talk to him and spend time with him. He told me once that he needed me. I think that was the best thing I ever heard him say or at least one of the best things he's ever said to me. I just know that this summer was even better than the last something I didn't think could happen. It sucks now though, even though I'm in a whole new place, and even though I should be excited about starting college, all I think about at night when I go to sleep is all the time we spent together this summer, and all the fun we had. Now, even though we are only an hour away from each other I still miss him. I worry about what will come of this semester. Will we stay strong? Or just fall apart because of the separation? We did okay last year and we were five hours away I thought that was hard, but ironically enough being closer to him is harder. That just means that on the weekends, I can tease myself with his presence and make the drive to San Antonio to see him, or vice versa. But I can't describe the way it feels to make the drive and feel the wind blasting through the car as my favorite songs ring through my ears, and then the excitement I feel as soon as I reach the point. The point that's what I call the restaurant that I pass on the way to San Antonio I believe it's a Marie Callenders  but anyways it means that within the next couple of minutes I will be with him. What does it mean to have a soul mate? I mean, I have heard explanations. but what do you do? How do you know that it's him? It's almost been twenty minutes, and I think I'll just keep typing, until I can leave the computer and study, finally. ",1
"I've done this type of assignment before. Sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. All I talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. Today I went to class and I though I would be late to spanish because I was coming straight from sociology class. I didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. I woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. It was hard to focus when all I'm thinking about during a class is how stupid I was to lock my bike up wrong. It didn't get stolen so that was good I just rode it back and I was fine. I hate riding along busy streets I never know if I should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. It's so crazy, usually I just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning I got up and ate yogurt too quickly I felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. It went away once I was able to drink some water and let time pass. For a while I was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. I always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. Yesterday was the first day that I used a push basket at the supermarket. I usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. It was kind of a weird feeling because it was like I was growing up or something. I have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when I was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. Next thing I know I'll be getting married and crap like that. I guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like I got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but I'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. I always think about the book Babbit, by Sinclair Lewis. He is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. It's really hard for me becuase he is very human. There are aspects of George Babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. I have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. If you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. But it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. It seems like every decision I make, I don't know if I should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. I'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. I would be afraid though that the more I ignore the small things, I might gradually start into the big things. I don't want to become like Kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. I'd like to think that I had restraint, but I have no clue if I do or not. I can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but Kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. I don't know if I would revert like he did, I hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. Heart of Darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. I read it for school last year and loved it, I read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. I really like Joseph COnrad, but I usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless I'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. Most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. I always talk about Heart of Darkness, William Shakespeare, and Lord Byron. I don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. Once I tried to tell this guy about Freud and the ID, EGO, and Superego. All the sober people told me that I was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. I don't know what to write right now, I have a lot going on right now. Most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but I never know. ",1
"Well, I just got back from my Zeta meeting. It was cool. After the meeting, we went to this show where this guy hypnotized people. It was so funny!  Some of my pledge sisters where some of the subjects. It was hillarious to see them and the funny things he made them do. I can't believe I waited until now to write this. I'm usually the type of person who gets things done ahead of time. I think all of this freedom makes me feel like I have nothing to do. I missed a homework assighnment in Kinesiology the other day. I couldn't believe it. Tomorrow we're going to have this ""relationship talk"" with the Delts. It's going to be really fun, I can't wait. This time is going by really slowly, I just know that I'm going to run out of stuff to say. I'm really hungry, I haven't eaten since 5:00. I've noticed that I eat more often now. I think it's because I work out (or try to) three times a week. I always feel so much better when I work out. Hopefully, I'll be able to keep it up for the rest of the year. The dreaded ""freshman fifteen""  is not going to get me!  This Thursday, I have a meeting with my doctor about my knee. It's been giving me problems. I had surgery on it last October. The crappy thing is that my other knee is starting to feel the same way. God, why was I born with ghetto knees?  Okay, I feel like I've been writing forever and it's onlt been 10 minutes. I am dreading all of the writing I'm going to have to do next semester. English is going to suck next semester!  I've never been any good at English. I don't enjoy it in the least bit. On the other hand, I love this psychology class!  Every day I get to come, I look forward to it. Our professor is hilarios. I don't know what it is that makes him such an awesome teacher, he just is. Every day, I come home and tell my roommate all that we discussed that day. I enjoy reading our textbook, I actually find the information interesting!  (much unlike my other classes)  I wish Psychology was a more job-promising field. I would definately look into it if it was. Okay, five more minutes, I think I can BS my way through it!  I'm waiting on my this guy Kevin to call me. I'm not sure what exactly he is to me. We're dating, and we wouldn't date anyone else, but I feel funny calling him my boyfriend. Okay, my roomate just blared the TV. If I did that while she was trying to do homework, she would eat my head off!!!!!  Okay this last minute will be used to sign off.

"I am really really really hot. I don't know what to say. My girlfriend just called she's going to New York. I have some pretty messed up feelings about that. To a certain extent I feel kinda abandoned going here to UT. All of my friends are going to that amazing just right school for them. Me. I took the easy cheap way out. I knew that I could get in here, so I only applied here. Thats not to say that I don't like it here, I really do. I think that it will be interesting. I am really hungry. My roomate isn't here, he's working. I get to go to the dining hall all by myself, and I get to sit down, all by myself, and I get to proceed to eat. all by myself. I really like my room. I don't know why, but for some reason It has just taken over and become home. I'm not sure what to think about this expirement. I know that I've done stream of concious writing before because I took some creative writing classes, but now I'm afraid that this is going to be used to analyze my brain and you're going to use it to steal my credit card number, and forge all sorts of stuff. Speaking of credit cards, I got my first today, and had to send it home with parents because you can only activate the cards from your home phone, what kind of messed up shit is that?  I'm sorry, I really should stop swearing. For some reason my mouth has to the potty since I started. I  d o n ' t  k n o w  w h a t  to  say. I'm sort of bored right now. And I'm sort of in a strange dillema. This is going to sound sort of like Jerry Springer. I don't know if I love my girlfriend. I mean, I do, that's not the issue. It's that she's going to New York, and I'm here. And I don't know what to do about that. I'm going out to see her at thanksgiving. I really miss what she brought to my life. It was that feeling of completeness. I know that this is bad, but I'm already starting to look around for something to replace that feeling that is gone. I think that long distance relationships suck. You know that I can type really really fast. Sometimes I think that I can type faster than I can think. Or maybe thats the other way around. Maybe that's the reason this is turning into somany things that I don't know were floating around inside my head. It is right now five fifty. I have ten minutes to go. I can't believe that you're going to actually read this. That is really impressive. I can't imagine reading six hundred different stream of concience writings. I think that either your going to grade them pass fail, or you're an insomniac with nothing better to do with your time. I really wish that I could have a totally silent computer. You know, that's not random, It has to the fact that right now it is humming. I would put in some music, but that would mean taking my hands from off of the keyboard, which is illegal. So instead I'll play the game by the rules, and sing along to something in my head. Jen, Jen, Jeeeee----eeen Jen, Jen. She doesn't fucking care are are. Whether I like her or not. Okay that didn't really work out. I hate how you can only remember the lyrics to one part of a song. You end up singing like this. Word Word Word, dum dum dee dum. This shit would be really funny if I could instead speak it to you. I gaurantee that I'm the guy who will never shut up. Although lately I feel that maybe I've been too quiet. I think it may be time to sing something in the dining hall, maybe that will make people want to sit with me. Only five minutes left. That means I can eat by my badass lonely self. It should be fun. Maybe I'll call this girl I know. The problem with that is that I don't know where or friendship begins and ends. I don't know if she even considers me a friend. Its a total fucking mystery to me. I want to sit her down and tell her look. I think that I like you. The problem is that I'm afraid of rejection and failure and all of that bad stuff. You see I think that maybe I would make a good psychiatrist, because I've been through some weird shit, and that would help me to understand what was going on in other people's minds. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just totally fucking alone in the world. It's a frightening thought. And there I go with the swearing thing again. I would go back and edit it for langauge and content, but I figure that you probably won't be reading this thing anyways, so what does it matter. I like the fact that you seem to know how to handle a big class. Sorry, I don't even know why I seem to be writing this to you. I really should be writing this to myself. And if I was writing this to myself, I think that maybe I would rather just mull over it in my own head, as opposed to online, on paper, on something. So that's what I'm going to do. Good bye Gotham City ",1
"I am reading a book called Atlas Shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel I've ever read. Ayn Rand wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of Objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that I feel are very important to all humans. I find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. Not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. The anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. Why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a ""fair"" chance. It really is disgusting. Just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. THIS IS STUPID. If those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they?  I also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. These are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. Personally I would hate knowing that I found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. I would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where I was. But not many people think like this anymore. I guess that I just have way too much faith in my abilities, but I'm glad I do. Ayn Rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. So in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called John Galt decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. He decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, Atlas Shrugged. So one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. It is such a great argument too. You should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. This is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. The men who build the world in this book form a secret Utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. Thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. Anyway, I have this friend called Jason and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. Actually he's not my friend anymore because I don't want such an asshole for a friend. He's the only person I've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. You hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as I am. He thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. The only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. I have heard say horrible things about all of his ""friends"" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. I've overheard him saying that he's set  in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 500000. This wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. Of course, this is probably the root of his problem. I've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. If he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. He doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. And, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. He really has sever problems. I guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what I mean, the biggest asshole ever. Anyway, uhmmmmmm, I went back home this weekend to get my car and I got to see my dog. I missed her more than I missed my parents. Shes so pretty. She's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, Just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. Pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. She had her tail between her legs all night long. My roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. He's listens to a different kind of music than I do, but that's cool, because I'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 20 minutes are up so bye bye. ",1

"Well. hmmm I'm not sure whtat to wirte here to monitor the mind I suppose  ihahve always been fascinated that the mind is the only organ that wants to study its'elf. i am a horrible typer . i'd like to think I'm fast but as what cost of accuracty. uhhhh. this is strange I'm trying to monitor my stream of consciousness but I am so aware of it as I perform this assignment that it does not seam to want to flow. i don't want to write down anything too embarrasing but why should that matter?  I'm in college not high school anymore. Social status amongst my peers really doesn't have any more bearing here. It doesn't matter what people think of me now. I don't have to worry about my appearanc all the time. though I still do. I suppose that's how shallow I am. I have to always know that I am looking good so that way I can feel good about myself. that helps me exude confidence. and that's attractive to women. But I'm not here to get a mate I'm here to get an education a degree so that way  I can be financially secure for the rest of my life but is that what the ultimate goal in life is. I think about this. is the ultimate goal in life to  make money, settle down, and start a family. to break this down means to say that we are to reproduce. buy why?  What is this necessary drive in humans and all creatures to propegate and keep the species going. basic nature to survive sure but then again why??  It seems like there should be other goals and other things to achieve in life. not necessarily to have children. will having children when I am older make me happy. i suppose so. I mean am I exactly like my father as he is exactly like his father before him. after all I'm already on the right track they both went to UT. but as much as I have fought with my dad in the past I think that I have done most everything in my life to please him and make him proud of me. I'm pretty sure that I have done that as he tells me that he is proud of me. i sure saw it in his face the day that I got my acceptance letter. i've never really seen my father cry before. but I think he  almost did when I yelled out that I'm going to be a Longhorn!!  That's something that I will never forget. the look on his face and the look on mom's. It makes me feel good to know that they are proud of me. but I have often wondered whether or not the things that I have accomplished in my life I did for myself or I did for them. i mean I have never regreted getting good grades or being in band and learning to play the trumpet. but did I do it all for myself or did I do it partly because I wanted mom and dad to be proud of me and to not have to be worried about me. hoping I won't turn out like Adam. It's not that my brother is a bad person. it's his mind right. Manic-depressive with bi-polar and narcisstic tendencies. and his refusal to take his medication. why??  I never understood what was so hard about taking his meds. he'd be fine but instead he chose drugs and alcohol. it's so weird I felt so bad like it was something that I could have fixed. something that was a problem that I had the answer to but it just wouldn't come out of my brain. consciously  I know that's not true. but deep down I still wish that there was something that I could have done. to keep him from hurting mom and dad and the rest of the family like he did. i never saw someone breakdown as much as my mother did. but Adam is better now I don't know if he's taking his med. but he. time's up ",1
"Many Why's are predominant. Why do I seem to feel unwanted at times?  Why do I seem to feel betrayed at times. Why do I seem to feel like a failure at times? Why do I seem to have lost a yearn for optimism?  Many of these feelings come and go but many do stay implanted in my head. My head is just a constant waterfall. Tons of ideas rushing through mixing at a point which creates pandemonium. My head is a maze which produces many blocks such as this Wall, why when my mother phones me I become bored all of a sudden? I love her dearly and I know that she must be lonely with all her kids off to College. It is because she misses me and because she loves me. Why can't I make that extra effort to make her feel wanted. What can't I give her the same feeling that she makes me feel. Emotions run one-sided in her phone calls. I feel a superfluous feeling of want and she must not feel any. Corrections can be made to this but I just don't try. How can I think that I am determined to do well in college?  How can I feel that I will be persistent and successful in life?  If I can feel determined, persistent, and successful in these things, then why is it that I feel determined, persistent, and successful, right before I speak to my mom in order to make her feel wanted and then I fail. Is this a preview of what is to come in my future, not only with family relations but also with life experiences. Will I continue to think ""I can"" and will I continue to fail? How can I practice my ways to perfect them. How can I execute my feelings and my hopes. How can I make them come true. How many times do I have to continue to tell myself that this is the way its going to be or that that is the way it is going to be and in the back of my mind I know that it will never be the way that I intend it to be. Does this mean that I am a failure?  What does it mean?  Should it be something to worry about. Will my mother some day get ""fed-up"" with me. Can this defect ruin my entire life?  Is it a defect?  Why do I think about this stuff? Is it just conscious nature? Why all these Whys I don't know, but what I do know is that there is purpose for everything, and maybe my purpose of life was to wonder why. ",1
"I am very tired bc I have been studying all day for various classes. I know that once the ball starts rolling its going to be hell. This semester is somewhat full of crazy classes for me. I can't believe that I am having to take these evening classes I much rather have my 8:00 classes so that I could go to work and make some money now I don't what I am going to do. I guess become a male escort ha ha. I guess whatever pays the bills and gets me through college. Alsoo on my mind is the fact that I am kind of seeing 2 girls. I find them both very interesting and suitable for my needs. Neither of them are materialistic which is great bc right now I am broke all I have to offer is my heart. I don't know bc about 2 weeks ago I was pretty much dateless and desperate and now I am seeing these two girls and I have two others wanting to go out sometime. This sucks because they are all great girls and I don't want to hurt either of them. But I can see that something bad is going to happen bc it always does. It always happens this way for me one minute nothing and when I start dating somebody seriously I suddenly become attractive again. I am just going to go with it and not lead anybody on. Man once again this sucks!!!   what else am I thinking about GRADUATING. I am tired of the school life I want to be out in the so called real world trying to fend for myself. Then again what am I talking about I am in the real world littl help from the parents and paying all the bills with the itty bitty pay checks I get. If I didn't have conscience I would be out there on the street corner selling drugs bc this barley getting by isn't cutting it. No money horrible job and always pissed off bc of this. Why can't my parents be rich. I wonder what its like to have everything given to you and never having to work for it. I just want to know what its like not having to worry about how am I going to pay the bills. And day in and day out I see these kids on campus without a worry in their mind. But do they appreciate this or do they take it for granted?  One can only wonder but I would be willing to bet its all taken for granted. But I guess like my dad said ""son now your going to learn the value of a dollar and all those other kids handed everything will never appreciate anything they have. ""  Hes not a educated man by any means but I believe he is right on this matter. For that reason I keep on keepin on wanting to gradute wanting to please my parents and mainly wanting to please myself. Now that I have rambled on for 20 minutes I am signing off. ",1
"I woke up this morning and my words from last night at 1am, ""Can I have a 6 piece chicken tender and small fries to go"" echoed in my ears. I felt guilty. Within five minutes of ordering I had scarfed down the whole thing. Although my body wasn't hungry, I was thinking about food and I started to have major cravings for something filling. I sent myself on a mission to quench my thoughts, not my stomach. Is it normal to eat when you think about food and your body isn't hungry? Does thinking about food imply that you really are hungry even though your stomach isn't growling? This also brings up the issue of will power. I usually have strong will power, but with food it is another story. My body feels weighted down by guilt today. I went to Tops the other day to look at pictures and I looked fat in all the pictures I saw of myself. I'm sure every freshman promises themselves that they won't gain the dreaded ""freshman fifteen. "" I refuse to believe that it is an inevitable event in my life right now. I know how to avoid gaining the weight; exercise, eat healthy food, and above all, don't have late night snacks. My will power crumbles late at night when I see food or if my belly doesn't have that full feeling. Getting out of bed I could feel the unused calories building up in my body. I didn't eat breakfast and went to the gym where I worked out for almost two hours today in hopes of burning off last night's calorie fest and hopefully today's too. When I returned to my room I was in a bad mood, felt very lonely and as I told my mom, ""I'm not feeling like myself. "" I was depressed. I only felt good about myself today when I was exercising. I wanted to go eat lunch, but I felt guilty about even thinking about eating. I love to eat. It brings me satisfaction, comfort, and pleasure. However, my body image tampers with my enjoyment. I am not over weight but I feel like it. As strong, smart, and confident as I am about myself and who I am, I have been sucked into the belief that I ought to be skinny. It is amazing how easily my mood depends on my eating habits. ",1
"As I sit here in front of my laptop, visions of the past 3 weeks of school flash through my mind. It has been a crazy, eventful, and stressful beginning to my college career. UT is the perfect place for me. The diversity of the students, the quality of the education, and the variety of extracurricular activities available are some of the many reasons that I chose to come here. Although I am completely content with my classes, my roomates, and my social life, today has been rough. Today, one year after 9/11/01, there have been strong feelings of sadness surrounding my thoughts. I cried this morning while watching the news, and again tonight at the ceremony at the tower. How will the families of the victims ever heal? My family experienced an unexpected death 2 years ago, and I know my Mom still cries at night. That sick, depressed feeling will forever haunt thouasands of people that were affected by the tradgedy on September 11. I cannot even contemplate their pain. I saw the different reactions of students tonight on the main lawn, and I know this tradegy affected people in different ways. Well, September 11 is a day that I will always remember and the families of the victims will always be in my prayers. However, in my religion, the one year anniversary of someone's death is observed and signified as a time for closure. It is my hope that on this one year anniversary, the United States will accept closure, but continue to express the pride and patriotism that we have been so boldly expressing throughout the year.

"As I listen to this music I think about when I was younger, when I had a friend named Casey. But is she still my friend, or not?  What about Joanna, she thousands of miles away in Korea. I really don't know what I feel for her. I want to be with her, but I don't think as much as she does with me. I feel guilty, but what have I done to her, I have been there for her, drove her around, let her cry in my arms. I must sound shallow, maybe not, I really don't know. Is she the one, I really don't know how to answer this question. What happens next, if she moves back, then she will probably live with me. I don't know if I can handle that. I have started talking to Heather, she is very sweet, but is just someone to latch on to or is she really special. It started out harmless enough, but we have really started talking, and I really like her, as much as Joanna I really can't say, shouldn't I be worried more about school, I have astronomy homework due Friday. I feel like I can almost tell when Heather is going to call or come in. right now she is one of my best friends, in a world that is new to me. in fact since I have been here, the best friend I have had. Heather has a very sweet personality and a good understanding of people. much like many people I have met, good or bad I really can't say. sometimes I catch eyes with her and my heart takes a drop, a feeling that I haven't had in a long while. that really feels good, it opens you back up, makes you feel good, alive, a purpose. if I do break it off with joanna, what will happen, will that be a big mistake what if she is the one. how can break it off with someone who is in Korea, that is cruel, she hasn't done anything to me, I haven't done anything to her though. you get to a point where living life in a certain way or doing something in a certain way is just not right anymore. or doesn't seem right, being or I am really not with her, just doesn't seem right. but if I am not with her anymore will it not seem right in that respect also. this subject is really what I hide from in life, am a an asshole, or I am just telling the truth to myself, I mean after all the school saying or whateveris YE SHALL TELL THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE is the truth making me free or tearing me apart, I think I do love joanna, that is the bummer part, but to go into it with the scales tipped is just wrong, maybe I am wrong, I really don't know  ",1
"     I'm feeling that I miss my girlfriend in San Antonio. As we do this i feel that she is my everthing i can't get her out of my head. what else I can't get out of my head is this music that the dorm next door to me is playing, it is making me really frustrated because i can't think quite as well. I hope that Jess is okay, i worry about her a lot. She doesn't sleep too well, and that kind of worries me but she is extremely strong so i'm not too worried about it. I am kind of worried about what she just wrote to me in a letter i got. I know that she loves me but this college stuff, being apart and all is quite difficult. I don't like it and neither does she, and she wrote something that worries me, that she kind of wishes that we never met so that we never fell in love and therefore never have to endure the hardship of parting. I miss her a lot. My days primarily consist of me waiting around for her to get to her computer so I can instant message her, and communicate with her, truly the highlight of my day. The rest of my day is that of school, college that is, and I feel somewhat like a hermit but not too much, because I have her. She really is my everything, and I know that we will be together, forever. One thing that I do feel uneasy about is the fact that she is a christian and that I am an Atheist. This hasn't played a part in our relationship, but I'm afraid that one day it will. I am a pacifist Atheist and therefore will usually ignore most people's idea's, I know that that is wrong but oh well it's the way that I feel. I really don't want to destroy her sense of spirituality either, I've done it before to other people and it really makes them feel bad, and lost. I don't ever want to hurt Jess, I love her, in fact I feel that I have to protect her from everything. I miss her, I don't like the fact that I have to be here in Austin and she is nearly by herself in San Antonio. But there is a glimer of hope, we might get an apartment together next year. I really hope that we do, that would be so great. I can think of nothing better than waking up to her smiling face everyday, and thinking to myself that I am the luckiest guy in the world. I hope that that happens, it really does help to have something that you can think about while you are away from someone that you love. All I can think about is how great it is when I make my bi-monthly trips during the weekends to see her. In fact I'm trying to plan something this weekend for her to make her feel as special as she really is. I think the world of Jess. I don't know what I'm going to plan yet, I just can't think with this music, it really does irritate me quite a bit, I'm thinking that after the twenty minutes are up that I will go over there and tell them to turn it down. I love Jess. I wish that I was with her right now, in fact sometimes I wish that I didn't have to go to college, just stay with her were we used to work forever. Just being together with nothing to stop us, no one to get in the way, and no time constraints placed upon us. I love her very much. Wow, I just looked at the clock and I have used 17 minutes already, only three to go. Man, my fingers are getting tired from typing so much. I can usually get about 30 words a minute out, but I'm out thinking my typing, I want to write something down, and then bam another thought is in my head, my fingers can't keep up. I sure hope that I finish soon, because I see that my Jess is online and that I want to talk to her real soon, this is the stuff that I wait hours for, just a chance to talk to her to be with her always. She is my everything, and I care for her deeply. I do get to see her on Friday and I'm really happy. I hope that she will have as much fun as I will. I can't stop thinking about Jess. ",1
"Hey you, So far so good, I've got Chem done and don't have to worry about this when I finish typing. wish I could type faster, without the errors too, that'd be great. Like Tony the tiger. Anyways, I'm happy as of the moment. I get to see Anthony today, and any day that that happens is a good day for me. (At least, most of the time)  =)   I like rings, that was the only thing I could think of. Sometimes when I write, (normally I write letters/notes to people) in this ""stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell) type of writing. But sometimes I try to be random and that just isn't fair to anyone. I  don't like this delete button, (I just don't like the fact I have to use it so much) anyways. I've been waking up on time so far. What has it been, 5 days? dear me, I'll never keep it up, being such not a morning person and all. But maybe I'll adjust, or not. I want internet access in my room, I don't' have it yet, but I will on Wed??? I think. But that ain't soon enough, cause I got calculus homework due by then, and I hate using the library computers or Jackie's. She's such a good friend, what would I ever do without her? no one knows. not even me, or you, whoever you are. Sorry I'm not interesting today, must have picked a bad day. The phrase ""academics first"" just seems to be such a lie. Cause everywhere you go, it seems that ""athletics is first"" or at least that's how it is in high school. Where you're AP physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 1 class every week, (and you only have 2 or 3 classes a week to begin with) anyways. it's a pet peeve of mine. What others do I have? I'm not sure at the moment, I'm not sure about a lot of things though. Anthony is always saying ""you don't' know a lot do you?"" and it's true, cause when I don't' know, I don't know, and I admit it. I wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday. I always wanted to see if I could beat one. But I can't lie very well to begin with. Can't lie to Mom, Jackie, and Anthony. but everyone else I can pass a few things by. By the way, (there's is nothing to add on to that, it was just what I thought) That's what you get when you assign this type of assignment. but I'm not complaining, I really enjoy it. it lets me think. cause when I think in my head, it doesn't' really work, I still don't know what I'm thinking. but when I write it, then I can at least see what I'm trying to think. My finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing. I must sound like a hick when I talk/type. but that's okay, cause I'm Texan and if that's what it takes to be Texan, then so be it. Damn don't' I sound spiffy. (not really) don't' know why people (Anthony) hates Texas so much. I mean, common on! It don't ever get cold. That's the best part. (well it does sometimes, but not as much as other places)  Finish. I type what I read, and then go from there. Can you find the ""finish button"". Oh, yesterday I had the overbearing urge to watch the ""fox and the hound"". Why? I don't' know. Don't' care to much either. ""Hi I'm Copper!. I'm Todd. "" One D or two. I don't' know. Don't' think I care too much either about that. What do I care about? Can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there is something. Anthony, grades. (Anthony's my Boy friend by the way) Look, there's that phrase, ""by the way' again. BTW. Blah. that always reminds me of Jackie, (my friend, happy PR chick) ""Blah"" does. She says it a lot, and now I'm saying it a little more. Hmmm. 2 mins!   The brisket will be ready in 1 hour!. sorry that commercial always pops up in my head when I start counting down. Down the hill, over the hill. Where's grandmother? Who knows? I guess I Don't. Do you? Good question. bye for now, farewell. Godspeed. Choa! Bye. ~ME. Oh I didn't know that we could keep going after the ending. I was all prepared to stop and all. Well I'd keep writing, but I'm sure I have stuff to do, and this ain't ever going to be read anyways. so adios amigos!. ~ME Man, I type slow.  ",1
"     ok here goes i am starting to write for my psych class and i have just switched my roommate. She hated the three of us and i don't really understand as to why. Well, actually i can because we did talk alot of smack about her but we gave her a chance and she never would reciprocate. So my new roommate is in the process of getting situated right now as i type and i wonder what she thinks about me. She seems pretty cool and i hope she is going to be the kind of roommate i was looking for all along. i really miss my boyfriend. He is working and i wonder if he is thinking about me at the same time as i do. i hope he will call soon for i know he will but hopefully not right now because i am in the middle of writing for twenty minutes straight. I just started thinking about how i took a class over the summer on writing. that was weird. anyway, ozzy ozbourne is on his show right now on mtv and i remember how my dad didnt think it was very appropriate that i watch the show when it first came out. That reminds me, i am upset since he doesnt think that it is appropriate for my boyfriend Joe to come and stay with me until he has a place. i went to walmart today and was getting so frustrated with all the mexican people who were crawling all over the place. It was ridiculous. i wonder what my suitemates are laughing about. this sucks having to right this im telling my roomates about this project thing right now. it is for psychology. man my fart smells. i need to take a shower and dump. thanks for getting my new table. umm ya my lava lamp is purple and clear. shutup erica. hi lerrin. joe is hot says erica. my parents can suck it if he stays. i wonder what they would say if they knew that trey had stayed with us for a week since he cannot find a place in austin. he goes to southwest and i think the people there are incredibly nice, despite what some say. i dread having to read two chapters in chemistry but i know i will do it for i am the determined driven type. the ozzy show cusses more than i do which i think is incredibly weird. i almost threw out arielle's shit today because she made me go through the whole ordeal of moving in again and my mom thought i was pissed at her but i was just upset in general. joe suggested that i throw her shit out in the hall because she was being such a bitch. i wonder if i can cuss on this assignment?  well if not i apologize for my french. some la madeline's sounds really good right about now. i shouldnt be eating so much because you know what they say- freshman fifteen!  erica keeps bothering me about writing this thing i have to fart again. i want to go eat some pringles and ranch dip but then i will feel fat and probably be even more gaseous than already stated. do you ever wonder if people talk technically so they feel smarter as well as to sound smart. why do such people need to feel that way. just go through life doing your own thing and not worry about what others think because in the long run all of that will be forgotten. by lerrin. whats the point becuase the things that matter are all you will remember when you are dying in your bed when you are approximately eighty years old. my biggest fear is that of dying. sometimes i lay at night and wonder what it would feel like not to breathe and that is the scariest thing to me. i hope that i go fast or in my sleep so i don't know that i am consiously dying. did i spell that right?  well im too lazy to go back and change it anyways if it was spelled wrong. i am so happy i finally got my glasses in the mail because my eyes are just dying and i know that i havent been taking good care of them. sometimes i just think that i will get that laser surgery and i use that as my reasoning to my lack of nurture to them now.  I wish my best friend amy would call me. i knew that i would be replaced but i didnt think it would be so soon. i know soccer is a tough schedule at st eds but she doesnt even make an effort to call anymore but i am part to blame as well. im glad no one is instant messaging me right now because that would suck because i wouldnt be able to talk to them. stop interrupting me ashley and stop trying to be cool with kirby because she will figure you out quick and decide if she wants to make you her business. but thanks for running to walmart for me and im sorry i complained all day but its probably because i am on pms time right now. i wonder who is going to read these and what the real purpose is or even if you really do read this. i has made me feel better and calmer that i am typing about what i am feeling and thinking. i am worried about money and my financial situation right now. kirby says we are normal. i think she is really pretty and skinny. i am going to have alot of fun with her. but i hope that i don't get carried away too much because school is my number one priority. i need to get a job and i would be much happier. i don't even have enough for tuition next semester and my parents said they would help but they backed out and i have great resentment for that. i am tempted to ask my older brother but because i am independent i know i will not ask. i hope you enjoyed reading this.

"I have twenty minutes to write. It feels weird that I'll be writing about anything that is going on in my head right now. Looking at the keyboard. It's a black keyboard. I'm so hungry right now. I haven't eaten anything today except a bottle of Nouriche and some cookies. I'll be eating at Kinsolving after I'm done with this assignment. Is that what I am thinking about right now? Eating? Actually, there is no thought in my mind right now. Or it's just that I am too concentrated on thinking about this writing assignment. What's the purpose of life? ha-ha. I think about that a lot. What really is the purpose of life? People all die. Some people with their names left behind and some with no recognition in their lives whatsoever. How am I going to be like? Which of those two will I become? My parents expect a lot from me. It might be because I am the oldest child. But it really does put a lot of pressure on my shoulders. I know they love me a lot, too. Ahhh. What am I saying. Love. ?? What is 'true' love?? A guy falls in love with a girl. And does all kinds of crazy things for her. Then. All of a sudden. He falls OUT of love. And starts looking for another girl to fall IN love with. It doesn't make sense. Nothing in the world makes sense. I want to be an energetic, fun-loving person. But I tend to take things seriously. How can a person be fun? ha-ha. I met a girl yesterday. And she made us(my friends and I) laugh so hard. The entire time she was with us. I wish I could be that kind of person, too. Hmm. Stream of thoughts. What am I really thinking right now? ha-ha. I don't know again. I don't think I'm really thinking at all. I'm just concentrating on typing now. NOT THINKING. or am I? I am confused. &. &. money. I want LOTS and LOTS of money. Money can buy everything. Actually. Every materialistic things. I have 8 minutes left on the clock to write. I want to go to New York. That was really random. Ha-ha Well. I want to travel all around the world. And taste their food. happy thoughts. Happy thoughts. what are some happy thought. ?? basking under the sun. ?? No. I hate getting tanned. eating delicious foods. ?? No. I hate gaining weight. Well. But I do love eating. Especially eating delicious foods. but also very worried about gaining weight. Vocabulary. I had to memorize tons of them to prepare for SAT. very random. Why do people dream the way they dream? I have very weird dreams sometimes. And whenever I do not feel well. as in I feel lonely or sad. I get really weird dreams that make me feel really really really weird. I hate dreams that feel like reality. I've had many dejavus. 4 minutes left on the clock. I want this assignment to be over so fast. I don't know what to write. Well. I have to write what I'm thinking, but I don't know what I'm thinking. Houston. Well. Houston is a really hot and humid place. Austin is hot and humid as well. But Houston is really really worse. I think I have allergies. Hatred. Is a strong word. Hating someone is not good for the people who hate, either. well. Now 2 minutes left on the clock. psychology seems very interesting. psychology. Study of people's minds. how does my mind work? I want to try the lie detector thingy. ha-ha. I want to try it on other people to see if they lie or not. I'm sitting up straight right now. ENTIRE 20 minutes.

"I have been extremely pissed off for the entire day. I have just started classes again at UT. I am trying to get into the pharmacy school. I work at a pharmacy now, but the people there are driving me insane. I have panic disorder, but lately instead of panicking I am just angry. I almost ran into about 5 cars driving on mo-pac. road rage?!  My therapist is trying to assure me that I am not the one who is crazy - it's just the people around me. My job, my parents, my friends"". I am taking things out on John who does not deserve it - he is just here all the time. I wrote him a nasty email and I think he just replied. He is so sweet, I really should make a HUGE effort not to do that to him. he is probably used to it after 3 years. yuck. I would have been tired of my temper tantrums a long time ago. I tried acupuncture today for anxiety and my irritable bowel syndrome. The guy treating me at the student clinic was a moron. I usually get good people. he is graduating soon from that academy and I am scared of what he will do to his patients. I am going to take a xanax now and see how long it takes me to calm down. Cool, I can time it. ready, go. ok. I have to work all weekend when I need to be studying. my wrist hurts. maybe from typing, maybe from that moron. this should be pretty interesting for someone to read. I have lots of other homework that I could be doing, but this is all I have the brain power for right now. no offense, but it's not biochemistry. I am glad to be back in school. I hit the wrong key and it stopped for like 3 seconds. weird. I have to work with john the head pharmacist this weekend. they are all trying to manipulate me into working more hours than I want to. they have now told me that if I don't work all of these hours that they will find someone else to work there. it's all or nothing. I know they are bluffing, because it would take them so long to train someone that one of the other techs that works at the store would have to cover the weekends for months. no one wants to work weekends. so I should do it because I'm in school and that's easier for me because I am a student. that's their logic. that's crap. I think I'm almost done bitching. I am going to work tomorrow and if he doesn't make some compromise with me then I may just walk out and let him work by himself. that won't happen. he will say anything to keep me there. and I'll probably fall for it and think everything is ok and then he will just change his mind at the end of the weekend. so, I should just change jobs, or just change stores. Eckerd's sucks - they all have their heads up their butts. AAAAH! I guess I feel a little better now, but not much. I will just have to think about something else if I am going to feel better. my glasses are foggy. they always get scratched because I don't take care of them. I need an eye exam. haven't had one since grade school. who says grade school? I'm old. I have to be good this weekend. even though I am going to a birthday party that will probably be not quite as good as I need to be. whatever, that didn't make sense. I wonder when john will be home. at least I'm getting something done. I need to do a lot of things. I need to send transcripts to UT, start looking at pharm apps. and ask john if he is really going to move with me if I go out of state. I will probably get in for next fall but you never can tell. I applied way too late last year and got stuck on the stupid alternate list. ok, next/      ",1
"I probably will not get too much typed because I type kind of slow. Anyway,  my Girlfriend is not talking to me today. It actually started yesterday because she says that I don't back her up. Whatever. Anyway, Lately we have been getting into a lot of fights. I think she is only PMSing this time thought. Oh well. Ernie left his Binaca on my desk. He better leave today,  That boys got to go home. I'm actually typing kind of fast now. Johnny's Pekkle is so dirty. I need to make more friends. I also need to call either Jefferson or James and find out when the IEEE meeting is tonight. I still have to write for 12 more minutes. It took me a long time to Get on to the psy homepage. I wonder why because all the other Internet sites I go to always show up real fast. I guess Kristine is not going to go with me to sign up for psychology experiments. By the way I thing that these experiments that we have to do are BS. I think that that the psychology department needs someone to experiment on so they make the psy301 students be the guinea pigs( I think I spelled that wrong. Oh well. )  If we don't do the experiments they punish the students by making them write a 5 to 10 page paper. Ultimatum. I really need to work on my spelling but I won't. Oh yea I also have to pay the $4 it owe UT. I'll do that by TEX after I finish this essay. I still have 4 minute left. I really hate writing papers. I'm Glad that I got out of English. Everybody says that I need to get into study groups if I want to survive Engineering. I Need to get into some study groups I guess. By the way I didn't mean to caps the ""need"" in the last sentence. Oh well. It's 2:36 So I guess I'm about done now. LALALALALALALALALA ",1
"I mean. like I am really burning up. I got this really huge headache. I need some medicine. I wonder what is going on in UT right now?  I wonder if the football team won. I think I am beginning to like it there. It's a lot better than being in Houston now. It's so humid. I enjoy the air in Austin. Well most of it. Like the smog is getting bad up there. Other than that I  like it. I wonder what I can do while I am here. There is like no one here anymore. My whole life is still in UT. Hmm. I wonder who I should go back to UT with? Tai or Paul?  As long as they can fit all my stuff it's all good. I hope I cam get my computer up there soon. I can finally feel I am back in contact with the rest of the world. I hope I get a really awesome computer. I can finally quit begging my roommate to use his computer. Just asking him to use is it is like a big master plan. He is so protective of his computer. But that's ok. once he sees this 'baby' that I got, it's going to be a whole different ball game! rrHahahah. Even though I had some problems with my roommate at first, now things are a little better. I can actually open the door wide open!! What a luxury!! Oh jeez I forgot to do my laundry!!  I better to do before I go back to UT. I'll have stinky clothes everywhere. I got to get some CDs from my friend before I go back to. Free games and software for my computer. Ultimate hook up!.  And food for when I get back to UT. That Jester food can really get to you. I swear sometimes I think they have fillers in there are something. Cause. I can usually eat like a lot. but at Jester. I can eat a hamburger and get full instantly!. But there food. I think is not too healthy. so I find myself going to Gregory gym more often now. I never used to workout in high school cause you had to pay membership just to get in. Good thing Gregory is free as long as you are a student there. I feel healthier now then when I was in high school. I played tennis for high school,  but. I get more satisfaction when I can workout when I want to than. continuously playing. I get burnt out easily that way. ",1
"What an odd assignment, write about anything for 20 minutes straight. I really like UT but it is so huge, sometimes I wished I had stayed in College Station. My boyfriend and friends are still in College Station, I was so close to Houston and that is were my family resides. Its only a hour and a half drive but from Austin its an extra 30 minutes and you can definitely feel the difference when driving. My brother is nearby in San Marcos and that is only spitting distance from here. While living at home this past summer I didn't like it that much, now I really miss those crazy people I call my family. There was always a fair share of fighting but in some weird way that is how we express our love. I really need to start working out again because living in Austin is making me chubby. You would think that walking around campus would be enough exercise but you are sadly mistaking. I have so much math homework which by the way is due tomorrow, I can't wait to see my boyfriend who is coming in tomorrow. Its our 6 month anniversary and most of the relationship has been a long distance one. I have known him for about 2 years now and its definitely better to be friends first. My family loves him except for my crazy step dad, he is pretty weird guy anyways. He is always grumpy about something especially when it comes to money. Money really is the root of all evil, but you can't live comfortably without it. Everything is so expensive now and days, the cost of gas is absolutely outrages. What is crazy is that me and my boyfriends anniversary is on such a tragic day in American history. So many innocent people lot their live for no apparent good reason, and it all happened instantly. Its very scary to think that today could be your last on this earth. Its hard to imagine what I would do if somebody close to me perished in such a horrific way. Its hard to think about without getting emotional. I would hate to grow old and have to watch my loved ones pass first, I would rather go before everyone even thought that sounds greedy. Its pouring down rain right now, and I hate living alone when the weather is nasty outside. I'm tired of being broke it seems to suck my spirit right out of me sometimes, I definitely feel I'm paying my dues though and hopefully I can do something positive with this college education. ",1
"I'm in the computer lab upstairs. I don't know what to write. there are a lot of people here. the computer next to me is broken but I don't know how. the guy who was sitting there earlier was kinda cute in a nerdy sort of way. some guy just walked behind me. there was a loud noise just now. dont know what it was though. kinda scared me cause I thought I did something wrong and the people who control the computers would come after me and make me pay a million dollars for the entire system. wow the girl next to me got a long email. I got a few emails today. why do people wear socks with sandals?  don't they know it doesn't look good?  the computer screen is huge. I bet you a million dollars that this is the stupidest writing assignment you will get back from a student. I don't really measure up to the rest of the class. wow the girl next to me is typing really slowly. I'm in the I section. how come on some computers I and l look the same and they also look like 1. ewwwwww that girl should NOT be wearing something so tight. I've been at this computer for a long time. how come there are so many blonde people here. I wouldn't want to have yellow hair. I want headphones so I can listen to music. I'll bring them next time. I'd do this from my room, but I don't have my Ethernet set up because the computer store doesn't have any software there. recycling is weird. why don't they make it a law that you have to recycle. and if you don't recycle, you get fined like a million dollars. why do people read when they should log onto their computer?  I mean, there are TONS of people waiting to use computers and then you have people like this who read instead of type. why do people sit at booths in the cafeteria alone?  don't they have common sense?  a booth is not for one person. it's for more than one person. that's why there are tables everywhere. so you can eat at tables alone in the corner instead of taking up a whole booth alone. there should be a law against that. Id enforce it. Emily's boyfriend's name is Steve. that's my boyfriend's name. only her boyfriend is close by. mine is far. it's sad. she's going to go out with me and her boyfriend this weekend. she's gonna have sex with him.

I want to change the temp but then it might be too hot. every place is freezing here and it's hot as hell outside. is hell a bad word?  why do people think it's bad?  and why is God Damn so bad?  you can say ass on TV but not god damn?  and who decided it was bad anyway?  I wrote a high school essay about it one time but I have no idea. why are bad words bad words?  who decided they were bad. I want glasses. I think it makes you look smarter if you get a good pair that is. the computer next to me is broken. that noise was loud again. same noise as before. green is a cool color. forest green though. not the crappy lime greens and other green colors. forest green. aha!  Im right under the vent. that's why Im freezing. I can't wait for Melrose place tonight. Ive been waiting all summer for it. do you think Amanda's gonna leave?  she can't. she's my favorite. Im glad Allison left. Billys a whiner. glad they killed Brooke off. ever watch 90210?  it's stupid. why do they have Braille on the number things that say what station you're on?

I want to go down to the mail place and be able to say ""WOAH I GOT MAIL"". :( This paper was a cool one to write. I wanna do it again but I'll have to wait until tomorrow. I skipped class today. don't know why. I was lazy. I need to shape up or ship out. I never liked that phrase. who wants to ship out?  how can you ship out?  we're all on land. not at sea.

Id like to know what other people think about me though. might be interesting. time's up. I gotta go check my mail. ",1
"I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that Austin is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in Austin, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good. But I don't even remember what position he plays anymore. The reason that I don't really like football is that I don't understand the rules very well, and I think that if I knew them better then I would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. I am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. I like to do more calm, less active things. One of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. I wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. I wonder how long that marriage will last. But I am glad to be going to her wedding, because I will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. I haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. Well, I am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so I must end here. ",1
"Today I went to class at 8AM. I didn't want to get up at all. Even though I slept by 11PM, it was really hard to wake up this morning. I do not look forward towards Tuesdays and Thursdays. My first class today at 8AM was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful. Also, when I got up there I didn't learn a bit. You know how in Charlie Brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah. "", the teacher's aid voice just seemed to trail away. As the class neared the end, I left early so that I could go home and catch a couple of z's before my next class which was at 11AM. Soon as I got home, I just fell asleep almost instantaneously. For some odd reason, I had a dream of home. Maybe I do miss it more than I think. By 10:30AM, I woke up to get myself prepared for the next class. I left late and arrived to class late, leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door. Taking notes is such a pain in the ass, when trying to use your legs as a desk. I just sat there thinking about the repetitive information. Then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example, I blanked out and started to think about what I should do when I get home (back to my dorm) and that I needed to study for a quiz the next class. After the very monotonous class was over, I head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate. I think he is feeling the same way as I do, tired, hungry, nostalgic, and lethargic. After lunch, I got prepared for my quiz. I ended up studying for 10 minutes at most. I should have studied more but I wasn't up to it. After studying a little, I watched the news and then headed for a class. I also went to that class a little late. For some reason, today has just been an ""off"" day. I think I did rather well on that quiz and the information didn't seem like it was ""out of this world. ""                 I guess the best way to track my feelings/ thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way I felt and thought about my day. I feel like this day was pointless in some way and that I should have done something productive. It seems like I always feel like that. The only thing I've achieved today was canceling my friend's plane ticket from Northwest Arkansas to Austin. She was coming to watch the old rivals play. I cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation. Other than that I set up my new computer and caught up with the news in Iraq and in California and also the hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. I think I need to be motivated more. Someone to tell me that I need to go do something or someone to go do something with. I guess it's because I am feeling nostalgia. Back at home, I usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever. But in this new setting and the freedom, I haven't done too much. Maybe I am doing more than the usual because I've finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and I'm just thinking that I need to do more. I guess it'll take me a while to get use to the college life. ",1
"wow this page is not really what I was expecting. besides that ticking timer thing in the top is distracting me because I see it ticking. damn I tried to scroll down thinking I could move it out of my view to avoid distraction but it won't scroll. typing is annoying me. I can do it fairly well and fast without looking but I keep screwing up random letters and making typos and I'm tired of using backspace. well then. I just picked on my face and now it kinda hurts on my chin. I just looked and the timer and it already says 2 minutes. wow this is going faster than I thought. I actually thought I wouldn't mind this assignment too much because it seems kinda fun to just type whatever a persons thoughts are. plus its not a typical assignment. I love when assignments have time limits. my right arm hurts. its a bad setup for typing at my desk. all my computer and everything is diagonal so it can fit but its bad to type this way for long periods of time. I just had so much trouble typing the I"" in periods for some reason. it was annoying me. wow 5 minutes. I keep having to adjust in my seat. not so comfortable and my legs are not feeling right. there's no good place to put them. and my underwear are riding into my ass. its really fucking annoying. ok I fixed it. well I thought so. ok I think that's better now. I just got a blank and for a second I was actually thinking about nothing. or it seemed to be nothing. is that even possible?  I don't think it is. I think probably someone is always thinking about something. maybe they just don't know what it is consciously or something. there's people screaming in the hallway. someone wants to get into a room or something. man this is kinda frustrating because I keep feeling like I'm trying to actually say things worthwhile and then when I start talking about what I'm thinking about I think about other things in the middle of a word or something and it throws me off and just generally confuses me. well I still have about 10 minutes of useless babbling to do. my boyfriend is one of the things that keeps randomly popping into my head and when I'm about to type it, my ass hurts or there's people screaming in the hallway or something. so then I'm thinking about that. I like to think about my boyfriend. sometimes I actually do it on purpose. and then other times I'm trying to pay attention in class or something and it becomes a distraction. anyway I don't really know where I'm going with this. my roommate let me read hers (she just did this a minute ago) and mine sounds a lot like hers - its kinda freaky. I think there's holes in this stream of consciousness theory (that looks funny I don't think its spelled right. I didn't think something else up there looked right either but I don't remember what it was. )  the holes!  I can't type as fast as I think and therefore I can't really keep up with what I'm actually thinking about. but its kinda clever anyway. there should be a way to actually hear peoples thoughts while they're thinking them or something like that. like ummm  what women want. but actually I don't really want anyone to be able to hear my thoughts just for the sake of science. because that's assuming someone could hear them whenever they wanted to and that's just creepy. I'm sitting weird and its hurting my right leg. and now my left arm hurts. I adjusted earlier to try and solve the diagonal thing (aha!  that's what was spelled wrong earlier. heheh. )  um someones knocking on our door. its weird. my roommate said come in and they went away. I don't know what's going on actually. rebeccas bitching because ""quiet time starts at ten. ""  that's true though. maybe they had the wrong room or something. this is a hard assignment for me because I'm anal and I don't want to leave things unfinished and I keep doing that. I wanted to finish what I was saying earlier. ooo 19:36. the time draws near. this is kinda strangely fun actually I might do it sometime. probably not ",1
"I am hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. I have a chemistry test on Thursday and I do not understand some of the stuff. I hope nobody comes to my home on Wednesday night. Usually people are always at my home and I don't get any studies done. They stay until 2 or 3 at night and then it is too late to study. Why don't I study in my room? Probably because I don't want to study when people are outside partying. Why don't you go to the library? I don't want to go to the library. After 5, I don't want to have anything to do with school. I don't want to think it even exists. Library reminds of school. On Wednesday, I get off at 5. Good I have until 9 to study until people come over. 4 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. I am just worrying over nothing. I actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. Just do your studies early and then party later. I had heard there were fine women in this university but I was fooled. I haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. All the girls on campus have the same old stuff. Legs and other stuff that I do not want to mention here. I am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. Like a perfect package. Well whatever it is damn hot outside. I have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. Then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. Then take the bus home and then study again. Then I hang out with my friends. Which makes doing all this worth it. And I would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. They need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. I have do go through all this crap and then I can't even get a decent ride home. ",1
"So here are twenty minutes of Brian's thoughts. As I sit here, I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans. Today I talked to a coworker about religion. He found out that I'm agnostic and proceeded to proselytize. I can respect this, because his religion dictates that people who don't accept Jesus Christ will go to hell. But at the same time, I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible. He wasn't able to counter my arguments, and he responded only by saying that he has faith. This epitomizes human ignorance. I have faith the chair I'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me. This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to, in fact, exist. Yet he claims he has ""faith"" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they've seen. I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we'll never see. I've never seen this elephant, but I KNOW it's there. I have faith. It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit. What the fuck is that all about? How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this?? It is incomprehensible to me. I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes. Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space, so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning. Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that! Who needs logic and reason anyway? And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion! It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they're so incompatible. It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid. Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion, albeit at a crawling pace. And even so, rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion (absolute truth, mind you) to fit our current society and way of life. I'm dumbfounded. It also amazes me how closedminded people can be. I'm gay. Big deal. Yet many people (though a few proportion in Austin) perceive me as evil for it. My actions are vile and disgusting to them. Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature, though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior. And don't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical, reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality. People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to ""recruit. "" At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts, I can't believe how moronic our society is, on average. We even have Al Gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of Procter and Gamble and Home Depot, Inc. Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will ""choose"" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per Richard Dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from Brian's ultraliberal mind. ",1
"     Today was a very hot day, and I think because I wole up too late I never fully got into the flow of the day. But ohh well it is over now and this is the last requirement that I have. Once this is done I am home free and ready to begin the best portion of the week, the weekend. I am sitting in Laurens room writing this and I am smelling the cigarets and seeing the ashes that she has left in front of me. I think I really want to quit smoking also because I can feel how much it is taking its toll on my health. I think another reason why today was difficul to get through was because I am still very sore from rugby practice that was last night. Finally we are getting into the scrimaging and off of such concentration on the fundamentals of the game. There are only so many times that I can sit and do the same drills over and over. I really like being in this room, I think that it is because it is a away from my room and into a house where everyone who lives here I am friends with. So I always enjoy comming over here. This is actually kind of hard. I don't think that I will be able to continually write in a stream of conciousness for twenty minutes. But what the hell I am giving it my best shot. Now someone has walked in so I now have something else to tune out while I write this. Well I think that , actually I have no idea what I was about to say. Anyways looking around the room trying to find something to write about. Well I actually went to all of my classes today. And I have gone to them now for ywo straight days. It is kind of hard especually concidering that I have four classes on Monday Wendsday and Friday. Tuesdays and Thursdays off. I figured when  i signed up for these classes that It would be nice to have two days off a week but actually the whole plan kind of sucks. I never want to go through all four classes. I always want to leave early and really i always do. Then when you go home that night I always think that it is time to get real fucked u because there is no school for me tomorrow. Well that happens and before I know it the next day has come and half gone. Always it is about three o clock and I am staring practice in the face at six. Once that is over I want to go out agian but the problem is that I have homework in four classes that freally should be done before I go to the next class. And if you bow that off and decide not to do it and to just go out your problems just become exponentially worse the next day. Great isnt it. It was real brilliant thinking on my part. Next semester I am going to sign up for two hours a day everyday so it is nice and spread out. Red green blur pink orange white black purple white blue think don't stop this writing keep it continuous. It is going to be fun to learn what I am actually doing this for once I touch the button on the bootom of the screen to go to the next screen. I also hate the bus comming home. I have to wait for the city bus instead of a UT shuttle bus so I can be waiting for thirty minutes which is not fun at all. Then get on the bus. Airconditioning is nicve and cram yourself next to a lot of people that smell bad, I know I smell bad too but it sucks that wee even have to smell eachother. And the I want it to just take me to my stop, not stop at every bus stop along the way and let everyone else off. Is that selfish really who cares,  It was just today that triggered that becauser it took so long. One minute left I can keep this continuous keep writing, writninhgg. writing, anyways this has been just wonderful writing this. I hope that all o our assignments are this much fun. I have really gotten a lot oof thids ",1
"Well this labor day was good. i got to spend it with some very special people to me, and also since it was my b-day, I got to have a lot of fun with those people! hehe gosh. i spent a full 3 dayz a way from home, and not a care about school! Well I take that back, since I am doing one of my psy assignments. hehehe. but none the less, I did not really think about homework! hehe it is great!  I wonder why everyone thinks I am a freak!! I just don't like veggies! Is that so hard to believe? They just don't taste good to me. much like steak does not taste good to vegitarians! Sheeesh. i take more shit about that than I do about anything else. haha  hmmm. soo I need to be getting back to austin here pretty soon, so I can get some of my other work done, and actually go to work! But I really don't want to. haha. why is it that our society has become based on laziness? Why is it that everyone thinks it is better not to work? When did this change from a hard working, earn your living, society come about?    Our society is degenerating!! Ain't it sad! Sheeeesh. we could. man. oh well. my 20 minutes is up! GUess you don't get to hear the end of that one! :)   ",1
"I am in the library trying to get my work done but I keep on thinking on what else o need to do. I hope I get adjusted to college life quicker so I will not be as stressed out as I am now. I am going home next weekend to see my family and all of my friends, I hope that they are all doing well. Some of my classes are pouring down on the homework and I am getting more worried as the days go by. tomorrow I have to essays due for one of my classes and I kind of do not understand them. I will be glas after I take my first tests and ace them all. Everybody was telling me that college will be hard if you get caught up in all of the other activities, so I am trying to stay focused on my studies rather than on extra things. I have been sleeping late and getting up early so I am tired for class but I have to force myself to stay awake and focus. After I am done writing this essay I have to start doing all of my other work so I can beat the deadlines and not wait until the last minute. When I get home I have to go to the gym and workout, orgainize my room and then cook myself some dinner. I have to watch what I eat or else I will put on weight and not be healthy. That will affect my studies and others. I hope that my family is doing well because I know that my mom is having a hard time letting me go to college because we were alone together for four years while my sisters were away at college. She already has a stressful life working 50 hours a week, driving home 45 minutes each day in traffic and then coming home and cooking for my sisters and me. I can just pray that she is not taking it to hard and will realize that this is something that I have to do. When I get out of college I hope to accomplish many of my goals that I have set for myself. Like having a great job that will pay me good money because of my great GPA, making a nice happy home with kids and a beautiful wife and doing anything that my family needs. I hope the relationship that I am in with this girl lasts for a lifetime because we are so good together and we love each other a lot. I am greatly attached to my girlfriend and I hope that I will be able to have her as my beautiful wife and have great children with her. I will see what happens through college and hopefully everything goes well. ",1
"I am thinking about the fact that since I have gone to college I have absolutely no free time. I am so extremely tired, and I know that I can't go to sleep because I have so much homework to do. It is 12:40 in the morning and I just got home, from things that I had to do today. I am scared that everyone is mad that they never get to see me. My girlfriend probably thinks that I am trying to avoid her, but really I have no free time at all. The whole fraternity thing is fun, but I never have any time to do anything. I have met so many awesome people, and I am excited that I have only been here for 3 weeks and I have met people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. My school work is also quite time consuming. What I do know is that I hope that I make my grades this semester. Tonight was a rough night, I think that I have done more work than I ever have in my whole life. My dorm room seems secondary to other places that I have to be during the day. The only time I am ever here, is when I am sleeping. My life has changed drastically, but I know it will all turn out great. I am sad for some of my friends from high school. Most of my best friends came to school down here, and the ones who did not seem scared. I still talk to my best friend, who I dated last year. Her birthday is this weekend, and she is not even going to spend it with her best friends. If I could be there for her I would, but I am extremely busy this weekend. I bought tickets to the Dave Matthews concert in Dallas this weekend, but I am not going to be able to go. My whole plan was to surprise my best friend with tickets, and myself in Dallas but of course it fell through. There are so many things that I want to do, but I feel swamped. I wonder what it is like for my parents, they are empty nesters this year for the first time in 30 years. 30 years they have had a child in the house, and suddenly nobody. I did not receive a good wrist band for the Texas OU draw, and I couldn't get tickets to the game. That makes me mad that I sat in line for three hours to get tickets, but I received none. Well I guess that is just another one of life's great blunders, standing in line. ",1
"I am wondering whether or not I should try out for the dance team. In away I want to so I will have something to be a part of but at the same time I'm fearing the inevitable rejection. Rather than be rejected I'm just not going to try but then I'll always wonder whether or not I could have made it if I had tried. If I do try out and then I fail everybody will know that I FAILED AND I'll be embarrassed. I risked failure when I pledged but I did it anyway. My neighbor failed and I didn't think any less of her so why should I think any less of myself. I'll look fat in the leotard and tights, but one reason I want to do it is so I'll stay in shape. Everything is too competitive. I wonder what my cats doing since when you gave this assignment you mentioned a dos so I started to think about my cat. Then the picture frame I got today since I have a picture of my cat but I have to get another frame for my cat picture. My entire room is decorated in cat things. I found a gecko in my room today. There not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when I lived in Arizona. they used to be at least a foot long. I wonder what I'm going to do tomorrow I have reading to do in the morning. I can't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods. My mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check, how stupid. that what you get for having an English teacher for a mother. I want to get a calendar to put up all my things. Im scared to death I'll miss something like a homework assignment or test. I wonder if I need to be studying more often. It seems like I'm not doing enough. I don't know what I'll do if I fail. I hope I'm doing this write. It seems like the paper is just going on and on and on. I seem to worry about failure alot. I hate typing, I never memorized where the keys were so I keep goofing. My parents always told me to take typing but I was too lazy and afraid I was going to not get an A. I wonder how my sister got involved, society of women engineers. I say a bent today on the way to class. The other graduate students are coming on the 19 here. I bet it would be easier if I didn't repeat to myself what I was typing I need to go by the Newman center to meet n9ice boys. Why bother I never going to get married I probably not even going to get good grades and I'll never get in to med school and I'm going to flunk out. God I hope not or I'll end up as a house wife not that that's bad but I always wanted a career and my sisters so successful. My parents would be so disappointed. Now I'm starting to sound negative like that survey said but I was much more optimistic in the survey I wonder if those ever prove anything or if people really lie to themselves when they're doing those even though they think they're being realistic this girl beside me took forever doing the survey. How much time do I have left? IS anybody even ever going to read this? Probably  that was why it was done on the internet that reminds me of the guy I sat next to in Chem. I hope he doesn't think that I was offended by his remark it doesn't bother me I'm used to it with Adam and all. I feel like I've typed forever and it looks like nothing on this sheet the way it goes to infinity on the right. I keep on thinking about what to type instead of just typing what I'm think I just its just a habit from writing so many in class essays and such I'm so happy I passed the AP that way I don't have to take any English classes and I showed Mr. Cody and my mother I wonder what Patrick's doing. He got a 5. The girl at dinner the other night was so stupid she thought she got a 560 and the SAT's and the AP's were the same thing that's why I'm not a pom that and the fact I'm not talented enough since I spent a lot of high school studying instead of dancing or anything else. I can't imagine having three hours of practice a day. I guess I had as much with games and all but it seems like a lot less. I had a ton of fun at games though and wouldn't have given it up for it now. That's how I tell whether or not it was worth it if I would trade it for something else now not that I could go back and repeat it so I guess it doesn't matter anyway.   ",1
"The incredible sense of freedom I feel is probably what I feel the most. I walk around looking at all the other students and I feel like all these people are the future of my children. College is one step up in my step ladder of life and I think it is overwhelming for all freshman. Right now I have this great motivation that I am hoping will last through the rest of the semester and hopefully the year. I'm glad to be away from home. I thought college (my classes in particular) would be horrible. My past professors in high school had warned my that I would HAVE to take calculus and most of my professors would be foreigners whose accents I wouldn't be able to understand. They warned me that I would be lucky to be able to understand their handwriting as well. Well things turned out totally different. My major is advertising which means I only need 3 hours of math, which I placed out of by taking the SAT II. So I don't have to try and solve a calculus problem ever again. I also don't have any foreign professors this semester either. Everyone's handwriting is quite legible and clear. I enjoy all my classes. Every teacher makes me laugh. I'm wondering if I'm just lucky or is college not as bad as everyone makes it sound. I love the technology that teachers use today. I love that if I miss a class, which I haven't yet, I can just hook up to the web and get my class notes for the day. The internet is clearly a life saver. I feel sorry for all the past college graduates who didn't get to benefit from the internet. Right now I am appreciating the fact that I can type without looking at the keyboard because I notice some people around me having some trouble. I've met a very diverse crowd of people within the past week and a half that I have been here in Austin. It's very exciting to know there are so many people around you that are from various ethnic origins. One thing that I'll definitely have to get used to is how I don't recognize anyone when I walk from class to class. In high school everyone knows everyone and at UT it is quite different. My older sister is a psychology major from Incarnate Word University in San Antonio. I'm eager to tell her all about my psychology class and what I learn. I've already read about her major and know a little bit more about it after reading it in our textbook. I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and to more assignments which don't require a handwritten rough draft. ",1
"I still feel sleepy because I just got up a few minutes ago. I am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. My computer told me that I misspelled consciousness, but I don't believe it. I have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. I lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so I'm still mad about that since I only found out a little while ago. It makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. The book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and I just lost the last two lectures. Oh well. I am thinking that I am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. The WP still thinks that I can't spell and I'm becoming irritated because I can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. I thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. It's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. I wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. Hot, probably. I can't wait for the cool weather to come. This oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and I love to do stuff outside. Well, that's not true. It doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. I'm thinking that I've already written a lot for only about 9 minutes. Makes you wonder. I am wishing that I had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since I paid for them. I need a better study ethic. I think that I've been putting in about half the studying that I need to, but I haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so I'm not sure whether I should worry yet. I'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and I've been thinking about that a lot lately. I feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. Maybe after a while, I won't feel that way anymore. I'm sure I won't, just look at my sister. And my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. I feel I should include my brother. I worry sometimes how I come off, how other people see me. But other times, I couldn't care less how they see me. I think it's justified, I'm not a hypocrite, I just have an idea of myself and how I want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that I make an effort on them, and with other things, if I don't seem to care, then that is how I want to be seen. I realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what I'm comfortable with. I don't believe in diaries. If I ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then I wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. I would destroy it. Kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. ""Destroy it. "" Like it came from a movie or something. ""Destroy it. "" I'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and I think that I've spent too much time correcting typos. Not that I make a lot of typos, but when I do, I always go back and fix them before I go on with my writing. I'm feeling sleepy again and I think I'll go make some coffee. ",1
"I enjoy my life so much right now, but I am also at a really tuff time in my life right now. I love Austin and UT, but my boyfriend lives back home. Things are great between us, but it is so hard not being able to see him everyday. I miss the little things, like just being able to drive 5 minutes to go to his house, now it takes me over three hours to go to his house. I guess though that when I do get to see him, that the time we spend together is more valuable. I never realized how much we took for granted the fact that we used to live so close together. Now just to hear his voice costs money. I miss him so much. I have faith that things will work out between us, it is just going to be a long hard road through college. We have a lot of growing up to do though too. We both have a huge jealously problem, which is part of the reason we broke up the first time we were together. Whenever trusted each other enough to let the other one go out with their friends, so we were always together, and eventually I guess we just got bored of each other. I think the biggest mistake we ever made, was breaking up because a lot of things happened during the time we were broken up that puts strain on our relationship now. Although I have to thank my parents for sending me down to provisionals this summer, because when I left, Adam realized that if we did not work things out soon, we were never going to be together again, because I was not going to wait around for him. I love Adam so much, I thank God everyday that I met him. He has been my best friend for three years now, and I couldn't think of anyone that has helped me through as much stuff as he has. He has always been there for me, except for when we broke up, and he only left because it hurt him to be around me. Other than that Adam is the person that has helped me through the toughest times in my life. No matter what happened during the day, Adam can always make me feel better. He can make all my worries fade. ",1
"now the computer is making noise. I wonder why it does that. I have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. I guess that is what it is doing but I am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is Quentin and I am in psychology 301 with Pennebaker. so far I have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. I am not for sure if it is because I find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and / or interesting in his way of presenting the material. Either way I enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. I am starving too. I wonder what we are having at the Phi Gam house for lunch today. it better be good. I am starving. I have had a bad headache all day too. I hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because I haven't eaten lunch yet. I t will probably go away when i8 eat. it usually does. tonight I have a lot of homework to do. Chemistry is keeping me very busy. I had no idea that Chem204 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. I wonder if I will play catch with Scott again today. it will probably be good for me if I do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. I wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. I wonder of pres. Clinton is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with Monica Lewinsky like he did. that was really stupid of him. I can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. I bet Hillary is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what I saw. that sucked that I had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. I wonder how long Aikman will be at he is supposed to be out for 4 to 8 weeks. I think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. I never knew he went to UCLA until this weekend when they said it during the Horns v. UCLA game. I wish we would have won that game, but I really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. I hope that is caries over to the Kansas St. Game. if we would win that game it would be so large. I wonder if we are still going to be in the top 25 pole after this weekend. I hope so. we did look crappy during the first half of the game though. it will probably boot us out. Ricky did good, he better win the heisman. he is good enough to that is for sure. I wonder if all of my friends had fun in Cali. while they were there for the game. I hope I get to go to Cali. for some reason in the near future. I have never gotten to go there before. I think I get to go this summer with Jenny and her family if they still go. that would be fun. Mom and Dad head for England in about 2 weeks or less. they are going to have a blast. I wish I could go, but is have to stay for school. ugh. that sucks. oh well, I want to go on a cruise sometime too. I think that would be the most fun. I can't even imagine how nice those big ships must be. I have seen pictures but that is all. I hope I can go on one of those one day. maybe for my honeymoon. who knows. ",1
"hahaha, I really like the directions of how to tell Sherlock Campbell our UT EID and such. I wonder if that is weird to him. Sherlock is an interesting name, you don't here that every day. its a good thing there's a clock on here, I didn't look to see the time for this assignment. I don't really know what to think. I'm thirsty. my roommate needs to control the noise from her computer, its annoying. my face itches. there goes the noise again. I need to clean my side of the room. why do I have so many cords on my desk, but my roommate has maybe 2?  I think I have a rash on my arm, and it itches. I need to go return my nutrition book to the co-op. eew, a duck on tv has oil all over it. what is the purpose of this commercial?  DAWN?!  that's stupid. that girl from Everybody Loves Raymond is a spokesperson for too many things, and when I say too many, I mean 2 different companies. but that's still odd. to me. my arm still itches. I never did anything about being thirsty. wow, I never realized how long 20 minutes is. all of this was written in 5 min:33 sec. CRAZY!  is dr pennebaker really going to read this?  I wonder how many crazy people he has in his class thinking about obscure things. too bad I couldn't do this while I'm driving, I think of some really random things when I'm in the car by myself. I like alone time. I love driving home to Dallas by myself, PLENTY of thinking time. I need to go to Wal-Mart. but I don't remember what for. hmm. why did I need to go?  this is going to bug me. I think I want to be a Texas Sweetheart. the informational meeting is at 6 tonight. I wonder if I'll make it by the time I finish this. I just noticed that I capitalize random letters. well, they're not random because if it's capitalized, its supposed to be. but I don't capitalize everything that needs to be. so that's weird. I wish I could think of more interesting things. I miss my boyfriend travis. TV without sound is funny. mmhmm I love this bar, this song makes me laugh. I really do wish I were more entertaining for you dr. I love dr pepper. I wish I knew someone named dr pepper. my orthopedic dr is named dr payne. I had a teacher in high school named mrs payne. and mr axe. can you imagine what kind of torture my high school was?  no, I loved high school. I love the fact I'm out!  I still miss my boyfriend. I wonder how many times I think about him during the day. I should start keeping tally. nah, that would be a waste of ink. country singers make me laugh. MUCH cooler than pop stars - they're all stuck up. but man, country singers and music lovers. so funny. hahahaha, this music video is funny. I laugh at things easily. people like being friends with me because I laugh easily. it boosts their self confidence I think. my arm still itches. I wish that pretesting thing would work so I can start on that. that meeting is in 20 minutes. should I go?  yeah I'll go. 3 more minutes in this assignment. I still wish I were more interesting though. the guy in this video just poured a latte on himself. now my leg itches. I love the band Lonestar. back to the arm. soooooo, basically this was filled with how my body itches. I bet that's interesting. there goes my head. what's with that?  I don't understand. I don't think I usually itch this much. I dunno, maybe I do. my stomach just made a noise. 20 more seconds. lalalalalalalalalala. and DAVE MATTHEWS BAND rules! :) have a great day! ",1
"Well, to begin with I am simply thinking that I don't think I can type for 20 minutes without my fingers cramping up. But that is Ok I suppose since I doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students, I don't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts. Confusion is a funny thing. It comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often. At least I think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often. Even when you know exactly what to do, sometimes you can get confused because you don't want to do what you are supposed to. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. (In a manner of speaking)  I am thinking that I am tired of writing about confusion. It's kind of like thinking about thinking. I heard that it is bad for you to do that. I think it destroys brain cells. But then again, a lot of things destroy brain cells. Drugs destroy brain cells. I don't do drugs because I don't think I have very many brain cells to spare. Wow, only 5 minutes have passed!  That is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and I don't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and I am taking no chances with that kind of stuff. I know how sneaky teachers can be. I know how sneaky students can be. Some chick was all cheating on out Math Quiz today. I don't know who she was, but she was just flipping through her notes. The teacher had no clue. He was too busy daydreaming. I could have cheated also, but I don't like to cheat. I think that if my best isn't good enough for the professors at UT, then too bad, I'll go to community college. I would rather have a degree from ACC that I earned than one from UT that I cheated my way to getting. I think most people would agree with me but who knows!  I tend to think that people are good. But that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once. Take for instance my good friend Tiffany. Yes, good ol' tiffany. I loved her to death. We were really good friends. We did everything together. Then one day I found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend, John. That was quite a shock to me. I was so depressed. I didn't even want to get out of bed. I did, but it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. I was really very in love with him and I thought that he was in love with me too. I guess that is just one example of how stupid I am. So I guess I learned from my experience. People aren't as good as you would want them to be. But then again maybe I didn't learn jack. because the next guy I went out with was a jerk too. Well, he actually was a decent guy. At least that is what I said to everyone when they told me he was a ""player"". Oh gosh I still have 7 more minutes. Well anyways, they told me he was a player but he said that he thought I was the most beautiful person he had ever met, inside and out. That was it, I was hooked. That is all I have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that I was special. He made me feel pretty and he told me I had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person. I loved hearing him say that. I was willing to risk everything. I even compromised my friendship with my roomate. See, she said they were just friends, and so did he, but then when him and I went out for the first time, she was very pist off. I didn't know why, but it became a suspicion of mine that she secretly liked him. I asked her about it, and she denied it. But I still to this day do not know what to think about her liking him. I mean, she did encourage me an unususal amount to break up with him. Not that it would do her any good because he really would never go out with her. But still, I wonder sometimes if she ever did like him. She is a strong willed person and I thought that she would just come clean and admit it if she did. But the thing about strong people is that most of the time they are often weak. they are just good actors and can hide it better than the rest of us. I think all humans can have the same amount of strenghth. I think that if you just pretend to be strong, then everyone will think you are strong. It is from this facade that you can draw strenght. Take for instance Omar. I act like I don't care about him at all when really I still care for him a lot. Now, since everyone thinks I am strong I just pretend that I don't care about him and it helps me to deal with it when we are around each other. I guess I kind of slipped the other day when I got drunk and called him on the telephone at 4:00 in the morning. Hey, I hope nobody reads this because this is some embarassing stuff and I really don't think that anyone should know about my loser life except for me and the Power Macintosh. OK well I am pretty much done now. I guess that wasn't so hard after all. I hope the next assignment is this easy. Not that my hands aren't going to cramp up when I finally press submit. Ok, I'm done. ",1
Im sitting at the computer. I just got done working out. my arms and chest are sore. The pain is good though. I want to go out. I want to start playing golf again but it is too expensive golf is fun but I like to go out partying but its expensive my girlfriend is bothering me oh well I like it my friend is talking about a boat it makes it harder to write but it is ok because Im using his computer I want to play lacrosse but it is very rough I dont understand how they play but dont hurt themselves badly ya know well anyway I feel like running oh not really it is weird how my mind says stupid things that make no sense I think I will go to the steamboat and watch those two girls play again this will be their last time to ever play like it is a monumental breakup or something but hey what if one of them becomes good maybe I will be able to say yo man I saw them play live. noway  bro yea. cool They are pretty good I cant believe e I ever liked country music because it is all so fake I mean nobody writes there songs they dont do anything but sing and look pretty especially the women. if you are ugly it is nearly impossible to be a country singer. unless you are Leann Rimes then you can tell every one that you are 14 and thats ok because instead of the rednecks saying damn shes got a nice ass I guess they could say shes only 14 and that makes them happy. but if you think that ugly women is 14 you are sadly mistaken shes back ok well I sure miss my Jim Roam I liked that show but it is on the air in Austin oh well Austin is cool anyway even if there is no damn parking. I miss the old days of just driving around town and then thinking to myself  I go there and hey what do you know there is a parking spot or even a whole lot of parking spots. yea but then I would have to live in my boring ass town where there is nothing to do at all I mean take tonight for example Im going to watch a band play in pearland I would be sleeping but here Im going to start drinking a couple minutes in fact I will start drinking now oh no there is a man possessed by alcohol on the computer you must stop him he could easily kill some innocent family of 4 walking along and that would be very very unfortunate. ok whatever Im crazy no not really so I am just about done here according to the little clock in the bottom of the screen in the bottom of the screen cool Im going to party I quit bye  ,1
"Right now I'm a little bit depressed, not much has gone my way this week. I made some fabulous friends last week and we were all planning on going home together tomorrow, but now they seem not to want me to go with them. I don't know why everyone is getting mad all of the sudden, maybe it's something in the air. quite ridiculous, if you ask me. I have tears in my eyes as I'm typing, which is strange because I have tried so hard to not let little things get to me. My mom has always told me that I was overly sensitive, I thought I could overcome it, I think I can overcome anything. I had Mono a few years ago, and I overcame that one. My mind has not been forced to think in a while, people that I've talked to are just not to stimulating, I guess I should go and hang out in a coffee shop or something. I always thought college was going to be so much fun, and it's really not. I am this close to packing my bags and going home. Last week, I was the stereotypical college student and now, definitely not. My roommate and I are just not compatible, I mean she's a nice girl and all and she has good intentions, but I find her incredibly dull and childlike. She is a sophomore and I am a freshman. She has a really low self esteem and that's something that I don't deal well with, because I used to too. I don't like to think about those times, because I've overcome them. I fear that she is what I will become and it makes me resent her a bit. I don't want to live the life, or lack thereof, that she is leading. I make my life incredibly competitive, and I like to win. My cousin is down here, she rushed, she's actually in this class. But we've competed with each other all of our lives, whether the other one realized it or not, driving home, getting ready, meeting guys, they were all competitions. She and I are both incredibly stubborn too, so we butt heads quite often. I know that I've changed this year, and she has too, but we've changed differently. She's become more and more dependent on people, she can't be alone at all and I've become more and more independent of folks, for instance tonight, I walked over to the turtle pond and fed the fish, Carrie would freak out if someone told her to do that alone, but I really enjoyed myself tonight, I haven't felt that quiet peace in a long time down here. I don't know if UT is the right place for me, and I don't know. This is ridiculous. I'm here, and I'll graduate from here. Is this the sort of paper you're looking for? My mind is definitely not in a deep ponderous mood. This his how my mind works, worry after worry. I'd rather not get too far into myself here, if that's alright. On a happy note, I saw a guy in my Philosophy class today with absolutely Amazing hair. It was bleach blond and had four inch spikes! I admire people being gutsy enough to do that, never in my life would my hair be in spikes or fuchsia, I'll just stay the way I am. I miss my dog. I talked on the phone to my parents last night and I heard her bark in the background. I am ready to go home that's pretty much what has gotten me through this week. It has been the first time that I've gotten homesick. I think it's because I am going home tomorrow. Before, I didn't get homesick because I didn't allow myself to think about it too much, but I saw a Dallas Morning News today and got all choked up. What is all of this about anyway? Where do I benefit in the long run of living with someone I don't like and being forced to eat bad food? I'd much rather be in my own apartment. HA! My folks would really go for that one. They are so overprotective. The people that I was originally going home with are going to the Dave Matthews concert, and my mom won't let me go, I'm also not allowed to go to the TX v. OU game. That is stinky! I just need a good cry and a good nap and a hug from my grandma and everything will be fabulous again. I swear! If my roommate asks one more time if I want to talk about anything that's bothering me I will scream. I told her already that I'm writing a paper and she is still jabbering. Okay, Deep Breath. Back to Grandma. She is the cutest old lady in the entire world. She is definitely a cookiecutter grandma. It's fabulous. I told her I was coming home and she got so excited! My twenty minutes are up, but I feel much better now, I'm glad I got to take all of my emotion out on this essay rather than on my roommate! I don't know quite how to end my thoughts, even though I am 99. 99% sure that no one will ever read this. ",1
"     It's 11:30 and my roommates still aren't up. Do I like them?  Do I hate them?  It's goes back and forth. I'm sure they have their good qualities, but damnit - it's 11:30. I am now feeling the sensation of eye drops in my eye, and dripping down my cheek. I have pink eye - who gets pink eye except little kids?  I guess I do. Thinking, what am I thinking. I am hoping I do not gain weight at college!  Last night was fun, it's nice to meet new people even though some of them were scary!  I can't believe that guy got beat up!  I hope I don't fail out of college in my first semester. Rumor has it, at UT they give you the first full year - then it's tough luck. We'll see. Maybe my homesickness will vanish before it majorly appears if I  m home after a year. Home - I hate home. No I don't, I love it. But some of the people I had to escape. Andrew, I thought I loved him!  He loved me!  What the hell happened?  Why won't he try to talk to me?  I'm not a bad person - or am I?  Jesus, I tell you - I just don't have a plesant history with the men. I need to brush my teeth. The Raisin Bran was really nice though - I can still taste it. It doesn't taste as good when the morning breath is mixing with the flavor of such sweet cereal. I wonder what my brother is doing. What my friends are doing, what my parents are doing!  I hope everyone is OK. I hope my parents are doing well. I hope they're adjusting to having no kids at home. I really miss them, they're the best. I have to do well here for them. I wonder if they'd let me move back in with them. I could do housework or yardwork for room and board - sure, they'd like that. No work for them, just plesant little Beth home again. No, I'll do fine. It's up to me to do what I need to do. I wonder who's going to read this. I wonder what they'll think of me. I hope I don't have psychopathic tendencies!  That would be great - there's that girl Beth, PSYCHO!  Haha, I wonder if that's what people think of me now. ISn't it funny you can go through life and never know what another person is thinking?  I mean, sure, you can say you know - but the bottom line is you never really will. That's so crazy. Most of the time I don't even know what I'm thinking!  Wow, this world is really crazy. This assignment is making me philosophical. I kind of like it. Do I sound like a genius?  Oh, IMs are popping up. How nice it is to be able to speak to people over the internet. It's kind of sad though. I'd much rather talk on the phone - or would I?  I suppose it, like everything, has it's ups and downs. I wonder what Andrew is  doing now. If he's met a new girl. Or even if he's hooking up with my friends. Or should I say,   friends  . Craziness. You think you know a person. What am I talking about?  I knew him for four days. But he'd never had a history of being an ass. I wonder what'll happen when I go home. WIll anything?  Everything happens for a reason. I'll just keep believing that. I wonder what tests I'll get into for this class. I'm interested in the experiments. Hmmm. I am tired. I can't smell a damn thing. Or can I?  That smell of nothingness. Is that even something?  It has to be, otherwise it wouldn't be there. Yes, I am smelling nothingness. It's not too bad. It would be awesome if nothingness had a wonderful smell, like cherries, or fruit. But then I wouldn't appreciate the smell of those things otherwise, so I suppose nothingness is better. Wow, God was smart. He had it all planned out. I wonder if he's watching me now. I hope I'm not disappointing him. Sometimes I think I'm a disappointment. But, I'm not so bad I guess. My roommates are still sleeping. Who are these people?  Am I a bitch?  I can't help it - they're nothing like me. NOt that that's bad, but we share nothing in common. I wonder if they hate me. That would be funny. Another story to tell the kids. Crazy Beth and the roommates that hated her. I am so weird. I am so tired. I will go to the gym. I will lose weight so I will go home and be sexy and hot. No, I'm not doing it to go home, I'm doing it for me. I want to be confident. I wonder what it's like to be confident. My stomach is grumbling. Wow, along with smelling nothing, I am hearing nothing. Well, that's not true - aside from the clicking of the keyboard I am hearing something similiar to silence. Even though it's not silence - there are faint sounds of insects shirping and doing their things, but it's close to silence. Or is it?  I don't think I've ever heard, or experienced silence. You can't hear silence can you?  If a tree falls and no ones around to hear it, does it make a sound?  How the hell am I supposed to know?!  I would like to sit down and have a little chat with God one of these days. Maybe I should go to church more often. Well, maybe I should go to church period. But I've been before and it never answered my questions. It just made me wake up earlier. I used to be scared of Church. I think I was 10 years old and questioning my existence - is that healthy?  I know it made me different. Wow, I am an interesting person. I'm so suprised that I've typed to this extent. I hope all goes well and I get credit. I really like this psychology stuff. 500 people in a class - that's crazy. And I know no one. I will meet people. I can't imagine standing and talking in front of 500 people for an hour and a half. Jesus. I don't know if I could stand up for an hour and a half let alone talk that long. 20 seconds. That's all I have. Well, God Bless America. God Speed. ",1
"This is my first year at UT Austin, and I feel nervous and confused about what is to come. I am not accustomed to all this work and it is really making me worried because I cannot keep up in all my classes. For one, I have so much to do in all my classes, and two, I live off-campus and it takes at least an hour to get back to my apartment. My roommates a complete slob and he leaves his stuff everywhere around the house; just yesterday I notice he is been eating out of some fried chicken that was left over from last saturday and has been sitting out on the counter for 5 days!             I also want to keep up with my friends, but it is so hard because there is so much work. They're always asking me to go party with them on the weekends, but that is not something that I like to do. I don't drink and I don't plan on to and I am not interested in meeting girls because I am currently happy in my relationship. I've been going out with her for 10 months and one day. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me; sometimes I feel as if she cares for me then I care for myself. I've never felt like this before, specially with a member of the opposite sex. I don't have good looks to attract girls, but from what people tell me, I have a good personality. I listen to what others have to say. I listen to their problems and try to help them with their problems - I am not just saying this to suck up to a psychology professor, but I really do this. I am majoring in psychology; it is what I really want to do. Back to my girlfriend, she is currently going to UTSA and will be transferring to UT next year. What really bugs me though is how whenever I go to see her, my friends are always bugging me about Hey man, are you going to smash her?"" and my answer is ""NO. "" You can call me old-fashioned but I believe in abstinence. I am a virgin. It bugs others, but it doesn't bug me. I don't get how people can make love to multiple girls and not feel dirty about it. I know I would. I would never have sex with my girlfriend before we get married. I want to have that respect for her and just restrain myself from that. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love her. I want to make love to her, but I am not going to. I have morals. I was raised in a culture where dating was frowned upon. My parents had no problems with it as long as I didn't do anything - and I don't. I really like this girl, and I have thought of a future with her in the long run and I do not want to compromise that. I just wish that she would be here with me. As you can see, she means a lot to me and she is on my mind a lot. My major is psychology, but eventually I want to become a pediatrician or maybe even a psychiatrist - I don't know yet. It worries me that I will have to stay in school for another 8 years and that is a real long time but I feel that it is worth it, so I do not want to give up. I will try my best. Now I am sitting here not knowing how to word this paper because I am so accustomed to High School writing with 5 paragraphs and an introductory and conclusion, but the assignment was to simply state my feelings - so I am. It is raining outside right now. I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I have classes. It would not be fun walking drenched to philosophy 301 with Professor Bonevac. Philosophy also seems like an interesting class for me. Professor Bonevac is hilarious and is awesome to listen to (as you are). The rats with altered hypothalamuses were hilarious and they really made me think about all the technology that is out there. I know I am doing the right thing by taking all the classes I am to pursue my career. I am scared that my grades won't be able to cut it though. All these classes require a lot of reading, and reading isn't exactly my best subject. I am trying my best to keep up and continue with all the reading and continue with turning in my assignments on time. It is really hard but I think I should be all right. I am especially worried about this class, because the lectures are completely different from the textbook and I have to keep up on both and well - I am just a confused little man. My times running out and my brain is struggling to squeeze words out to finish up this assignment. I also have a chemistry exam tomorrow. YES tomorrow. So hopefully I'll do good at that because it seems relatively easy. I miss my parents. They are back in Houston. They don't want me to go visit them because they don't want me adding mileage to the car. So I am stuck in  Austin til Thanksgiving. I'll go home, eat turkey, and come back sick. Yes, I do listen in class. ",1
"Right now I am realizing how tired I am after such a long day of work. I worked all day today and I think I have sneezed at least 100 times. I wonder if I have allergies. My kitten is crawling across the keyboard. Man, do I type really slow or what. I probably won't be able to type very much in 20 minutes. I am really frustrated with by boyfriend right now. I think that must be a ""woman thing. "" I don't know. Maybe I am a little hard on him. I don't know. I just really wish he could be more open with me a communicate with me better. I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me. I don't know. I know he is not sure about us and I pray all the time that he will know how he feels about things and us, but so far that prayer is sill out there. I really don't know what to do now. I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With Stephen, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 8 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission. I am thankful that I am now in the remission that I have longed for and I think my doctor has found a successful dosage and mixture of medications that are helping keep me stable. God has answered so may prayers and is continuing to watch over me. Being sick has really opened my eyes to a lot and helped me grow so much as a person. I really have had to grow up dealing with such a horrible illness. Its really hard being 21 dealing with a chronic illness that you know there is no cure for and having to deal with it daily, either by pain or medications or doctors. I think I am down to taking about 17 pills a day now. I was taking about 25. Stephen said I would jiggle when I walked. I think I still do. My doctor is continuing to decrease my medications thankfully. Looking at the clock my time is up. Hope this doesn't bore you too much. Take care! ",1
"I ran out of the regular clothes I wear to school and all that was left in my closet were dresses. I'm also a bit upset because the guy I am interested in keeps giving me mixed signals and his emotions just run hot and cold. I feel that he may just be leading me on and it really hurts me because I really like him and I have felt this way for a while now. My friends tell me to just forget about him but easier said than done. And I'm afraid to say anything to him because I may just be making a fool of myself. But, I really hate to think about this because it just depresses me (a subject we just finished talking about today in class). I hope to learn more about it and maybe learn something about how to analyze his behavior with me. Aside from that and probably the biggest thing on my mind right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. I know tonight I will be up pretty late even though I have to be at school at 8am! I have forgotten how stressful school is. I guess lazing around all summer couldn't last forever. Oh well, it doesn't matter I actually like school and some of the pressures. It makes life interesting. Now, I'm wondering if my roommate will be home when I get there. She is a great person and I really like sharing an apartment with her this year. The only problem is that we goof around a lot together and don't get much done we decide to do homework in the same room. Good thing we have a 2 bedroom apt. Speaking of our apartment. I'm really hungry! My stomach was growling so much in class the guy next to me was looking at me funny. I just wish there were more hours in the day so I could get more things done. But, I guess everyone feels that way. As I write this I'm just glad I am at least getting one assignment out of the way. And I wish all of my assignment for all my classes were this easy. haha Well, I guess I am running out of things to say so it's a good things my twenty minutes are almost up. I'm just mad that I can't check my email because there is something wrong with my disk. I swear computers hate me. Now I won't know if my friend Raul wrote me back. I will buy an other disk tomorrow. great another expense. I need a job. ",1
"I just got done watching ""First Time Felon"" staring Omar Epps. I was very moving. I'm cooking stew right now on the stove. I learned how to cook it from my father. He taught me how this summer. Earlier today, I did this writing assignment and after completing it, I pressed clear instead of submit. That sure got me upset. Anyway, I went to class today and the lecture was funny. The phone is ringing right now. The phone is still ringing. There, someone finally picked up the phone. I have a lot of homework do to which are due this week and next week. And in two weeks I'll start having my first set of tests. They all fall on me at once. When I think about it, I don't want to study. But thinking back on last year, studying late nights wasn't really too bad. I kind of enjoy it. It was cool to walk across campus at three in the morning and see the stars out. I remember seeing the comet when it passed by last year. That was a really nice view. I wonder how the stew is doing. Hopefully it will taste as good as my father's. I see the letter that my friend sent me form the county jail. I really miss him. He was like a brother to me. We always looked out for each other. I'm really good friends with his brother too. He is a good church-going person. Faithfully believes in God. Well, I haven't talked to either of them for some time now. Maybe I'll give him a call tomorrow if I have time. My girlfriend paged me, but didn't leave a number down. It was just a message. I really miss her. She is back in Houston. Her birthday is coming up on the 26th and she wants to come up to visit for the weekend. The problem is that I have a test on that day, and some other tests that following week. I wish I could take the tests some other time. Oh, well. That's life for you. My brother landed an internship with IBM, but hasn't started work yet. I wonder when he will start. His future looks bright for him. I can hear the T. V. downstairs. Some cartoon show is playing right now. My roommates are downstairs watching it. I can see my keys from where I'm sitting. They are attached to the Pekkle key chain my girlfriend gave me. Actually I have two key chains. The other one is of Jesus. A total stranger gave it to me one day and I've never seen him since. I like to think that it was Jesus himself, giving me strength when I needed it the most last year. I was feeling down and out last year. I was sitting by myself in a coffee shop and in comes this man. He walks up to me and gives me the key chain. He tells me that Jesus will never turn his back on me. So every time I look at the key chain, I think of Him and it gives me strength. School is finally underway now. I hope that I do good this year. Anyway, the 20 mins are up. Hopefully I'm doing this right. I know that this isn't even for a grade, but I just worry a lot. Speaking about worrying, I'm worried that my phone bill isn't too high because I've been calling back to Houston everyday. ",1
"This is my stream of consciousness writing for psychology class. I'm going to use periods and capitalize out of habit O. K. I had a dream two nights ago and I was at some Hollywood awards ceremony. This lady introduced me to kirstie Allie as I was sitting at a table. I looked over, and it was not Kirstie Allie but Andie Mcdowell, some other actress. Anyway, it was weird. Then on the very next night after that dream, I was watching a movie on T. V. and she was in it. I rarely see her on T. V. and I was astonished. It is very relevant, because I am reading a book right now called the Celestine Prophecy. This book is very cool. It talks about some ancient manuscript found in Peru that is going to change every human beings consciousness. It is very involved, but the first insight in this manuscript says that at the end of the 20th century people are going to become more and more aware of these coincidences. It is amazing because I have been having many of these lately such as that dream. Also, on the way over here  I turned on my car, and I thought of this song by Jewel. I turned the station and that song was on the radio. Unbelievable, right?  I don't think so, man,/. this kind of thing happens to me all the time. Ok I finished a focus question for history class before I came here and I also watched Seinfeld. It was the one where Jerry picks up a deaf lineswoman at a tennis match. George makes a mess of himself with an ice-cream sundae and they get it on T. V. Georges girlfriend breaks up with him and he doesn't know why then Kramer tells George alright I'm not gonna sit here and talk about Seinfeld for 20 minutes. I am so happy like not really just kidding alright wrong here we go alright You are all just a bunch of hacks. Lets get ready to rumble in the Bronx Joy boy girl swirl pearl grapes of wrath. Nietzche's theory on Dionysus man Let's call ourselves the Doors man. Like the doors in your mind, acid. Aldous Huxley. When the doors of perception are cleansed, we will see things as they truly are, immaculate. That was a line from Oliver stones, The Doors good flick. It is total irony how Jim Morrison has a poem where he says, Did you have a good life when you died, Enough to base the movie on. He must have known they would make a movie about him. Strange days. I'm taking Tai Chi classes. That should be very beneficial to me. I must do well in school this semester. Man that is a big deal to me Wow I'm really looking forward to the UCLA football game. It should be a good one. I really want a piece of glass you  know. My grandmother died last week on the same night Princess Diana  died. Was that some kind of luck, or what. I want to die at a reasonable age. Death, now there's something I could talk about Nope let's see Mi hermano no va a California para la funeral. Neither am I. Is that wrong, I don't think so. Man let's just increase the peace I can't believe I just said that There is a reason to live. We are all one consciousness functioning at different levels on the same paralysis of unending consequences of our reaction to the global warming issue in South America for the love of Peirre. They are going to read my thing and go nuts man. Who am I talking to. Sometimes when I'm sitting alone I think as if someone were with me. This is a good thing, for the love of my family is always going to be there. ",1
"Last week I took a Chinese Clep test. It started out very well, I understood everything that the recorder played and was able to answer all the questions. As you know, the Cantonese language is written in two different formats. One way, the tradition way, was the one I learned since I was a little kid. The other format was a newer, I believe it originated in Hong Kong or something, was much like the original except more scribbled-looking"". Anyways, I opened the next section of that test and it all looked like scribbling to me. So I spent most of the remainder of time sifting through and guessing at words. Then, I decided to just skip through to the end. That is when I figured out that the back part of the test was the traditional format. ""Damn it!"" was the first words that rushed through my mind, along with a whole stream of foul consciousness. But of course, that was last week, and I already have my results back from the test. I believe I did relatively well. Relative to my usual grades in my classes and tests. Today, Monday, is the first day I have been to my RLM Biology discussion, thus making the actual first full week of school. I must say, I am completely exhausted. Biology discussion was quite an episode. We had an TA that had a really really bad accent. Much worse, he tried to give an oral review, and when he asked questions, everyone in the class stared at him blankly. Some ventured a guess softly, but the entire process took most of the discussion period. Then we took a quiz, which I found to be a bit difficult because I didn't understand teh oral review. I had to buy books today. Spent a whopping 129 dollars just on two stupid books that I probably won't be needing much. I could have found many many other uses for that 129, but this is college, land of the rich and prosperous, haha. Geez, look at my grammar in this essay, I think my english teacher would have a heart attack. Psych class was pretty interesting today. Dr. Pennebaker brought in a polygraph for demonstration in the class. I was completely fascinated by the experiment. Too bad I can't say the same for my Philosophy class. Its not a boring class, its just that he is got this very very soft weird voice, almost commanding me to fall into deep sleep. And so I obeyed. I notice that when I'm sleeping in class, my body still attempts to take notes while my brain is on standby. But of course, I wake up to find a whole lot of scribbling on my paper that does not make any sense whatsoever. You can definitely tell at what point in the lecture I crashed. The funniest part is, I lent my notes out to a friend that just got into the class, wishing him good luck. I think since I have been here at UT for the fall, I have become more stressed about little things and uncaring about other things that should be worried about. I have been wondering about how my friends have been doing, wherever they went. I worry about other stupid things that I feel the need not to bring up at this moment. However, I have not been worrying enough about schoolwork. I have been recreating too much. This weekend though, we went to Barton Springs to see a friend that came up to visit us from UTSA. Barton Springs was nothing like I had imagined. I absolutely loved it. Everything except the coldass water. Then on the trip back, with the windows rolled down and the wind in my face, it felt so good. It felt like summer again. Of course, I had enrolled in the UT Summer program. A little bit of work, but a lot less crowd. I miss summer. ",1
"I really don't know which house I liked best. The first one was alright but I don't know if I would like living in a duplex. What if they are annoying or out of control? I liked the second house a lot more. It was huge and nicely kept but it was a little pricey. We would definately need at least like 7-8 people to live with us to bring down the price. It'd be cool if Emily and Singer would live with us but I don't know if their parents would like the idea of them living with guys. It would definately hook us up for meeting girls and what not. Better parties for sure. I'm so tired, getting up early for that stupid ticket drawing that got sold out really sucked. And now we don't even have tickets so we woke up early for nothing. I have so much reading to do in all my classes but I know i'll be fine. I need to call kathy back too. I wish she could have stayed up here longer but that's not possible so there's no reason to dwell on it. I wish i had more time to take a nap before our next meeting with the other realtor. But i am pretty excited to see some more houses. Supposedly there's a nice one across from the frat which would be ideal. We need one close to campus too because i don't know if i can afford a car next year. I'm going to have to find myself a big paying job this summer. Damn my head is killing me. I really should try to take a nap. I'm really pissed about my phone. I don't understand how a top of the line phone can lose its battery in 10 minutes of use when it's supposed to have 4. 5 hrs worth of talk time. If this new battery doesnt work im going to lose it. I don't have the patience to be dealing with this crap. I need to take a shower before i leave tonite because there won't be any time before the party i don't think. Why does my room not get any cooler. I'm sweating and im just sitting here typing. I have a horrible taste in my mouth, i should go brush my teeth or rinse my mouth with listerine. How have only 9. 5 minutes passed. I'm starting to get a little tired here. I really didnt like that first realtor. He kept rushing us and stuff and he just seemed annoying. But if he has the house we want i won't deny him the business. My blisters finally healed so wearing those boots won't kill me anymore. My cold is starting to go away too which is good. I hope Emily is taking good notes in chem because i just couldnt make it today. Way too tired. Whatever i'll give her a call when class is over and see how things went. It's not a bad class its just really basic and easy stuff right now that i remember from high school. Plus it is a pretty long walk. Ok 8 minutes to go, not too bad. I'm pretty hungry now that i think about it. I would love some spicy wings from pluckers. But i have to cut down on expenses so there goes that thought. Casey was hilarious today when we were trying to get donations for charity. I couldnt stop laughing. That was fun. I need to get my plane ticket for winter break. They are so damn expensive even though it's so far away. I should do that today or tomorrow so that they don't get any worse. OK 5 more minutes it's almost over. My fingers are starting to cramp up a bit. And my hunger keeps growing so i hope these minutes go by fast. I hope everyone still takes the bus to dallas for the game because at leat that will be fun. Rima said we may be able to stay in her when we go so that would be a sweet deal too. Craig just got out of the shower. I need to take one too. I need to do some laundry as well soon becaus my basket is starting to fill up. I got to find someone to do it with so its not so boring. OK im too hungry i need something to eat now. Twenty minutes is definately longer than i thought but i guess it is almost over. About 1 minute to go. . nice. Josh got some really cool things to hang in our room today. Definately gives the room some more character. 30 seconds left. 20 seconds left. 10 seconds. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 bye  ",1
"I don't really want to do this assignment, I think it's tedious and I want to go to sleep. I haven't had much rest lately, but socializing with my friends is important to me too. I want to study, but I'm totally lost at what I want to do because I have so much work to do. I think I will study psychology first before I study my EE book. I miss my brother, he's so cool. Looking around the room, it feels full, but empty at the same time. This music in the background is cool, I'm glad I burned the cd today. I hope my dorm mates don't get mad that I'm turning it up so loud. I don't really care that much though. I want to go do something besides work. Everyone around here is studying, but I am not. I feel like I'm forgetting to study for something. I wish I went to see that movie last night, It sounded really cool. My neighbors are great, but I don't know if their real or fakes. i am so cynical. I don't understand why I don't trust anyone. I wish I could trust people more, but I think I trust too much already. I don't know. I think I'm going to call an old friend today, see if he wants to do something. Houston seems so far away from here, I miss my family. I don't understand why people don't miss their family here, I seem to be the only one. I try to call them everyday, but it seems like the telephone conversations isn't enough. I want them to be near me. The houses around here look really beat up and old, maybe they should live a little farther away. The concert I went to was pretty cool. i had a good time. It was strange, off all the concerts I went to, this one had a lot of good looking girls. It must be the type of music it is. I wish my taste in music was more targeted to good looking girls. But, I hate the music those girls listen to, it's so bad. I don't understand how they can listen to such garbage. Man, my trash can is full, when I'm done I think I'll throw out the trash. Why do people keep leaving garbage in here, it's not just us. I hope that my computer doesn't crash again. It's built well, but I seem to be slacking off on computer studying. I don't know as much as I did or wish to. I love computers so much though. I wish I could be rich like those million or billionaires. But, then again, I don't want to be too greedy, maybe if I could just provide enough for my family. I think I wouldn't like to be rich, maybe just comfortable and liking what I do. I hope EE is what I like to do, my decision making ability is really putrid. I don't think I like writing this. My hands are getting kinda strained. I think I'm going to go and throw away the trash, oh wait, I still have another assignment to do, wow, I'm glad I remembered to do this assignment, I don't want a bad grade only 4 weeks into the school year. Okay, I think I want to finish this up. Thank you for listening to my psycho-babble, I hope it benefits you more than it ever did for me. okay. I think ill stop now. bye. ",1
"Why is'nt my roomate quieter doesn't he undersatnd that I'm working on a homework assignment, I never really seems to care what I'm doing he just goes on even if it hinders what I'm doing he pushes an awful lot too. I don't know if I can handle another semester with him, I wish I wasn't as nice and well behaved and just told him bluntly and straight to his face that he was bothering me, I miss my girlfriend she's the only one that seems to understand how I feel even though she claims she has a hard time reading me she always seem to know the right things to say and do to cheer me up even in the worst of moods,, why do the simplest things that my roommate do bother me so much, I wish he would just understand that I want to try to go to bed at a decent time even when he isn't tired he doesn't have to go to bed just respect the fact that I'm tired and need some quiet my girl friend always knows when to leave me alone and let me have my space. why do major things that are poletial problems not bother me such as the possibility of failing a test or a bank possibly screwing me over, a bank can take in thousands of dollars a day but have the indecentcy to charge $3 for a money order in a bank that I'm a member to even the employees think it's outragious, twenty miutes doesn't usually seem like a long ammount of time but when your continuously writing for that time period it seems much longer. homework seems a lot worse then it is I don't mind homework when I'm actually doing it it just when I start it off but more when I stop and come back to it after have a good time. i wish I were stronger than I am socially, if I were more out going but then I wouldn't be who I am now and my friends wouldn't be who they are and I wouldn't have my girl friend who seem to be the center point of me retaining any strength and going on.

"don't take waste a minute you have to have no worries. spending time with people you love and have fun with is what makes those great memories that you look back on. right now I should be living life to it's fullest ( I should always actually) because things only get more and more complicated. sometimes I feel so confused and it gets me down, but the weird thing is, is that I can't pinpoint what I'm confused about. that's bad for me because then I can't talk to anyone about it--that's what usually helps me get things off my mind. I am going home this weekend to see my brother from l. a. California and he is bringing his new girlfriend. I'm anxious to meet her because she sounds so sweet. I wonder if this is the girl he will marry--I always think of that when a relationship begins. I truly believe that a couple should go out at least one year and a half before they think of marriage--it takes a long time to see all of the other's weakness, and characteristics. it is way too hot for me--it drains me so much. I dropped history because I had a really bad feeling about it--the teacher was on a different level than I was and I could not learn from her. I feel a bit weird and guilty for dropping it because I usually stick things out no matter what, but I need to do well this semester so I had to make sure. I really want to go tubing, or hiking or something outdoors every weekend. being outdoors really relieves the stress in me and I am automatically happy. I miss my dog. some people just don't like to get up and do something. they sit there and think about how much energy it is going to take to do something (such as go tubing) and think about how long it is going take to drive there/  rather than just getting up and doing it!  I need to do things that I think of and when I want. no better time than the present. I hate nightmares. they've been sticking in my head lately all day after I wake up. they seem to  be getting stronger and stronger. I dream about sad or fearful things all of the time. exercise is so important for me ( not to lose weight etc)  it seems to keep me happy and feeling good. it's not a chore for me to exercising. what should I write about. I think I want to go sky diving but I seem to be getting more and more fearful of things. more nightmare--fear of animals getting me. I don't want to be a baby about that sort of stuff because I don't want to miss out on anything. I want to do so much outdoors but it makes it hard when I am so scared of animals. I used to be a tomboy and play with worms and bugs etc but it's a different story now. kids also make me happy. they are full of innocence and curiosity. I could sit there and just watch kids all day. I miss soccer and art from when I was in high school. those are things I enjoyed. I decided that I am going to play intramural soccer here. I hope I have fun in it. I want to do tile paintings when I get older. my mother is so sweet, people seem to take advantage of the nicest people in the world. my brother always gets his heart broken because he is so nice. I want to find him the perfect girl because that's what he deserves!  I love and miss my family so much. we have always been so close and everyone can see it. it's a weird close because we don't show our love to  each other all of the time but we are very very protective over each other and interested in helping every one out. there's five kids. big families can be difficult but there are so many good things about it too!

"Today. Had to turn the music down. Today I went to the KVRX meeting. I  will hopefully have my own radio show. I dont know what I will talk about. I have considered in great depth and. Jeez this songs starts off quietly. cool beginning. should start louder. oh well can't all be perfect. My roommate is playing the same game . he plays that game too much and spends too much time with it. does he get homework?  I just don't know. This song is rather erotic. in a very deep and disturbing way. I can't decide whether I actually want to study medical technology or not. I love many things form chemistry to mycology to religious studies/. speaking  of which I had a very good time at my PSA meeting. Pagan student alliance. ahh. gotta love that screech the chairs let when you push them back. ahhhhh. well. oh yeah at the meeting I met several people. Caleb seems rather worried about one of the women. though he is bound and like wise I am unable  to speak ill of her. Well I am in charge of running our booth Monday. or is it Tuesday. That song is one again. his team (my roommate) I s winning. YEESH. Well I guess if he enjoys it. my typing is rather poor and this assignment is taking a long time. 20 minutes. been 5. . lalalalalalalal. Yes the meeting. I talked about shamanism. which apparently comes from a Siberian word. being that there are several hundred different shamanic following in this world. due to the vast number of tribes that speckle our world. Peter Steele has a very sexy voice. I would love to make love to this song,. Well. too much. info. /. Dtos are fun ellipses. that word too is fun. I think that perhaps I am slowly running out of things to say. . That song reminds me of my young age. riding in the car and talking to my  family. the streetlights were bright back then and things were happy. or where they. perhaps not,, I don't remember that well. My car was full of all of us and the  dog wasn't around. She isn't anymore either. epilepsy has taken her from this incarnation. I wonder what she is  doing now. Does she know that I miss her???? I  wish I could find out. Possibly clairvoyance. That is of course under the assumption that spirits are all equal. they are. I know. For I am. Yes I was and shall be. ever. My childhood bears a interesting mark of past fuzziness. I can't seem to recollect exact details like others. very brown. ,. fuzzy is the best word. The 80's really did suck. I wonder why that CD is still lying there on the answering machine. I love bright circling colors. they interest me. not in a psychotic manner but in a very hypnotic manner. they calm. I like to be calm and sedate/. Though activity on occasion is good. . . . Grey is not a good color. neutral  yes but very passive. though passive is good. Taoism. there's a philosophy. They believe that by doing nothing they do everything. interesting. I am currently reading Aleister Crowley His hermetic order seems rather interesting though a bit on the abnormal and almost eccentric side. I remember reading stories about spiders. And milkmen in fields with roses. no daisies. yeah daisies. Looking down upon the daisies as they look up to me. I want to do a past life regression and find out who I was. I wonder if I have been anyone famous or popular. Wow I am saying some rather strange things. interesting. I didn't. . My head hurts. and my room is hot. I would like to stop this. I have 3 minutes left and nothing to say except for watching my fingers press the buttons is a rather enjoyable activity. they press slowly and heavy. sometimes fast and lithe. I mean light. yeah light. so I hope I am doing this right. I am putting my consciousness on record for others to read. I guess that's cool. It should be interesting though I have said very little. I wonder what other are saying. ahh the three minutes have passed and my typing ill now slow to a halt. ",1
"For some odd reason, I felt really cold all day long. Whether I was in my room or just walking around campus, my insides felt really cold and hollow. Maybe it is due to the fact that I had to come back today. All weekend long I was at home in Round Rock. The thought of having to come back really annoyed and made me nervous for no particular reason. Sometimes I get in this really dark mood and I imagine myself attending all these funerals, and all I can see is black and empty space. I wonder why I feel this way sometimes, but I always come out of this zone and cannot even remember what triggered me to have these images or feelings. Whenever I get this way, all I see is the vision of someone dying or screaming in pain from something so horrible that cannot be explained. Once, I had this dream and I witnessed what seemed like the end of the earth; I came face to face with celebrities that only I dreamed of meeting, and when someone would die, their name and accomplishments in life would be announced on an intercom. You see everyone was captured in this underground tunnel type of cave and we were all waiting for the tide to come in and take us away. As soon as I heard my name, birth date, and my few accomplishments in life, I could taste the saltwater in my mouth and that is when I woke up crying and all wet from sweat. I was really scared and curious to why I had such a dream, but I could never really comprehend what really happened, nor could my friends. Some of my friends gave me back some interesting feedback, but the majority of them thought I was definitely insane. But after that weird experience, I have not had another experience like that one. The cool thing is that one of my good friends was doing an interview the next day on weird things that people experience and she interviewed me. My quote "" I witnessed the end of the world"", was in the school paper. Some of her friends on the staff wanted to talk to me about my dream, but I figured since they heard everything I had to say in the paper, there was no reason for me to elaborate any further. Another weird encounter I have had with near death was that in my dream, I was at my mother's funeral. The weird thing was that her death was due to cancer. Well that seemed kind of odd because there was never any talk about my mother ever being sick. Well in my dream, I felt so alone and cried out to her and became hysterical. I couldn't help myself. When I woke up from the dream, I was crying and I was covered all over with sweat. Those two dreams are the only serious ones I've come upon. But I wonder why I have such dreams; could it be a result of my odd days when I feel dark and hollow, or is it caused by some stress factor experienced during the day sometime. I have heard that people have weird dreams when they can't sort out all their problems during the day. I am really interested in why people have odd dreams and would like to further study the factors as well as reasons that cause these events. Whenever I have a dream, I hate the fact how I can never remember the following day, even though it's what wakes me up. Why is it that one can have a dream and after he awakens, he can no longer remember what or who was in it. I would really like to study the causes of our dreams and the reasons why we become so disturbed, yet can remember nothing. It would be interesting if someone did an experiment on students as a project; to detect and understand maybe the basis for having dreams. ",1
"     Well, I woke up this morning scared because I was dreaming! I think I was dreaming that I was being chased by somebody and I was running like hell!  My roommate Kate woke me up because we were a little bit late to school and I jumped out of bed like I was on fire! I scared her just getting out of bed!! hahahaha! It was pretty funny, I guess!! Wow, it is a BEAUTIFUL day outside!  It's all cloudy and I hope it rains all weekend. The news said it would but I really hope they are right!! So, there's this guy that just got up and left. He looked maybe familiar but maybe not! He was wearing a red shirt and he looked kind of silly! Hahahahaha!!  Now this other girl just sat down to use the computer and she looks a little bit irritated!  I might be wrong but she's hitting the keys like she wants to kill!! I don't know. maybe she just type's hard. or something!! OH Yeah!  I had a good time in my math class today. I actually learned something!! It was pretty cool! You know, I come from a really tiny place outside of El Paso called Fabens. This place is huge for me!! It's like this whole library is the size of my town. All the people in it too. My town is tiny and there are a thousand people here!!! It's so crazy to come from a town that the population is the size of a full library! That's tiny compared to this place!  Along with all this walking in and out, I've never seen so many people get together at once and if I have, it was at my 600 student high school!! These 600 students were all four grades put together!  That makes me laugh because I feel like an ant here!! But that's ok. I will grow to be a big UT Longhorn!! Woo! Hoo!!  So,  I miss my little sister. She's 9 years old and I was like her second mommy. My older sister attends UT and she's been here for a while now! Back at home, It was only both my parents and my little sister and I !  When my parents went out I would have to take care of her and I practically did that all nine years of her life. practically!!! haahhahaha!! We all went out a lot so we left her with my grandmother or my aunt at times!! She was who I always came home to to play with!! She always wanted me to play with her and most of the time I did!! I would try to take her to all of my games in sports and all of my track meets!  She really loved to see me play!! She always wanted to play with my team and after every game . ""Cyndi, When I grow up, I'm going to play Basketball too, or volleyball and I'm also going to run track and throw the discus. Just like you!"" Awwww. My baby wants to be just like me!! I think she's the one I miss the most because I grew up with her and she grew up with me!! WoW! She's so big now!! I can still remember when she was just a little baby!! Awww. my little baby! Oh yeah. and her name is Joyce Lynn just in case you wanted to know!  She's a very smart girl and I can't wait until she grows up!! She already knows what she wants to be. a Marine Biologist!! Can you believe it?!! She told me that!!! :-) ",1
"How revealing am I supposed to be in this assignment? I can never track my thoughts. They always flit around. I am trying to think of something brilliant to write so I won't appear to be a complete imbecile. I just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. What am I thinking. I think I need to do well in college. Is my studying enough? I mean really. I am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but I feel as if I have a reasonable grasp on what I am learning. How much of an expert am I supposed to leave each class. Chemistry is going to kick my ass. I need to try harder. Why can't I get it. My sat scores are so high but I can't imagine why. I'm supposed to be smarter. Smarter than I am. Smarter than your average Joe. When I talk I am impressive. People applaud me and remark about me as if I'm brilliant. I'm not. I'm just good at bullshit. I think I want to marry my boyfriend. He doesn't treat me well. But I am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. Does that justify the way he treats me? I cannot afford to think about him all the time. He will cause me to fail. Or so my mom says. The minute I think of her saying not to think about him I do. How can I not. I didn't do this on my word processor first. I mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if I just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. My typos are me. I make mistakes. I misspell. Rarely of course. I am thinking nothing right now. I wonder if other people do that. Think of nothing. I think of a blank canvas. Is that nothing? I guess not but I believe you can understand what I am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and I have spent together? My bed is too small. I want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. Hmmmm. I am so deliciously tired right now. You know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. Will is annoying me. He has this dumb ass book he will not put down. I hate competing for his attention. Asshole. Oh yeah Will is my boyfriend. I forgot to mention my honey's name. Back to my tired. I just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. It is not really body fatigue. I just want to to go into my cocoon. Something nonacademic. Something cozy. It is mental and social fatigue which I suffer from. Six more minutes. I need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. Oh yeah. You can bet I checked the spelling on that one. Today I was called the ""s"" word by another black person. Sellout. Will is white. Black people hate that. DO you know that in my entire life I have never had a true black friend. The black girls seem to hate me. They think that I am a snob. The black guys listen to the black girls. And I listen to my heart. I love Will. I worry about him. Being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. It makes him black and he does not get that yet. When he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. Then he will leave me. It's all a matter of time. Why would someone like him want someone like me. Why would someone like me want someone like him. He does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. Guess what its' been? 20 minutes.

"Ok, so I guess I am just going to start writing about anything. Today has been a busy day, I got a lot of things done that I needed to so that is kind of a relief. I am really stressed out right now so I am trying to organize what I need to get done in my head. I finally get to move into my new home tomorrow after class. I have been homeless for the past month. The past few weeks I've been staying with friends but it really sucks not having a place of your own. I feel really disorganized right now and I hate to start the school year out that way. The next few days are going to be busy moving in. I got UT vs. OU tickets today. That's one thing I don't have to worry about anymore. But now I need to get that trip organized. Casey, Karoly, Austin, and C. J. have all committed. I need at least one more person to commit so the hotel room won't be too expensive. That shouldn't be hard though so I am not going to think about that now. I really want to go running right now but it's the middle of the day and really hot. I think I might go anyways. Then I'll come back and shower, pick up Casey from class at 5:40, and start getting ready to go out. The band we're going to see starts at 8. That is going to start the night out early. But, I guess that is a good thing because then it will end early, which means more sleep before class in the morning. I am listening to some music right now that makes me want to dance! What sucks is that I can't dance though. I wonder why God gives some people rhythm and some not. I hate not having rhythm because I love music. People say that everyone can dance, just do it, but I am proof that that is not true. Oh well. I need to get over that. My neck hurts, I guess I slept on it wrong. I hate it when I have a crick in my neck. I really feel like running today. I wonder why. Running dancing where is all this energy coming from? I haven't gotten much sleep in the past couple days. I think my body does better when I don't get as much sleep. When I sleep late I feel depressed that I wasted part of the day and I am still tired. Today I woke up early and I feel productive. Let's see what all I did. I went early and tried to draw football tickets. They told me to come back later so I went back to my friend's place and called my mom. I made a dentist appointment which is long overdue, drove to my storage place and paid a bill, found out I could move in tomorrow at 3:00, bought a few CDs I've been wanting, went out to eat for lunch, and then went and got the football tickets. Now I am doing some homework. Next I am going to run, hopefully not die of a heat stroke, then tonight I have a ticket to see a band play I have been wanting to see. That will be fun. I thought about taking a nap but it doesn't look like that is going to happen. I guess I'll just have a couple cups of coffee before I start drinking some beers. Well, it looks like my time is up. This assignment reminds me of my emails to my friends. I just sit down and type whatever comes out and they end up being really long, boring, and pointless. Kind of nice I get to do it for a grade and not annoy my friends. Peace out. ",1

"Sitting to write this assignment, I feel I have lots of other things to think about. When will I find time to get everything done? I still need to unpack boxes, get things organized. The days pass, and more is left unfinished. I thought I was off to a good start, but I need to find a way to organize myself so that I can meet daily goals, weekly goals, and monthly goals. My problem with procrastination is always adding unnecessary stress to my life, and if I could only stay on top of things, or work a little more each day, I would feel less stressed, with a better sense of accomplishment. What do I want to get done? I want to finish unpacking, decorate my room  that requires that tickytacky stuff, since nothing sticks on these stupid walls. Need to find more little pillows, and little desk and drawer organizers. Little stuff like that. I need to organize my pictures, decide which I want to hang up, which are best in frames, where I will display all my frames. I also have to decide which stuff I really don't need, and pack that up, and ship it home to California. I need to organize my school stuff, still buy my aerobic book, and the right edition of the Odyssey for that freshman seminar, plus get some three ring binders. I know I brought some, but have no idea where they are at the moment. It seems impossible to loose something in such a small space, but I've managed to do it quite a few times. I need to balance my checkbook, pay my cell phone bill, and call my bank about my debit card that is not working. Did I not activate it right? I know I have enough money in the bank. I don't understand what the problem is. I have to remember to get cash; I have borrowed money too much from people in the past couple of day, not because I was out of money, but because I kept forgetting to figure out the problem. Until I do, I can't get money out of the ATM machine, I'd have to go down to the bank, and get money out, or write a check for cash, or something. Still trying to figure out all this bank stuff. I wonder if that cell phone bill is right. There seem to be some unnecessary charges on it, or ones I didn't know about. Why is my mom not calling me back? I know they are busy with soccer stuff, but I left a message saying I needed to talk, and asked those questions on the answering machine, you would think she would call back immediately. Especially since she expressed so much concern recently when she didn't hear from me in only a couple days. I need to get on top of my reading, and studying. Want to find a better place to study than my room. Too many distractions, my computer, my music, my phone, my ongoing room decorating project, unpacking, the TV, email, the neighbors, the stupid smoke detector, that is low on batteries, and is constantly, constantly beeping, relentlessly. And the person on the floor above us who never stops banging on the floor, it is so annoying, between the beeping, and banging, they are enough to drive my absolutely insane. I went to the point of stuffing cotton in my ears last night to try and block out the high pitched beeping, it is so shrill, it's painful, especially terrible when you're trying to sleep. My roommate doesn't seem to mind, she can block out almost anything. I don't know how she devotes so much time to studying. I wish I could be more disciplined like that. I would be much happier with myself. But, I am having so much fun. Will study later tonight at Barnes and Noble's with Amy. We'll see how that place is for studying. It's hard not having my car, although most people have theirs. It's nice not to be the responsible driver, and to have to pay for gas parking, or worry about getting lost, the ridiculous one way streets, and no road signs hardly to help you out, but still at times it would be much easier if I had it here. Next year, I will but what car will I have? What are my parents going to decide about that? What about molly? What will she drive? Will I get my prelude? Will that be too hard on my parents? How are they handling sorority costs? Should I get a job soon, to help with all that? How are my bills going to be this month? I'm sure the long distance bill on my regular phone line will be out of control. Try to use my cell phone more, free long distance, but not sure exactly how long I have the extra minutes for. Will john go by my parents' house tonight and set up his ticket? It makes me really nervous, not quite sure why. I know he want to come, and I know he's planning on it, but I want to see him so bad, and miss him so much, I don't want to get my hopes up too high, in case things don't work out. How will things be when he comes, how will be people like him?. Will they be accepting of him? What about the whole tattoo thing and the way he dresses? I want him to bring all his long sleeved shirts and nice clothes, but I do not not want him to change for anyone, nor do I want him to change. I love him exactly the way he is, and wish there were more people like that here, but I don't want him to be uncomfortable, or other people to judge him or make him feel uncomfortable. I want everyone to like him and for him to have a good experience. Even though I know he's not coming to go to a bunch of parties, or meet a bunch of people, he'll be here to spend time with me, but I still want to take him out, take him to the game, show him how big and fun, and cool the parties are here. Definitely won't be going to any SigEp functions, I know how they are about outsider guys, especially someone like john. I could never be embarrassed of him, but it might be uncomfortable, especially if any guys give him a hard time, and then I'll feel like I brought someone who wasn't supposed to be there, like with Sean the other day. That was a really bad experience. I don't want anyone to make john feel that way. Having a car would be nice for when he comes, could pick him up from the airport, take him to cool places, the oasis, the lake, mt. whatever where the Zeta girls ate tonight. There are so many pretty, cool things, three days is not nearly enough. But, the time will be spent well, and will either make it easier than waiting until thanksgiving to see him, or make it harder, because he'll be fresh in my mind. They say out of sight, out of mind, and I believe that to be very true. Same went for mike. But, the longer I'm away, the less I think about john, and the less I truly miss him. I think the same goes for him. It doesn't seem as urgent for him to see me the way that it was when I first was here. But of course that should be expected and it was. I don't like the way some things are here. I want to get out and meet some different kinds of people, or meet nonfrat type boys, because I'm not liking the conservative style that much. It's not what I 'm used to. I definitely don't like how money and status are such an issue. It's ridiculous, it reminds me of the movies. I didn't think people like that really existed. I left California thinking I was getting away from all the selfabsorbed, selfimage, stuff, that I was really growing sick of, only to come somewhere and feel as though I'm surrounded by an even worse kind of snobbery, based on money, family name, status, having not really anything to do with how good looking you are, as is the California snob, but how much money your dad makes, or what kind of car you drive, or whether or not you buy an $800 shirt to wear to a frat party. It's all very ridiculous to me, and it makes me sad, and homesick for a place where it's really cool to be laid back and extremely casual all the time, and where you're not judged by how much money you have. I do love how the boys always hold open doors for you, and pay for everything; those are aspects I do very much enjoy. I would not want to raise my kids here, I'm not even sure now if I want to live here after college. I love a lot of things about it, and I 'm having so much fun, meeting lots of wonderful girls, the guys are a problem for me. I went to college thinking that it's funny knowing this is probably the place where I'll meet my husband. I highly doubt it at this point in time. I'd have to find a diamond in the ruff, like Becca did. It makes me miss john, Karl, Daniel, Jordan, Ryan, even so much more. It makes me miss all my guy friends, and the fun and comfort of guys who are not polite, but funny and perverted, to a certain point of course. I can't wait to see john, I wonder how things will be. I've decided to tell him how I really feel, knowing his reaction will probably not be to admit he feels the same way. I think he probably has an idea of the way I feel, I've probably hinted at it before. I do have a glimmer of hope, since he's been signing his letters with the word love, and wrote, ""love, john on the picture he drew, and he is spending at least $300 to come out and see me, which unlike all the stupid rich boys here is money that he has worked his butt off to make, doing countless hours of work, and now is throwing it all into a three day trip. It really is incredible to me. It touches me to think he would do something like that for me. I wonder what Daniel and Karl think about that, especially Daniel. What about Jordan, I wonder if mike will find out. What will he think about that? He once said, regarding the necklace and earrings from Daniel, that he would never spend that much money on a girl ever. Well, he knows john never ever has any money, never has a steady job, and mooches off of everyone else. How would he feel if he heard that john was spending every penny he had to come and see me? Maybe then he would open his eyes a little. Probably not though. I hope someone will be willing to pick john up from the airport, I know Candace won't want to miss any of her classes, for him of course I could, it doesn't look like I have any test or quizzes that Thursday or Friday. I do have a psychology test the day after he leaves. How will it be when he leaves? I wonder if I'll be really depressed. Probably, I'm probably making it harder on myself. Probably harder on both of us. ",1
"I cannot believe that I am actually writing and doing my assignment on a Saturday. I am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying to talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and I got nowhere with my friend. I feel so bad for my friend, Jimmy. He is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. I feel like I should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. I guess that I should talk about myself and not about other people, but I am just so worried about him. I have been so extremely busy today. I woke up at 7 this morning. And I had to go to a BASIC meeting, which I am very involved in. I just happened to be 2 minutes late, and now I have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next Friday. I guess I don't mind if I do it to learn not to be late anymore. Then I had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. I didn't want to go, but I felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. I am glad that I went because they are my family and they helped to support me when I needed them most. Actually, my friend Jimmy, which I just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when I asked him to help me move b/c he had a truck. I asked way in advance, and I called him the night before, and I even told him that he could back  out and I wouldn't even mind. He actually said to my face I don't want to do it when I had driven all the way from Houston to Austin. I couldn't believe that he had said that! I was so mad! I mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. Then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. I got prideful, and I said that I would take care of it myself. Then I realized my pridefulness, and I prayed to God to break me down. He definitely showed me how I need to be more patient these days. I then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. Our mutual friend had before, but Jimmy somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. I don't know. I then thought about and then prayed some more, and then I realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. I went to California on vacation, and I had bought him a key chain b/c I knew how stressed he was. I put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for the gift, or even said that it was partly his fault for not helping to move. The fact was that if I wasn't living by myself, then I could have gotten more help. And if he said that he was too busy, I would have understood, but he  said that he could. Everyone said that he should have been better about the situation. But he is so depressed and distraught and etc. I wished that he would ask for help sometimes and try so hard to handle everything by himself. I know that he is angry and bitter and mad at so many things and at so many people. I just don't understand why he is acting this way. I also have a feeling that he likes this girl  who was an old roommate. Everyone knows. For some reason he is just acting more cranky and weird. we all think that he should just be open and honest. I hope that my (girl) friend can handle the situation well. She doesnt happen to know, and I don't want her to have to be stressed out about something that might hurt the both of them. I just hope that everyone gets better. ",1
"I am eating a Hershey's bar with almonds. I told myself that I would only eat one little square of it, but as I can see, that didn't happen. You would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry. For more sweets. That's interesting.      As I'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on AOL instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words I've already typed, so I have to keep going back and deleting and starting over. Annoying.    Over the Labor Day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way. On that note, I used to not like having a birthday so near a quote ""holiday"" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and I wouldn't be able to get together with all of them. Now that I've entered COLLEGE (smile), I've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday. To spend with special people (bigger smile). Anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) I celebrated my 18th birthday with my family and my BEST friend.     My mom used to attend UT Austin, in fact, both of my parents did. Unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home. Anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years.    My dad is a self-employed architect. He used to work for a large corporation in Dallas, but hardly had time to have a life. A life away from work, that is. My mom likes to say that when I was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - AHHHH! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: ""Look, there's your Daddy. ""  Now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons.    My little brother, Matthew, was born when I was nearing 10 years old. Currently he is seven years old, in second grade. He came as a HUGE surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile. But obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong. He is very active, and shows so much love that I don't know how such a little body can produce it. Right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, Patrick.    Speaking of Patrick, I met him in high school. We both attended Health Careers High School, a magnet school in San Antonio. By chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year. That was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together Project Graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation. Actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 1000 students total; around 204 in my class. I didn't get to what I was saying, but I guess I'll leave the juicy stuff for next time. ",1
"     Today is a dreary day. The clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. I think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. I almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. I don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if I just think it is because that is what i have always thought. I want to be quiet. silent. Reflective because I need some time to think and not be social. I don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. I think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. I need to go to that church that Kelly went to , but I don't know how to get there and I feel bad that I didn't go today, even though I went to bed at 4. I need to do a better job next week. I really am begining to miss Omar and my family. Living in Austin is fun but I think I am going to get sick of it if I don't take charge of my life now. I want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. I want to be different and I haven't found exactly what I'm looking for. I still haven't found what I'm searching for. It is really hot in here. I wish I could turn the air down. but Katy is asleep. She is so crazy. I guess I like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. But i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if I am not careful. I really want to go shopping but I don't have time. Maybe tomorrow. I want to buy so many things. I have so many ideas but I have no money. Whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. I could have so much fun if I had a whole bunch of money. I would go to all the vintage stores in Austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. I think then I would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? I wish that I was bulletproof. I wish Omar was here. We could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. We need each other. He can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. And i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. It would be so great. Oh well, i don't think that will happen. Last nite was soo crazy. But I am glad I went, just because I need to experience all that I can so I can really know what I stand for and am comfortable with. If I just stay here and do things I know, then I will never be sure if I am really being real, or just what I think is real. I need to try everything so i will  know what I'm not missing. or what I need to get more involved in. I hope Heather, Athena and I can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. I think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. I can't belive I cut myself on my bed today. That is so retarded. And it really hurts. I think Allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how Omar and Ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. Haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. I can't belive it. I love Radiohead. it is so comforting. At least I don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. It is a strange feeling but I really like it. It's like, i can do anything and no one will know if I don't want them to. That is a eerie and almost scary feeling. Sometimes, when I consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. I am tempted to think there are no little things.  I hope Omar will write me a song sometime. He really needs to. I can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. I wonder if I just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. I would think that naturally he would, but then again I can rarely predict him. He would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. That is sad. I really wish he would be different . He has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. Ahh. ohh well, it will work out. I am glad i have him, because I don't want anyone else,. . no one. I a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. Well, this is almost the end. The end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. I have so much to do today. I love this music. I want to paint. I need to create something beautiful, and be productive. This is actually the beginning. not the end. Here I go. this is going to be one great year. I have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep. ",1
"     wow this assignment seems pretty easy for a homework assignment. unfortunately I was unable to find the OPERA page for the prescreening, so I am now doing my homework although it's actually due friday. I should not procrastinate. I need to go to with my roommate to eat at j2 tomorrow at 12:30, instead of at kinsolving. I like kinsolving better than j2 but the food isn't too bad either. my girlfriend is online right now and talking to me, I wonder what her I'M box says while it flashes on my computer monitor. I will go click on it now and check. she was wondering what I had to write about for psychology class. I told her I had to write my stream of consciousness for 20 minutes. I'm starting to run out of things to say for this thing, although my mind is constantly thinking and putting material for me to write on this. wow it's only been 3 minutes so far, I still have a long way to go. I really can't think of anything to write in here. I wonder if I should capitalize all the 'I's in this thing or now, or whether grammar matters at all. oh my girlfriend IMed me again I think I'll go look at what she has to say. she has to go practice chinese for her class. hmm only 4 minutes now, I don't' think I can write for another 16 minutes. I wonder if I can just stop writing right now and just turn it in at the end of the 20 minutes. but wow this thinking is actually still providing material for me to write in this thing. stil a lot of time left, my hands are starting to get fatigued, and my contacts are drying up. it's getting late and I'm getting tired at the same time. should I go to my math class tomorrow or not. my roommate is playing a really loud tv show, it appears to be star trek enterprise, I can't really concentrate with it playing in the backgrond. I am really tempted to watch it though, instead of writing this thing, but I suppose I should write this anyway. I want to take a shower too, but I can't because I have to write in this thing for another 13 minutes. the reptilians will take their place. Says the tv show. I want to watch the show now I think I will. my roommate is pouring water into a cup and drinking from it. my body is a bit sore from working out at gregory earlier this evening. I also have a canker sore in my mouth and it does hurt a little. I think I will ask the psychology teacher tomorrow about the prescreening thing. I wonder if I'm spelling tomorrow correctly. I think I will go on to dictionary. Com and check. it appears I have spelled 'tomorrow' correctly after all. I'm satrting to just space out while writing this thing, and getting rather tired. I like playing espn football 2k5. I usually beat my friend matt in it, but not my friend philip. I have been playing for the past two hours, maybe that is why I am tired now. I wonder if my girlfriend is done studying her chinese yet. I'm going to go check her profile. she is still away. I want a glass of water, I think I will go pour one for myself. I found a bottle of ozarka that I got from my friend so I am drinking out of that. my roommate explained to me that the star trek episode he is watching is based on the time when humans just reached space and are pioneering it, a few hundred years before captain kirk. even though the series is rather new. it seems interesting. my girlfriend is having trouble memorizing chinese. my friend clinton called and is now talking to me. it will be hard to multitask. I'm not really paying attention to him. he is asking me if I am eating with other friends. my friend did not get a bid for a frat, so he will not be pledging. we are going to a party on friday. perhaps with kdphi sorority. my girlfriend is asking what I am writing about again, and is falling asleep from doing homework. I am rather tired,  ",1
"Why do I have this pimple? Why does it matter what people look like so much? I am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. I am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their ""body"", because their new ""body"" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. I went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. My best friend and I had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. He has a girlfriend, and I just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. It was HORRIBLE. It was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially ""accepted"" you had to have a beer in  your hand. Now, one might think that would be an excuse, but I didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. For some reason, I want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. Thanks. :o) Well, it was so dumb. My best friend and I walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and I'm not all about that. I am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. It doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. I am more a people person. I like to make people laugh. I don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way I am. I have this quirkiness (thanks Sooze) about me, but I love it. I don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because I am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when I had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. My whole life, I have been nice, and I go by the saying ""Nice guys finish last"". I had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is ""nope"". I was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. Okay, I know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. Two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying ""Aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying ""oh, he is ugly"" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave ""See  you around"", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 12 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare. I promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, I would get those stares. Thank you for your time. ",1
"Okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. I have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. But I am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but I am getting the hang of college life. Most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. I want to stay, besides I went to Dallas last weekend for Labor Day for my sister's birthday. I got to see my best friend Zach who is now in Colorado trying to wrestle. But I am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since I will there the first weekend of October for TXOU and the Santana concert. Then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. My oldest sister Maggie is bringing her new fiance. I haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. They both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a Catholic church. Catholicism is kind of funny that way I come from a very strong Catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the University of Dallas which is Catholic and not Liberal UT. However, my parents strategically placed my in Dobie, next to the university Catholic center. Smart people. Little do they know the last time I went to church was when I was in Dallas. My dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what I have wanted to do for the majority of my life. But last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now I am in Dean Speck's architecture class which is fascinating I love it. Who knows when I'll figure out what I want to do, I do have the feeling that no matter what I decide to do that I'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. But that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. My sister Jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her LSAT and apply to law school. She is even applying to UT Law that would be cool if she was down here too. I like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. It's not that she places that responsibility on me but I am the closest to her out of my family so I am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. Yeah, she's applying to law school. At least she has some sort of direction. It's hard for her to hear the truth. But I slammed it down her throat this summer and I think it hit her. I wonder when Kim is getting home. I think she said 5:00. I like having the whole suite to myself though I can actually get some stuff done. We have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with Reese. Reese is probably lonely without Jessica around to bug her. I hope I get her as my Diamond Sister, that would be really cool. Kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see Dave Matthews Band one of my favorites. I have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so I don't think I am going to go. Unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. I'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. I miss my dog. It took me 17 years to get a dog and I finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and I leave for school. I'll probably breed labs when I'm older I love Labs and I don't see why I'd ever have any other kind of dog. My suitemates are really organized I am typing on Amy's computer and I'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, I'm done! ",1
"I don't know what I'm doing tonight. There's a Cory Morrow concert at the Midnight Rodeo place on Ben White. I have no idea how I would get there. Maybe I could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. I was just looking online and saw that some OU/UT tickets are going for like $2000. I don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. I just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the OU/UT game. Pretty cool. Ya, Mike's getting upset at me cause I'm not going to College Station this weekend. Instead, I'm going to go see Jerry Jeff Walker in Gruene on Saturday. God, I hate this Nashville country thing. I got to change the radio station. It's upsetting. I wonder where my roomate Houston is. He was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. Oh well. I got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. I wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. I want to go play soccer tonight at Clark Field, but they're like watching American Pie 2 tonight. That's really cool. Oh well. Haha, it's only been four minutes? This is going to take forever. I can't wait to go back to St. Joe for homecoming. I want to go to the alumni party before the game. Supposedly, it's pretty fun. They don't really mind at all if you're underage. Haha. My leg is hurting because I'm pressing it up against the table while i write. What other homework do I have to do tonight? Hm. . . Oh, I have to print out some Spanish worksheets. My computer keeps humming at odd intervals. I wonder what's going on there. I can't find a decent radio station that I can recieve in my dorm. I'm going to put some music from Kazaa on. Haha, just kidding. Travis Tritt- It's a Great Day to be Alive just came on. Haha. I hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because I'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. This song reminds me of Garner State Park. That was a blast. They have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. It's awesome. My buddies and I met all these cute girls from Baytown, or something like that. All I know is that I want to go to Baytown sometime! haha. My bed isn't too comfy. It could be a lot nicer. I need to fix that somehow. Great, this song is ending. I wonder what's next. Haha, a little Kazaa is next. You ever listened to   Me and Billy the Kid   by Pat Green? Let me tell ya, it's a good song. I wish I could play the fiddle that well. I need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . That'd be cool. I suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. Only halfway done. I wonder how much people write in these things. I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 35 by Pat Green. It talks about coming back to Texas when he's leaving in Kansas. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with Amy. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention Austin in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when Cory goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little Palo Alto, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A Sigma Chi guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun. Adios till next time. ",1
"Well, I'm sitting here at my computer right now doing my assignment for psychology I guess I'm really thinking about a lot of things right now, primarily what my plans for the weekend are going to be even though its only Tuesday I am already worried about something that's going to happen several days from now sometimes I get ahead of myself I guess I really like this assignment because I like typing I feel it is one of my strong points but I haven't got to practice much since my high school typing course I was best in the class back then no one was as good a typist as I was there was a really good looking girl that sat next to me in that class her name was Mary she is dating someone older than I am right now his name is Vincent I don't know what his problem is he is too old for her and she is not even in college I bet he isn't faithful to her at all that is the problem with these frat guys they don't respect anyone but themselves I wish they would take some time off from their drinking sometime and think about who they are really hurting its not fair to the other kids Mary's age not to get a chance to get to know her because she is so caught up with this college guy that isn't even loyal to her what a jerk oh well its not really my problem anyway I'm in college too high school is behind me even though I had a really good time in high school I miss all of my friends we really had some crazy times it seems so long ago that I was sitting in my senior English class staring out the window thinking about life at UT who would have guesses that when I got to UT I would spend time thinking about what I thought about in high school my friend is in the room right now he is a friend of mine from elementary school he went to the provisional program but didn't make his grades he goes to ACC now and I think he is happy there the classes aren't too difficult, I hear I wish my classes weren't so hard I feel too stressed if I don't make good grades, my parents are going to kill me one thing I just noticed is that I noticed that I am randomly using punctuation I don't know why maybe I punctuate the things that I think are more important to me I guess that's why I'm in psychology maybe I will understand these things one of these days I think I will learn a lot in psych. as well as all my other classes they are all very interesting to me they are all liberal arts classes that will help my degree actually I don't even know my degree yet it will probably be in either government or history because I want to go to law school and my academic advisor said that those majors would be most conducive to my acceptance to a prestigious law school but the thing they said that matters most was my grade point average he said that anyone with a high GPA can get into law school regardless of their major so that was good to hear it took a lot of pressure off of me to make a decision I do not really want to make for a little while anyway both of my parents are lawyers I wonder how much that affected my decision to pursue a career in law I guess I will discover that as well sometime during this course I am very excited to be enrolled in this course I think I will discover a lot about myself well, my twenty minutes is about up I think I am going to order a pizza now I still have not eaten lunch and I am starving.

"I had just returned from other interesting dinner experience at my frat house when I realized that I was just wasting time as usual. So I decided I'd turn on the old computer and do a little stream of consciousness writing. I'm sitting down at my knew desk, that to tell you the truth, has done me no good except for a good place to put my computer. My roommate, an old friend I've know throughout my life is out doing his fraternity B. S. and probably won't be back until twelve. This I really do think is funny because coming into school I was completely busy from day one, while he just sat on his beanbag chair and watched t. v. To tell you the truth all I really care about any more is the amount of time I get to spend sitting in my beanbag chair watching t. v. Although it's not really as fun as it may seem, because while sitting in the beanbag chair the only thing on your mind is when you're going to have to get up and go do stuff. I realized today in class that when one begins to get about half the amount of sleep that he used to get it does become a little bit irritating and depressing. All I can think about is when I can rest may days have turned from full productive days with good night sleeps over the summer to half ass, sit around and make up excuse my I shouldn't leave the room so I can get some sleep worthless days. I'm pretty sure that last sentence made absolutely no sense, so on that last thought I think  I'm going to leave the room for the umpteenth time today and go do things that I really wish I could accomplish by getting into bed and closing my eyes.

"It feels like more time has passed and that my life has been turned upside down. Not too badly upside down, but it is definitely different. I had friends come home this weekend and I loved seeing them, but I also realized that college is different for all of us. I noticed changes in my friends that didn't affect our friendships but nonetheless were there. I loved having friends home, knowing I had people to go out with and overall just having a blast. But- it just reinforced the distance between us once they left. I love college and all the new people I've met- I just haven't had the time yet to make the kind of friends I had in high school. I understand this, but it's frustrating to go from always having 10 people to call and talk to down to maybe 4 or 5. I met some people at the Longhorn game on Saturday and it was awesome!  I just hope that that will keep occurring and soon enough I will have those close friendships with people in college. My friends and I also talked for quite a while last night about one of our friends who went to West Point. I've realized that I miss him but at the same time have mixed feelings about that sense of loss. In so many ways I wish he were here but I know that wouldn't be right. It doesn't make it any easier, just a little bit more complicated. I'm also trying to get over my frustration of living at home this year. I feel like out of 50,000 students, I am the only one staying at home with my parents. In so many ways it's not too bad, but when I go out with friends and they can do whatever, come home whenever and so on it makes me realize how much freedom I'm missing out on. A lot of it is that I am sad that I don't have the advantage of meeting people in a dorm and making new friends that way. It's also hard because so many of the people I am friends with are all living on campus and so it's a lot easier for them to get together than it is for me to get together with them. Anytime I have to come up to campus it's at least 20 minutes and a hard time finding a parking place. It just sucks because that's really the only thing I don't like about my college experience so far. It always makes me laugh when they talk about the freedom from your parents that college brings because I don't have that. This is an awful long time to write. I don't really know what else I have floating around in my head and I still have 10 minutes. School work is starting to kind of scare me. It's like oh I have a test in 3 weeks so I don't need to worry about it now and then I know that all of a sudden 3 weeks are going to have passed and I'm not going to be prepared. I love not going to all of my classes everyday. It makes it seem less difficult. The one thing that really sucks about my schedule is the fact that I have these huge breaks between classes. On Wednesdays and Mondays I have 3 hours between classes and 1. 5 between 2 others. The worst part is that I don't know what to do with the time and I can't go to my dorm because I don't have one. I'm starting to hope that the next writing assignment isn't to explain your feelings about college because that's what I've done in this one so I might be stuck at the computer for awhile next time. I'm listening to the Titanic soundtrack right now. I've been listening to it a lot lately. I think it's because it's pretty relaxing and it calms me down. The music is beautiful and it makes me think of the movie. I went to see Titanic twice. The first time the movie cut off in the last part of the movie. It totally ruined the effect and it really sucked because they turned all the lights on and well, you can just imagine. 5 more minutes. I'm really glad that I didn't have to work today. I feel sorry for the people who did have to go up to work on our first school holiday. I work up at the recreation center on campus and I love it. The people there are really cool and now there are some people who are my age. This summer when I worked there, there was no one under the age of 21 except for me. It made it kind of weird because they were all in a stage of life that I had no idea about and won't for at least another 3 years. One of my friends from high school works there and I like having her there. I hate the fact that we don't work together, but hey that's the way life goes. I wish I had more hours simply because that would be something for me to do with my down time on campus. Two more minutes. I never realized how long 20 minutes could be. I've found email to be quite handy with friends because I can email my side of a conversation in about 5 minutes instead of having to go through the pain of writing a letter, putting it into the mail and sending it. I have no mailbox so it makes it even more difficult to mail a letter because I have to go all the way to the post office. Whoever thought of neighborhood community mailboxes with no drop box for outgoing mail needs to be laid off of his or her job. Well looks like my time here is done. I guess I have one more to do but not until tomorrow. ",1
"   I'm sitting here, listening to the hum of the air conditioner outside my window, on my balcony at University towers and I'm wondering the hell it has to be so damn loud. A better question would be why couldn't they attach it to another outside wall that isn't in the middle of my balcony. I've never felt so bittersweet about a single inanimate object in my life. On the one hand, I adore it because I'm from Chicago and am seriously freaked out by the hellish temperatures and hot wind here. If there was no air conditioning and I had to sit in the heat all day like the bums on the streets, which I've noticed an insane amount of, I'd flip out. Why are there so many bums here?  I don't really know what to do when I pass them because I feel really really bad and want to help, but it's irrational and not possible for me to guive change to each one of them and then there are the questions like what will they do with the money and why aren't they getting off their asses and getting jobs in the first place. I just don't understand why they are so attached to Austin Texas. True, it's an amazing city, much of the reason I am here attending this school. It has music and culture and so many amazing oppurtunities and natural beatuy with two lakes with serene settings and beautiful stars right near by. It just has the worst heat I've ever experienced and I don't see why the bums won't save their change for a bus ticket and go 300 miles north so they don't sweat to death in the heat because they can't buy water and I'm sure that's not what they'd buy if they could buy anything and I really don't understand how their bodies are still living. Which brings me back to my air conditioner which is still humming. It completely ruins the balcony. There is no other place I'd rather sit and have a nice conversation on the phone with my girlfriend at night when it's cooler out or just hang out and smoke and talk with my buddies or some girl I'm trying to hit on than the balcony with an incredible view, but it is completely inhabitable because of this airconditioner and the pigeons and their crap all over it and I sometimes wonder how they fly so high up here because they always look fat and out of shape to me. I think pigeons remind me of chickens or something and that they shouldnt be able to fly. I can't really say why, but it is definitely weird to me that they can make it all the way up here. The Tv's on, we just got digital cable and it's pretty slick except for my dick head roomate is too big of a loser that he can't get any real girls and is forcing us to pay an extra 15 dollars a month for the playboy channel which is completely worthless because all they show is tits and it's soft core. True the girls are prettier, but is it really worth it? I think not. He's a bastard. All he does is sit on the first seat of the couch and flip through the channels all day only to pause on an infomercial and watch that for a half an hour. The kid doesn't move, he's a;ways there and he just sits there and eats food which he has purchased none of and say over and over again no matter what the conversation at hand is,   no man, but it's cool, it's cool.   The only time he's not sitting there bothering me when I bring a girl back late at night and making a fool out of himself and annoying the shit out of us is when he comes back drunk at 3 on a week night and decides he's going to study the one night that I decide to try and get some real sleep. There are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which I am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. When I inquired why he was doing this and let him know that I actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was,   No, it's cool man,   it's cool, I won't keep you up.   As if it's completely normal to sleep with blinding lights on. The time is up and though I wish   I could go on, which I easily could, I'd like to say one last time that my roomate's retarded and so are the bums and thank you for listening, Gentle Creek OUT! ",1
"and now its time to write about this wonderful stream of consciousness stuff  that we learned about in our high school English class and about all the greats  like william faulkner. you know, its kind of annoying that I should have to  hit enter at the end of each line as though this were a typewriter, you might  look into the text instructions for this window in the original scripting to see if it can be made to auto-return like some of the others do, but this is still a  rather well laid out page and method of submitting a psych project. kudos to  you. I wish my other teachers would do this. so what am I thinking about. well there's the Washington/Pittsburgh football game on TV right now. I have  no idea whose winning or anything like that because Im not really paying THAT much  attention to it or anything but Washington did make a great touchdown a while ago (aha! Washingtons in the lead thirteen to seven) marvelously exciting I know. lets see. what else. well now here's a good one. I have to write this bioethics paper about an case  study (why dont the delete options work properly in this window) on this couple who undergo an ""amniocentesis"" test on their newly discovered child (dont worry its still in her womb) and they find out that the child has a genetic disorder  called turner syndrome. what I have to do is write about this case and give my  Prof. an opinion one way or the other as to whether the couple should abort  the fetus or keep it. which means in turn that I have to come to some sort of  conclusion as to my beliefs on abortion. what a task. what a mind-consuming task but then maybe I shouldnt tell you that Im thinking of something other than my  psych writing, but then again, I dont imagine you would expect us (Im not  referring to myself as us, but rather the class (hate for you to think Im schizo  or something)) to focus directly on the task at hand since as best as I can tell the task at hand is not focusing on the task at hand quite specifically so and another thing, whenever fox sports shows a little window w/ player stats they play this obnoxious little theme music blurb on piano and I've heard it at l a million times and its starting to grate on my brain or something. so back to biomedical ethics: everything that I have been taught tells me that abortion is wrong for all the  reasons and everything, but is it fair to bring a life into the world w/ such a  condition. but then again, there are many things much worse than turners  syndrome. like what if she was born a democrat. that would suck. and now my friend from back home has just sent me a message on icq. shes a nice person. not incredibly attractive but very loving and compassionate. but none the less, a wonderful friend. shes still at home right now b/c shes going to UCLA and school doesnt start until like the end of September or something. she got  a job but I think shes still bored as hell just sitting around talking with  the little kids who are still in high school and she gets to hear them complain  about the orchestra director and all that nonsense. I just explained to her  what Im doing. the internet is a wonderful thing I think. I can talk to a  friend for free in almost real-time over icq (another great thing in the internet) any time that I want to. and now there's one of those funny Joe Namath commercials on TV. theyre just a hoot. well, my twenty minutes are just almost up, so I think that ill be off now. its been real fun chatting with you. have a nice day and all that.

"I guess right now I would be feeling on edge, or wary. It is on rare occassion that I have ever written an essay that will not be judged by the firm establishment of concrete details, which are followed by commentaries. I worry about everything, though. I worry about this class. What will the tests be like? Am I studying enough? How many times should I review the material? I know that it is better to ""overlearn"" something, but in doing so, I think I will go crazy. I try to review my material everyday. at the same time, though, there is always something new to read on top  of the previously assigned work. I cannot convert into a complete ""bookworm"" because I would not be at ease with myself. I need time to relax and just chill with my friends. It is almost a set system that I have with myself that I read as much as I can, and then I go to smoke a cigarette to calm and relax my nerves. It's kind of ironic that the thing I reward myself with will probably lead to my demise someday. at this very moment, I have a killer soar throat. from what, I have no idea. It's not the kind of sore throat from yelling, but more along the lines of say. strep throat. I'm going to be royaly ticked if it is because I hate being sick. I love to be in control of my life, but when you're sick, it's hard to accomplish because you can't help the way you feel exept by doping up with medicine that makes you drowsy. Yes, I am aware of DAYquill, but it has such a bad taste. Gross. it does work, though. hopefully what I have is just a bug that will pass like the one hour fever I had the other day. I was burning up. The only medication that was available to me was ibuprofrin. I took two of those and layed down with a cool towel on my head. like five minutes later, an officer from the HBSA called to invite me out to eat. I really wanted to go, but I couldn't drag myself out from under the security of my blankets. it really kinda bothered me that I couldn't go because I want to be able to be as involved as I can in any organization that I join. I felt as though I had let some small opportunity pass me by. it was just dinner,though, and we had another meeting today. Thursday, I will hosting for apple computer at the HBSA company night. I think that this is going to be a great opportunity, but I need to do some ""boning"" up on the apple company before I speak with any of the recruiters. of course, I will have to do this tommorrow, which is also when I have four classes, and which is also the day that I promised a friend that we would go work out together. so much to do, so little time. just last night I was talking to this guy, or one of my friends, or someone, about how amazing it is that our brains can compute so many different emotions at one time. From everything I have mentioned, I have experienced feelings of happiness, curiosity, stress, and even confusion. somehow, it seems that I am able to confuse myself about lots of things, the way words are spelled, if I really could have done something or not, or even where I stand in life. weeks before I came to ut, it seemed like I had a firm grip on life. I had a group of friends that I partied with all the time, and while I knew that wouldn't last, the end came too soon. while I still have my ties, I now stand at one of the most awkward times in my life. ut has so many different kinds of people, and while it easy to meet a lot of them, especially if you smoke, we all have this feeling inside that constantly ponders, ""What am I doing with  myself?"" I know that these will be some of the most important years of my life because I am  ""building"" myself, but I don't think I can completely be myself yet, because I don't know ""completely"" who that is. if anyone asks you for advice, don't say, ""Be yourself. "" I'd say that half of the people at this school don't know who that is. in any case, I need to go smoke. ",1
"Writing this paper on Friday is extremely irritating for me. I know that I was given plenty of time beforehand, but being the procrastinator that I am I waited until the last minute. This annoys me because I usually do this on most of my assignments. I have a feeling of regret that I didn't do it beforehand. It is hard for me to concentrate seeing that after I am done writing this assignment I am going to go back home to visit some of my friends I haven't seen in awhile. This gives me a good feeling. It is almost a feeling of relaxation and anticipation all in one. Tonight I am also going to go to a football game in my hometown. Thinking about watching a football game gives me a rush. I get flash backs of my quarterback going through the snap count, my heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety as I am about to get the ball, the snap, and a huge burst of adrenaline as I get the ball. Thinking back through each step  I can feel the emotion that was accompanied each step, only at a lower level. I am also extremely tired having stayed up way to late last night. This is probably why I am finding trouble concentrating and being consistent with certain ideas. I also feel confused because I really think that this isn't what the professor wanted, but too bad.

"   Yes, I'm finally in college. It feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and I'm finally here. It feels good to go home every now and then because I feel important. Just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. The smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times I've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at U. T. Noticing all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. There is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. I'm feeling really good about my classes and I'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. I can't wait until the weekend comes because the music I'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. I'm glad I'm in college because I here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.     ",1
"     Well, apparently i'm supposed to just type for 20 minutes.  Being that it is September 11, i suppose it would a good topic. Everywhere i look i see something about 9/11. Even the clock at UT is stopped at 7:46. All of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 9/11.         The first thing i did this morning was turn on the television, almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 9/11. Why?  So i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else. It's almost a sense of deja vous or something. (i don't speak french). I really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers hadn't collapsed. Would everyone be okay less 500 people?            I'm really ready to see us attack Iraq. Iraq is just a big problem. I've always carried myself with little opinion because why should I, ME, say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be. I don't know much, all I know is what the news tells me. How can anyone say we shouldn't attack Iraq?  If we do, I am confident that it was the right thing to do. People just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do, we'd probably say the same thing.           These new   What if America wasn't America?   commercials are really fascinating. I find them very effective. I mean, a man goes to the library, and wants to find some books, it doesn't even matter the topic, and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested. I never really thought about that. I mean, I can go to the library, pick up a book on atomic bombs, check it out, and no one asks a word. It's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned. That's pretty cool.             Actually, my favorite commercial related to 9/11 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are, and they say:   Terrorists goal is to change the way of life of America   or something like that, and then it shows the next day US flags hung all over the building and says   they succeeded.   That is just a cool commercial. I remember when there used to be flags EVERYWHERE. Now you're lucky if you ever see them. I guess that's not natural to be so patriotic. I think we saw so many flags because we needed to be reminded that we all have something in common and we need to stick together.            The news is starting to get on my nerves finally. What is really weird is me, probably like many other people, were wondering what today would be like. Would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison?  I even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more. What happens?  Everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 9/11 in their thoughts, but refuses to let it take them down. It seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that. For a while after 9/11 i was pretty scared. I wondered what was going to happen. I almost didn't even want to be in the country. But then, when thinking about what i'd be giving up, I realized that even if the US is under attack, it's still the best country in the world.            Now they are doing the   I am an American   commercial. They are analyzing how the different people say it. Makes me wonder how i would say it if I were to be on TV. Would i say it proudly, or with anger in voice (toward the terrorists), sadly, or just normal. The different tones were amazing. I never looked that much in the to the commercial until now. Wow. I bet now most people would say it proudly, but what about a week after the attacks?  Would you not say it with pride, yet more sorrow. There is just a huge amount of commercials on TV that deal with this situation.            Although commercials are effective, I feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music. Music is so powerful. You know, when you're hearing that God Bless the USA or America the Beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits. Similar to church I suppose. Whenever I'm at church I get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved. That's exactly how I feel when I hear those patriotic songs.              Well, I suppose in many ways, God was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing. The Sunday after 9/11 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches. I know I was at church. Everyone just needed to hear something good. I don't really worry about that stuff anymore. I figure it's like worrying i'm going to get the Red Nile Virus or whatever. I mean, they act like it's the terrible virus but it hasn't even killed 20 people. Heat kills more people than that. Let's go worry about heat now. No need to worry so much anymore, it is time to enjoy life. ",1
"Today has been an interesting day. I woke up late from a bad dream and instantly felt I was in a bad mood. Then I went into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal and I thought I would read the morning paper the Austin American Statesman to keep up the what is going on in the death of Diana, Princess of Whales. Since I am starting out in my major right now, which is Journalism, I find it most fascinating that such a huge world story would be at the forefront of all media coverage in every medium. It seems strange that I am 29 years old and am just beginning to read the newspaper for the first time. It is somewhat embarrassing to think it has taken me this long to be interested in my professed major. I am actually studying Public Relations, but I have to study Journalism as the foundation for my study. I guess I chose PR because my dad is the Public Information Officer for the Portland Fire Bureau. He has worked there for over 25 years and I used to accompany him to work on some occasions when I was a kid. I think I liked going to the fairs where his fire prevention trailer was set up and we had displays of actual things that had been found after a fire was extinguished. Also, we would show films on fire prevention with animated characters that would appeal to other kids. I liked watching those and helping rewind the film to show it again and again. Also, I loved helping pass out junior fire fighter badges to kids as they came in and out of the trailer.  Oops!!  I just got interrupted by a phone call while typing. It was my husband's Professor that is the chair on his dissertation. Her name is Nina and I always joke with Thomas that she likes him and is trying to snatch him away from me. I don't really believe it, but I like to tease him. I know Thomas will be very faithful to me. That is one of the things I love most about him. Anyway. Getting back to an original point from what touched me this morning was the fact that I read more articles in the paper about the death and mourning of Diana, Princess of Whales. I think the articles have caused me to deeply admire the princess and the life she led that I didn't even know about before. I don't worship Princess Di, but I feel very saddened by the fact that she is now gone. The articles revealed how much she is the People's Princess and how everyone from all corners of the world are in deep distress about her death. I think to myself, wow!  What kind of person is this to touch so intimately so many lives and to cause nations upon nations to mourn her so. She did many wonderful things for the poor and she had a genuine interest in helping children and AIDS victims. She was the compassionate and humane side of people that reached out and gave others hope, not by elevating herself, but by being a servant. In some ways, I see her doing a Christian's work of being a servant and helping and loving those less fortunate. I believe it is the most wonderful thing when people have power and/or fame which demands mass attention and respect. I love it when these people use their power in a positive way to reach out to humanity and make the world a better place by showing grace, mercy, and compassion to all peoples of the world and not just the rich or other famous. I am so grateful that we still have people in this world who are motivated by the integrity of wanting to make things great instead of showing off how much power they have, or worse yet. by abusing that power for evil purposes or intentions. I am feeling very sad once again. Why is that these wonderful people who reach out and make positive impacts on us are usually plucked out of our presence at such young ages. I wish that humanity as a whole would be more on the positive side and looking for the good in each person. Why do we judge one another and value others more highly than another. I believe every human life is precious and deserves respect and dignity. I am thankful for people such as Princess Diana and for the example she has been to so many. That brings me to another reoccurring thought. Is it good enough to just be special or important to others or does one have to prove themselves worthy of esteem by his or her works. I believe we are saved by grace and not by works lest any man should boast. God wants us to recognize that He is the one in control and we will not realize how good life can be until we recognize who is the giver and taker or life and turn to Him for guidance and help in this life. So getting back to my earlier point, taking Princess Diana as an example. Some people are mad that we are celebrating or focusing rather on the death and life of Princess Diana this whole week in the media. Well, why not. she touched so many around the world personally as well as through the charities and campaigns she was devoted to. Isn't it important to take a least a week to honor her for who she was and what she stood for, like why her death has left so many people feeling distraught. Yet others complain that it is old news already (only three or four days after the accident), or people are just bored with all the coverage because after all she was just a foreign princess who didn't DO anything like make new laws or something important like that. My goodness!!!  That just burns me up that people equate how important you are by what you have produced or established. That is unfair. I think there are lots of things made, established, what have you that doesn't mean much to society as a whole. Every day there are new pieces of legislation or rules or ideas that have zero impact on me or others in the world. Why should the proposers of those things mean more to me than someone who has actually gone out and visited the sick and dying, who has given of him or herself personally for causes they believe in. I know that when we die, all we take with us our memories of relationships we've made and times spent with family, friends, or colleagues. Why is this world so focused on accomplishments that are so ME-centered than spending our time reaching out to others with help, hope, and healing. Why can't we share one another's burdens instead of always gratifying ourselves. Haven't people realized that there is no joy greater than serving others and using your gifts and talents to reach out and build up relationships has a joy unlike any other. My wish is that people will carry on Princess Di's compassion for those less fortunate and would continue the torch of servitude to give others hope, help, and healing. We could be such a strong world if we would only learn to love and serve one another.  Well, this has definitely succeeded the 20 minute allotment. I thank you for reading this, or at least for allowing me to get these things off of my chest. It has been aching in my heart a lot this past week. We need more heroes like Diana. She is an example to us all. It is so tragic that my profession of journalism is what helped put an end to the life of one so dear and so special. I pledge my spirit to use my journalism skills to expose our true heroes for the building up of mankind, not to drag it down even to the death. ",1

"Sometimes I wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. Growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, I guess living in general. What is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. I wonder if that was His plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. In a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. As a follower of the times, my faith in Him has also declined as the years have gone on. Well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. Although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. Whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. As I entered high school, I was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. But I realized that life is only as big as you make it. If you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. But back to my point. I made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as I've moved to the next step in my life. My five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that I knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but I don't think that I realized what I was losing. My best friend with whom I spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. I didn't realize how much I would miss him until he left. When I see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. My girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. I knew leaving her would be most difficult, but I underestimated the pain. I miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. I feel like I don't know her as well as I used to and I wonder if I ever will. The leaving cut our relationship short, which also makes me wonder if our ever after will ever have a chance to grow. I guess the point of this is that sometimes we don't realize what we have until it's gone. and maybe realizing is worse, or maybe it's better, I don't know. Anyhow, I wonder why we're here, and maybe being away from everyone will help me figure it all out. But for now, I guess my hopes and dreams will drive me to care not what everything is worth, but to be happy that we get a chance to be here, happy we get a chance to grow up, make friends, go to school, learn amazing things, fall in love, and, of course, be alive!

"Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 4. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to Texas A&M too. Which makes things even more confusing. One, if we were to become boyfriend and girlfriend would things really actually work out doing the whole long distance relationship thing?(It's only an hour and 45 minutes away, but still that's different than living in the same town 5 minutes away) Also what goes on in my head is would I really want a boyfriend right now just starting off college and would I really want to put up with whole long distance thing. I can't stop thinking about him and I think he would be worth doing it for if that was what he wanted too. He is actually 3 years older than me, so I know and recognized he already went through the whole party and chasing all the girls phase that a lot of people go through when they first start college. I don't even know how this guy exactly feels about me so in ways I am crazy thinking all this stuff so quickly and soon in my head. I just could tell how much he cared by his actions and things he said that he must be feeling the same way that I do, but who knows I guess time can only tell how the future of my grades and how this guy and I are going to work out, so I should probably stop stressing and worrying about it so much. I guess I can only prepare myself the best I can for all my classes and whatever happens with the guy I guess is ment to be. ",1
"I am watching an episode of Mad TV and they were doing a parody on the whole parish priest / alterboy thing, singing Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"". The whole thing makes me sick when I think about it. My desktop died on me while I was up at UT and I am shopping for a new computer. The soonest I could get one would probably be Christmas, because of the long delay in shipping and the safety issues of shipping it to home and having no one there to sign for it and shipping it to the dorm where someone might take it and I would never see it. But it really sucks that my desktop would just crap out like it did. At least I still have my laptop, even thought it is a brick, weighing over 10 pounds, but I chose it and paid for it. All in all, life on the computer side just sucks. I wrote this during Labor Day long weekend, so I just sitting here at home in Houston until tomorrow when I go back to Austin for a long haul, as I call it where I don't go back home until another holiday/long weekend. But I don't mind, I really enjoy living in Austin, although the dorm I live in sucks due to construction noises. I have late classes on TTH and I don't get up until like 11, but I still am awakened by construction at 10 or so. Even though I didn't know my roommate until I move in with him, I do not regret going potluck. He is pretty cool, and he respects my wishes and I do the same for him. He has early classes on the same days that I do, so he doesn't bother me when he gets up in the morning, and I don't bother him when I wake up, because he has the same classes at the same times as I do. So that is cool. It's an oddity that I am writing this, for I do not really know how to write papers. So I decided to write this like I would for my blog on LiveJournal, like I am writing to my best friends. When I get back to Austin, I need to get my Calculus book and maybe find a movie that me and my friends can go to, just as kind of a day off thing to kill time before the daily grind starts again. Sadly II feel like this after only one and a half weeks of school at UT, into my freshman year. But the work is not the problem, the problem is the walking, but I will have to just get used to that aspect of UT. ",1
"Yeah so I am so stressed right now and I am wishing that I wouldn't have eaten that popcorn because eating isn't exactly that best reaction to stress. I could get FAT!!! I don't want to be fat. I mean I know that college girls gain weight naturally and then they lose it after a few months at school! Right?!?!? But I am trying to run a lot!!!! That way, I can burn stress and burn calories. EXTRA CALORIES!!! I am having a hard time not getting irritated when I eat a lot. that's weird huh!? That it's when I am hungry that I'm not most irritable. hmmmm well Today when I went running, I realized that I should have stretched because it's going to be hard to continue running everyday when I'm tight. and get this! I've lost 5 lbs since I got to school. But How?!?!? I've been everything in sight and building new leg muscle through running! Oh well. Still I was kind of excited! But I am mad that I haven't started my period yet. My mood swings are terrible and so are again. My eating patterns! And that's when I find it hardest to study especially when the subject is something I don't like. SPANISH!!! UGH! I want to move to Spain and learn it by living with people who speak it! But I really don't want to go to a class everyday where my instructor hardly knows English so she is slow to interpret and yet teach. Does she really think that if she say's something over and over again that people will just ohhhhhh I've heard that word before. and oh I know what it means! Poof! I mean we have to LEARN something before we can know it. Did she know that she had to use a toilet on earth sooner or later when she came out of her Mother's womb. NO! She was pottied trained. RIGHT! Well My high school Spanish teacher was horrible and I had the worst experience with that . while I got a great grade, I didn't learn that much which was really disappointing!!! I mean I am glad I got an A but she didn't prepare me for UT where my prof speaks in SPANISH all the time. not just when she is interacting with us but when she is giving us instructions on how to understand it! Would I say to a baby. Ok this is how you open your mouth. open it open it. Do you know what I am saying?!?! It kind of reminds me of those ignorant people that yell at people who can't speak English well. they aren't trying to be mean but they may say ""HEY HOW ARE YOU"" really loudly and you're like ""Dude, they aren't deaf! They just don't know that words you are speaking or the way you say them might be very confusing to someone"" Right?!?! grr. So I feel bad for whoever has to read this because they are going to be like ""MAN this girl is so negative!"" Golly, I am right now because I see my Spanish prof EVERYDAY! like I said before. so yeah! uhhhhh well I am excited about this weekend but at the same time I keep thinking of how behind I am compared to everyone else here at UT, intellectually and academically! I mean I feel so insignificant some times. However I know where I get my wisdom from and that is Jesus Christ who makes my knowing God possible! He saved me from the depths of HELL! And even after doubting him so much and having to research Jesus' life and creation and all that. I have found that He is the one . He is my sufficiency! I mean who knows more than the God of the universe, the creator of the heavens and I am so in awe in how he provides for me materially and more importantly Mentally, emotionally, Spiritually, and Intellectually! I mean who could know how to live like a human any better that the God that came to live like us at a point in time (point in time meaning 33 years roughly out of so many thousands of years) There is just so much opposition to him right now. I mean there always has been obviously (that's why he was put to death. well actually God let him die as a sacrifice for us!)but I just want everyone else to know his love and I really don't feel the need to push it off on anyone in a ""bible beating"" manner but just to love them through how I treat them. Hopefully. I wasn't too negative for . you know what I'm just going to shut up and whoever reads this. PLEASE LOOK FOR JESUS WITH THE PRE_SUPPOSITIONS that he doesn't exist. expect to find him and I know you will! To his glory alone!  ",1

"It seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and I lack control over when that thought surfaces. I have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, I need money. I can list what I need to do but once I get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. I can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. Well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, I think he's the one I'm going to marry. This relationship is just too good to ignore, so I wonder about him a lot. We have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. I've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and I noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. I still have a better work ethic than he does. But he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. I suppose also, I'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. I am a rather independent person. I don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and I don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but I rather spend a day locked in a 4 X 4 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. Now that is what I call companionship. I haven't had a best friend like him since I was 7. I don't think I would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 4 hours away. Another thing that concerns me is the way I have organized my higher education. I haven't really picked out a major, I'm not even on a reasonable track. I'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what I like to read about but I don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. I like math too, and I want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though I don't plan on majoring in any of those. My major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and English classes, and I absolutely hate English. I wanted to go to UT because I wanted to learn more. I like some of school in that I like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that I would have never thought existed. But the way UT works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. We are learning in order to work. Why can't we learn just to learn. Maybe I will be a social science major.

"I don't ever know what to talk about in these damned things, although I know that the point is just to write whatever comes to mind. Nothing ever seems worth committing to anything besides a fleeting second of short term memory. My eye itches. I wish Keith would stop singing that opera crap so I could concentrate on what I am doing. Oh, wait, this is what I am supposed to be doing. My head itches. What am I going to do about Elizabeth? On one hand, I want to be free to enjoy college life, having my own apartment, and the like, but at the same time, I wonder if pushing her away will be the biggest mistake I ever make in my life. Sometimes I kind of wish that someone else were making decisions for me, or at least the tough ones. My stomach hurts a lot, thinking about this all the time. I hope I don't get a ulcer. That really would suck. My head itches again. I wonder what Jeff is doing tonight; I should call him and see if he knows of any parties going on. I should probably take this keg shell back and get my deposit. Is Charlie here? He needs to call his mom. Oh crap, I was supposed to call my mom back. It will have to wait though. Damn homework. I wonder if I have anything else to do tonight besides this. Economics. no, Chemistry. no, Philosophy. no, cool no other homework. I wish I could type as fast as I think, that would be nice. I hope my mom isn't too mad that I'm not coming home this weekend. she'll get over it. I hope she understands though; I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings. She really is good to me; so is Dad though. I wonder if Dad is back from his trip yet; he sure is out of town a lot. Maybe he will retire soon, and live off mutual funds. He'll probably wait for Katie to move out though. I wonder if Dean will ever move out; maybe he's finally got his act together  I hope he does, anyway. I wish I could do something to help him out  if nothing else but to see where he could be, where his potential lies. I think even if I could find the words, he would not take the time to listen, or be willing to listen, one or the other. Is time up yet? No. Hmmm. what am I thinking now? All these question marks. makes me feel like the Riddler or something. I wonder if that means anything, that my ""stream of consciousness assignment is flooded with question marks. Apparently, there are still many questions in my life. Will they ever be answered? More question marks  great. So many questions, and not enough resources to answer them by. Not to mention the fact that no one can help because no one else is in the situation. I wish there were some way to link with someone  make them feel what you feel and know what you know  maybe get some reliable advice for a change. ",1

". Stream of consciousness well, in other words, free association. I can accommodate this assignment. It's amazing what some of the most ordinary things or objects can really do if studied. As I was walking home from a stressful day of calculus, chemistry, and psychology, I passed a squirrel searching for food on one of the lawns of a building. The animal was wandering curiously close to the sidewalk where students were walking. On normal circumstances, squirrels and other such rodents would run away as fast as possible on first sight of humans. However, this squirrel continued to hunt for food as I walked by it. I stopped and watched it, it would insert his nose and mouth into the ground and bite at some apparent food object, try it and eat it if the food object was of any value to the rodent. Curious I continued to watch, wondering what else it would do. I approached the squirrel, closer and closer. When I had come too close the squirrel dove into the ground, attempting to camouflage itself with its grassy surroundings. Fantastic! I never knew that squirrel had the notion of of trying to camouflage or hiding itself. I had always thought they would run and jump away. I remained crouched on the sidewalk as I continued to watch this curious little squirrel. After some time it started slowly approaching me. I continued to watch it, much like a predator stalking its prey. Without motion or movement I crouched and stared at it. It came to within 18 inches of me. How wonderful! The squirrel wasn't afraid to come towards a human. It remained there for a couple of moments until other pedestrians walked by and frightened the squirrel. Of course during my observation process many people walking to and fro classes walked by me and gave me awkward glances. I was so completely lost in the amazing little squirrel. At one point it had left its territory and wandered onto the street, it found a mass of dumped bread. The rodent gripped a piece with its mouth and ran back across the street to its territory. Once there the squirrel began to eat. After eating half of the portions, he began digging into the ground trying to find a strategic location to hide the bread. Not finding a place, I began to try to help. I grabbed a nearby twig and started digging into the ground to make some spots for the squirrel. I realized I was destroying the landscaping and garden of the lawns of the building. I was trying to help my new little friend. Finally, after several unsuccessful attempts the squirrel ran up into a tree after being frightened by other people. I felt anger, why would someone do that, I'm interacting with this squirrel. After it ran into the tree, it didn't come back down. At some point I left. In retrospect, I think I spent almost 40 minutes observing the squirrel. I was stressed before beginning my observations and interactions, but afterwards, amazingly, I was calm and I actually had an enjoyable time playing with it. I also learned quite a bit about the behavior of the squirrel. I never knew that they were as smart as I observed, I also realized even more what incredible running, jumping and climbing skills those pesky rodents have. Some may have viewed my time spent with the squirrel a complete waste, but it was actually quite relaxing and enlightening. Many new experiences have enlightened me to some of the lesser seen wonders of this world. A squirrel having so many complexities. Amazing. What about the human being or the human mind. The complexities of the mind and brain are endless or almost impossible! So many questions. It's almost mind boggling thinking about what can be so deep or interesting. Wow very very crazy. ",1
"As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. katie ",1
"People laugh at the same things over and over. There doesn't seem to be any diminishing of reward. No matter how long a joke has been around, no matter how old the recipient is; the same things seem to make people laugh. Why is that? Maybe it's because we like hearing the same stories over and over, associating them with our memories. Like ""Star Wars"". Nobody today looks at Star wars and says, ""man, check out those models! No strings? How did they do that?"" or, ""Man, that Hark Hamill is a great actor!"" But most of us can remember a time when we would have said that, so we just watch it over and over and over again. Nobody would do that with ""Schindler's List"". And the fact that Schindler is now IN Star Wars just mucks it all up. That's why everyone thinks Episode One sucks they're beyond the point where they want to see any more of that. The fact is that they're all fairly crappy, especially Return of the Jedi. Good god, was that awful! But people go back and say it was the best, because it reminds them of all the other crappy entertainment they were exposed to when they were kids. Come on, ""Care Bears"" was the most blatantly stupid piece of crap ever to grace the airwaves. Why did we ever like that in the first place? Well, it was the 80's nothing else was on. How did the end of the 80's manage to shift the entire culture of the world from pretense of high fashion to pretense of intelligence? Suddenly, everyone wanted to be knowledgeable about politics and science, or at least enough to talk about them, which was not at all. You barely need to know what the terms mean to debate something. I've seen ""very intelligent"" high school kids debate for hours on end without even knowing one of the issues. They bring in stuff that makes no sense to the argument, like the bible. What the heck does Isaih have to do with campaign finance reform? All the people in the bible lived under a sovereign government they didn't even have elections! There weren't even ideas at the time to compare to these, because the closest thing to democracy at the time was the Roman government, and we all know that the idea of reform was ludicrous to everyone but the people who got ripped off by the government. Since most of them got ripped off by being murdered, it's not like they can very well put forth a campaign. The Romans had a much cleaner system of getting rid of people they didn't like the only liability was that you had a fairly good chance of being knocked off by someone long before you reached the ripe old age of 35. Might as well have been anarchy, but then again, you need some semblance of order to keep people from panicking and having the whole thing fall apart. Of course, we know how well that strategy worked, considering the glory of the current Roman Empire. ",1
"well, I don't really know where to begin. it's my 3rd week of school and I guess it's going okay. my classes are getting harder but I suppose I'm getting into the ""rountine"" of things. i don't know wether I'll go to the ISA meeting today cause I know what kind of peeps will be there but I am definetely going to the SSA meeting. i think that'll be a really fun club cause of the people that are in it. the social this saturday should be cool. i havne't called mom today so I should do that before I leave for the meeting. on friday, I am finally going to meet this girl that I haven't seen ever since freshman orientation. i have so much stuff to tell her. that's one of the things that I really hate about college. that it's so hard to make plans with people. and that you can only catch them at certain times cause no one's in their room all the time. damn, we have this cricket in our room right now and I don't know where it is. i've tried looking for it so many times but I can't find it. it keeps chirping every now and then, sort of letting us know that it's still there. haha. ti's so annoying cause at night the little thing thinks it's outside so it just chirps away. anyway, what else is going on. i don't really like my calculus class cause everyone in there is really snobby and already attached to their own group of friends. i don't know how that happened and where I was, but whatever. you'd think in a class like calculus there'd be a bunch of nerds, but not at all. i have to go shopping soon. i need one of those wallets with the key chain thingy attached to it. that would make my life so much easier. it's strange how little things can make your day go a lot smoother. like, getting down to the cafeteria right before it closes. or meeting someone after a long time and spending the whole day with them. or getting a call from someone you love. or realizing that you're going to be okay at UT. or getting a good night's rest after a long time. those kinds of things. okay, that was a really weird tangent. anyways, um. got nothing to say. oh, okay. i find it really hard to get on line once I'm at college. i dunno. i just feel like it's a chore to talk to people or write really long letters and I'm sure my friends are getting a little ticked that I'm doing that. but, I just feel like I'm wasting my time on the comp. i really want some grapes right now. i went to HEB yesterday and I got all this fruit. actually, I think I got too much. but anyways, I got the really big maroon seedless ones. oooh, they are the best. i wish they had better shopping places on the drag. either it's too expensive, or the clothes just suck. I feel like going out today cause I don't have a class till one tommorrow. maybe to a nice restaurant or something. well, actually, I'm finding it really hard to make myself do something. like, for examle, I need to mail out the thank you cards for my graduation party, as it is, they are already 3 weeks late. and I just don't have the will to do it. i mean, I see them everyday sitting on top of my desk, but I jsut don't do it. and I have to look at my bills and balance my checkbook and stuff but I hate doing that kind of stuff. i dunno. i guess I'm just getting too lazy. the other day someone accused me of that, and proved it to him by doing something taht I would have ordinarily not done and when I told him about it yesterday. he just said that I did it for me not for him. it didn't really make a difference to him wether I did it or not. and I realized that was true. when you do something out of spite, you're not doing it for anyone else but yourself. i miss my mom. i need to send her a card soon.

"I will now try to track my cluttered and random thoughts. as they occur. I am thinking of the love of my life; my girlfriend. We have been together for quite a while and I am truly excited to be a part of her life. I wonder how much longer we will stay together, because I am hoping that my neurotic and almost unbearable tantrums won't strip us apart from each other. Anyway, I try desperately not to think of such negative possibilities, yet they plague my mind sometimes. I have just taken a glimpse of my surroundings. I have a gorgeous view to my right. two large windows forming a 90 degree angle provide a soothing sight. Everything seems tranquil outside, since I am not part of it right now. Everyone looks pleasant and kind, although once I leave this room I know very well that those same serene faces I saw from my fourth story view are far from angelic creatures waiting to befriend someone like me. I like having the security of this window quite a lot. It isn't as if I seclude myself from the rest  of the world at all times, or even want to for that matter, but when life is overwhelming in its abusive tendencies, a break from the constant interactions of it can be appreciated. I am more of a solitary person in these respects. I like to be alone. I like to have the opportunity to just think and think until my mind swells with confusion, questions and lack of answers. I can only speculate why things are the way they are, but this is what I am good at. I like to think without anyone pestering me with questions or remarks of disapproval. I play along with the narrow-minded each and every day and the jeers and taunting that accompanies such individuals. My privacy keeps me sane and feeds my need to vent any emotional clogging. These people who seem so distant from people like me are the same people I am left to befriend, because unfortunately, like any other human being of this world, I need friendship, companionship. It is a necessity. I hate to admit it, simply because I want to view myself as some sort of rebel or ultra independent, yet I know this to not be true. Yet, time after time I find that it is terribly difficult to maintain friends because I am left with people in college(the most convenient to meet) and I have had so little in common with such people. The cycle repeats and repeats. I am late for a class now because I wrote this damn thing, but this is my fault for not watching the time more closely. When I start to ramble about my life I REALLY RAMBLE about my life. Advantage or disadvantage????  I don't know yet. At least I can listen to others. good reason to be a psychology major, right?

I remember a science tech class I used to take in 8th grade. all years go back to 1988 almost everything has some tie in my mind to 1988 I don't know why and It pops up o very often. It's Like velma from scooby do all cartoons go back to Velma, I guess you'd have to see Cartoon network to understand it, m thinking of my mom It's odd but I sometimes worry that she worries too much about me, she was really overprotective but very loving, and now I still have feelings like hatred for being held back by her over protectiveness. SO whenever we are together I try to make sure she doesn't think I turned out goo because some how I still feel a grudge against her methods and think I missed out too much when I was little. nnnnnnnnnnnn captain N that was a cool cartoon. hmmm I wonder I caryn is around or Selena they are kind of friends of my best friend so It kind of awkward but I think they really like me more than I deserve because Ryan always says things to them about me and well I'd like to get to know them better but It awkward because he was friends with them first .

"     I am at a study hall room at the time wondering what I will think about that I am going to write. There are people behind me talking and one went Ole Miss which makes me think of a friend of mine from high school who is a freshman there now. I wonder how he is doing now along with all my other friends that is not attending UT. There are actually several people going here from my high school but I only see about half of them on a regular basis. I am a little stressed with all the things going on because I have done the thing that everyone has said not to but I think no matter what it happens to everyone. It is just the thought of all the freedom and then all of a sudden a couple weeks go by and there are quizes, tests, and papers due at the same time. I am also stressed about so many different things such as a typical college freshman is. One guy said that his fine arts was theater and dance. That made me think about when I was confused on what to take when I was signing up for classes. People ask me what this is that I am typing because they can read exactly what I am thinking. I am actually hungary with all these people talking about food. Is kind of a word? Not sure but it should be. I just found a phone on the desk but completely forgot that it was mine until I opened it up. I lost my phone a week ago so I don't have any of the numbers that I used to have, I hope this is not being graded for correct grammer because I am trying to type as fast as I think. I have already been typing for 10 minutes already and am wondering what else I am going to talk about. I also don't know what class I am going to drop, which haves to be done tomorrow. I cannot take 16 hours that I am currently signed up for so I will drop one to drop down to 13 hours. A friend of mine just called saying that he cannot make it to lunch. A guy is just now sitting beside me and he is about to start eating something. That makes me hungary again. He is reading everything I type and just corrected me on a mistake. I am running out of things to say or talk about. I am thinking now about my place and hearing some stories in the background. Most people are done with their homework and are asking me questions about this assignment, I am actually kind of comfortable right now at the computer. I don't have a computer yet at my apartment so it is really hard for me to get to an actual one to do assignments and get notes off the internet. I have yet to figure out how many notes to take from class since everything is different in college. I have a lot of stuff to do like go to WalMart, the grocery store and other places to get caught up on everything. Only a few more minutes left until I am done with this. I wonder again if this is for completion grade or even if it is going to be read. I bet the counselors read all these to see if we are all okay since majority of the class is freshman. Wow, I cannot believe that the twenty minutes is almost up. I'm going into a blank thought because of this pressure that the timer is putting on me for some reason. What else should I say? ",1
"     I somtimes worry that my life is just some meaninless collection of random accidents culmintating in a demise that will be unremembered. thoughtout human history we have constantly tried to leave behind something that represents our existence. for example you have the great prymids of gisa where all the old pharros are barried. you have all the wonders of the wolrd that also represent the same thing. Another way that people leave things behind in the form of their children. I guess that having a child is one of the other things that i am worried about. I just hope that when I have one I can do enough so that they will grow up to be a great person. I did not really have a father when i was young because my real one left me when I was very young. I had a step-father so I supose that I sort of have an idea what its like to have a real dad. I don't know if me and my stepdad get along well enought sometimes, I mean its not like I hate him or dislike him or anything but sometimes its just like he gets on my nerves. My mom says that a son haveing problems with a father is akin to a daughter having problems with the mother, its some wierd behavior pattern or something that trys to get the child to strike out on its own or became the alpha male/female something. I have always been very interested in martial arts, I don't know hwat it is about it that draws me to it. Its just that when I see these small guys break 15 flamming bricks I feel inspired, its like if I could do something like braking 15 flamming bricks that  I could do anything. Its like a martial artists have somehow trancended human limitations and have becomesomthing else. Its like that whole uberman thing that neiche talks about. I wonder if the statement about power corrupting is always true. Can you ake a decent person a corrupt them with power and completly change their entire outlook on life. I think that there are some people that even if given absolute power would not use it and would serve as a benevolent ruler. Just yesterday I was playing a game called DEUS EX and at ther very end you had the choice of merging with a super-inteligent computer and ruling the world, killing the current tyrant and ruling the world behind the scenes as a memeber of a secret organization called the illumiti, or blowing up this one building that you were in and completly destroy the wolrds global network which would reduce the world to a isoltated city state type  environment. I did all three endings but non of them really struck a cord in me as being the correct action. ",1
"trying to track how my mind works. I have so many different things going on in my head right now. mainly worries. I have so much to do and it seems like so little time. the scholarship, the basta website, the volunteer tutoring thing. I don't know if I'll be able to finish everything. I feel so drained, so tired. oh well. nothing is as it seems. blah, I feel like I need to just stand in a field and scream at the top of my lungs and let all this worry all this frustration everything that is inside me just come out. maybe then I can relax. I worry too much occupy my mind with so many different things I sometimes feel like my head is going to explode. ay diosito santo que vida. yawn. I feel like I need a vacation. a six month vacation away from everything. no classes, no relationship problems. or I should say breakup. I know that this is part of the problem. I've spent three years with adrian and now from one day to the next he wants things to be over. because he's not sure how he feels. we survived a year in a long distance relationship and now nothing. oh well. not much you can do. I feel sad. lonely overwhelmed at times. but I have good days. days when I feel like I could go on forever just plowing through the week the months the year until I finish my program. then what after that. I feel like I don't have a direction. I have a ba, worked as a teacher in ny for a year, now back in school to finish a certificate program. but then what I want to go to grad school, to law school maybe, but when. what if I don't make it then what. I have no plan. I feel like I just am trying to figure out what I need or want to do. who am I really. what am I going to do. I need a good day of just sleep. that would be really nice right about now. a day of sleep, of rest with no interruptions, no worries just sleeping. I don't even want to dream. just that kind of dead to the world thing. no time though. too much to do too many things going on. deadlines and commitments and work and school and everything in between. gosh I've been rambling, but not saying much really. stream of consciousness assignment. seems forced. are these really my true thoughts or thoughts only in response to an assignment. I think I'm thinking too much. what time is it anyway. time to stop maybe. twenty minutes translates to a good number of thoughts huh. time to go, I've got errands to run. what time is it anyway. good only about thirty seconds left.

"I can't ever seem to remember my passwords. And this lack of remembrance has really started to effect my disposition. Everytime I try to log on to a computer, I can't remember one password from the other and it has gotten to the point where I just want to kick myself in the head. Most of the time I just want to lie down and go to sleep. People keep on staying over in my apartment and I just can't get any sleep in the night. I can't survive with this for much longer. Sometimes, I wish I was going to a faraway place where no one knows me and I can remain anonymous forever. I don't have to wash dishes for my roommates friends or clean up after anyone. I also wish that my parents would trust me everyonce in a while. I know my limits. I care enough about myself and my future to not screw it up. Before, I didn't care about much anything but lately I've come to realize this lack of compassion, even for a moment, has adverse effects. I've come to realize that every second matters and every second can be utilized and it is only when you are satisfied that you were ahead in some way this second than the last is the only way to truly be content. Humans, especially the ones here, are really ignorant of some basic kindness. They seem to forget that they are not the only ones with feelings. And they also think that they know nothing of what they are doing to you when they know perfectly clear. Butterfly in the sky. I think most birds can fly twice as high. I was sitting in the chem auditorium in welch and it just hit me the magnitude of this university. It's freaking huge. there are more people in that auditorium then in my graduating class. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome. All this typing since the last 5 years constantly plus all the ones in the next 50 years will have some sort of negative effect. I want to dye my hair brown. but then I'll be just like every other Indian. there are more indians here than in all of the rest of america combined. After caucasians, indians seem most prevalent. dell and gates signed a deal for a huge merger. it was one of those things which I don't really care about. everyone makes fun of gates but I don't see why. the man is worth billions. he could have people killed. at the moment, there's no one I'd like to injure severely, I think I just might want to kick a few of them in the head.

"Well where should I start. First of all this has got to be one of the strangest writing assignments that I have ever had to do. I'm not even sure what to write about. My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun. not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less. then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun. then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I didn't have plans. so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I'm flag football team. well anyway, I'm not even sure if I'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today. any way I really enjoyed today's material in class. at first I wasn't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now. Considering that I have and extremely hot instructor for my RHE 306 class. Its crazy hot attractive she is. But now I'm thinking about another girl that I have a crush on. Today she invited me over to her apartment to have some burgers with her and her roommates. I'm not sure if she knows how I feel, but I'm having a hard time reading her. Usually I'm pretty good about being able to tell if a girl is feeling me but she seems to be different which doesn't make things any easier. I also got to talk to my roommates about things that had been on my mind which was refreshing because I had been wanting to talk to them for a while. Things seem to be really good between us which isn't too surprising because we're all pretty decent guys, though one does tend to get to us sometimes. I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind. On yeah, I got to talk to my parents today which wasn't too bad. My dad didn't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work. My mom called on her way to a Bible study and said that she would be sending a few things with the girl I have crush on this weekend since she is going home Friday. anyway crush is such a high school word now, what I really meant was girl I'm attracted to. What's really funny is that this is the girl that my mom has been wanting me to get with since I was in 10th grade. and every time she would tell me I would brush it off knowing that the girl was attracted to me but now that I'm into her it kind of sucks because now I have to put much more effort into it. Now don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to make it seem like I'm am lazy but I truly am not used to putting in so much work. I know it may sound cockeye but if it does I'm sorry, please don't think of me like that. what's even funnier is that who ever reads this may not even get to meet more or me meet them but any way its been about twenty minutes so we'll talk later, or I'll type and you'll read later.

"Here it goes. 20 minutes seems like a long time but I don't have to think really. Wait, that is the whole purpose. Think, Think, Think. The game my roommate plays all the time distracts me from studying but I would never say anything. Just let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Well, I see the football schedule on my desk and it reminds me that a girl from home may be coming up this weekend. Hopefully I can get her a ticket to the game. Maybe I will make a sign and put it by the elevator that say that I will buy a ticket for, lets say, $10. I think that should work. Ever since I came here I have been having trouble keeping the stupid elastic sheet on the mattress. It always comes off. It really annoyed me, I mean really annoying. So, when I went home this weekend I bought these straps that hold the sheet to the mattress. I have installed them and could not be more pleased. I have beat the mattress! Victory is mine! Its interesting that I can see all of my class buildings from my dorm room window. Pretty decent view. Tonight, I worry that I am too behind in my classes. Yet, I can't imagine that everyone in the class is. I mean, I do a pretty decent amount of work. I bet I am about equal with most students. The part that has me worried is that all of my professors say that most people make Cs in there class. That is just not acceptable. I have to go graduate school. How hard is it to go to graduate school? I really don't know. I can't be that hard. Or is it? 11 more minutes what to talk about. My suitemate just started the shower. I can hear the water running. I also hear the gun shots from that game my roommate always plays. Pow, Pow, Pow. That must be fun. I, however, am trapped in this writing screen. Write, Write, Write. Like a machine. Now I hear jazz music. I've never really met anyone who like jazz music. This kind of reminds me of Catcher in the Rye. Maybe Holden Caulfield was just a steam of consciousness. I wish I had a hunters cap to put on. Maybe I could go to the pond and see if the damn ducks were still there. Where do they go in the winter, anyway? Does someone come in a van and take them away to a zoo or something. Or do they just fly away, fly away. Ah! I've received an instant message. I can't read it yet. Must type, type, type. 6 minutes left, almost there. Nope, that is still a long time. I just noticed my rubik's cube. One side is completed, the others? You guessed it, INCOMPLETE. Maybe one day I will finish it. Ok, now my hands are beginning to tire. 4 and a half minutes left. Just keep typing. My neck hurts too. This is making me sleepy. I really want to go to sleep after this. Ah, that would be nice. BUT NO, I have to read. Lots of reading actually. In fact, psychology, 1 chapter. Pow, Pow, Pow. He says, Missed the head. "" What does that mean? Head makes me think of beer. That lager has a good, hearty head. Nice, only 1 and a half minutes left. I'm really looking forward to this being over. I guess there are harder things I could do for a grade. Like, I can't think of anything. I thoughts a clogging because I keep looking at the clock. Oh wow, here we go, and I am done! ",1
"I am really quite flustered right now, because I already wrote this assignment earlier, and the philosophy systems were probably down, and now I cannot retrieve the file from where I saved it. Anyways, hardly makes a difference though. I can't help wondering about the purpose of this assignment. I mean, the teacher hardly even knows me, and probably cannot even relate to what I am thinking about. I guess this must be a way of doing research, and we'll eventually learn about it. I wish all assignments were just as simple. But its difficult to suddenly get used to this American system of education. This does get strange and intimidating sometimes, with large classrooms and lack of onetoone interaction. But it is nice, and I will definitely get used to it. Today is Monday, and a whole new week lies ahead. I quite dread Monday mornings. not because I have to go to class, but because I have a slight fear of the unknown. what if I have forgotten to do an assignment, what if I annoy a teacher! I am really hungry. I had a small lunch last night. Cafeterias were closed so I made some sandwiches at home. I wish I had a car. Then I could go out anywhere and eat at anytime. I could even go to Sixth Street. I want to buy a sports car. I will buy an Italian sports car once I earn my own million dollars! But that's a long way to go. I want to eat at Kinsolving dining hall today. I am quite tired with the food at Jester. But its pretty far from Jester, and I hate to walk. I guess I'll eat in Jester itself. I wonder what my friends back home must be doing, especially Tanaya. I hope they miss me as much as I miss them. I can't wait to go back to India, but I don't think I'll get to go before summer. I bump into them online almost everyday, so I do feel quite close. But personal meetings are totally different things. My room is such a mess. I will have to clean it up. will do it on Thursday. Thursdays are wonderful. I have only one class, so I do all other work on Thursdays. But this is not a good habit. I eventually end up putting off all my important work to Thursdays, and then run out of time on Thursdays even! I wish the weekend were longer. I need my own computer. I'll get one soon. I hope I get a good deal though. Then I wont have to go to the lab each time I have to do an assignment. My uncle is Dallas said he could get me one for a decent price. I will probably go meet him next week if it fits in my schedule. Great, my 20 minutes are almost up. This assignment was fun. I hope that all the others are as much fun to do. ",1
Don't want to do this. This is stupid tweny minutes is so long. mtv award show is on. Man I'm missing it. Been waiting all week for this. I'll listen while I'm writing . Cypress hill . change chanel.

Maybe I should have some soup. Hope I got a Package today. I hope Mimi sent some more rolls. The last ones got moldy. Gross. Need sweet rolls. Puff Daddy get to Chris Rock.

"     i don't know what to write. I think that the music next door is a little loud, and it always is at least when I'm trying to study. when you are trying to concentrate it always seems as noises are amplified, such as my roommate, studing, every turn of a page is very loud. She is studying biology, which is unusual because usually she complains about having to study, and now she is actually studying. I'm suprised she hasn't yet complained that my typing is bothering her. I hope it's not, but does it really matter. Anyways, I hope this is what I'm supposed to be writing about, and I really hope that grammer and punctuation are not observed too closely. I think it's time for dinner, well really I don't have a choice if I want to eat on campus, since everything closes at 7. It reminds me of my job at a retirement community, where everything closes very early. I wonder how my grades will be at the end of this semester. hopefully good, it's kind of difficult though because UT is so much different than my high school. I mean this class has 500 people tha's more than my entire high school, probably close to twice as big. But, it was my choice to come here and now I must adjust to my new life style. Being in a big city is so much different from a small town, the smell, the people, everything. Rather than the pleasent smell of trees, or the occasional smell of a BarBQ, there is a strong smell of trash and the numerous buses. But, again it is all okay, and with time everything will seem normal. Is that necessarily a good thing, I wonder. What am I going to do after college, no one can tell me what to do with my life, so I have to decide. But should we be forced to decide so soon, i mean we just graduated from high school. there are so many choices and paths to choose, and what if we choose the wrong one, will we be able to turn around and go back. I picked up a package today, my mom sent me some URHA gifts. It's a good thing I actually checked the mail. At home I used to check it everyday, but here I never remember. I miss home, my dogs and my family, but mainly being familiar with everything and everybody. It's difficult to meet people, well at least for me it is. I can't just start talking to someone I don't know, but how will i ever meet anyone that way. the streets are noisy, i think its all the college, probably male, students driving by, engines roaring and music blasting, it's okay if they do that, but i'm trying to think about what I should type. This assignment should be equiped with spell check, that way you would never have to use the backspace button, or key whatever it is called. I really don't know anything about computers, which is kind of sad because my mom works for a computer company. Maybe that's the reason, why do i need to know when i could ask her and she could tell me. I reallt don't know what else to say I'm thinking that I'm glad that time is almost up because there are not any other things to talk about. These desk chairs are quiet uncomfortable, another reason I'm glad time is almost up. I sure have watched the time closely haven't I. ",1
"Right now I am feelng a bit anxious to be done with this writing assignment. I don't think I have ever written for 20 minutes straight and I don't know if I can do it. I feel full because I ate a big lunch and I am looking forward to being done with all of my homework so I can sleep good tonight. I feel relaxed and stress free and it probably has to do with the fact that I have been sitting down in front of my computer for several hours now doing my own thing. That is, anything I want to and not things that I need to get done. I feel good after doing my own thing because I don't feel commited to anyone or anything. Okay, 5 minutes have passed. I can't do this. What am I going to type about?  I don't know how to describe the way I feel or my sensations. This assignment is a trick isn't it. It is meant to show that there is no way to express them and you just feel them internally. Oh boy, I am excited about the coming week because I just joined one of the choirs here at UT and I can't wait to practice. Music makes me feel good and I love to sing. Singing takes me away from all the daily stresses of this world and helps me appreciate the finer things in life. Also, there is a girl I met in the music school that I might get to see when I go to choir. She is nice and I wouldn't mind talking to her and getting to know her better. I am know thinging about Maryann. I don't know why but maybe because the girl at the music school has brunette hair just as Maryann has. I wish I would have told Maryann the way I felt about her along time ago. The choir director is really nice. She took time to audition me with on days notice and accepted me without many questions asked. I don't know anyone in choir and I hope I make friends in there pretty quick. In fact, I don't know many people here at UT yet. I feel lonely when I eay along or I don't have anything to do on weekends. It is different from back home when I could call one of my friends up and we would just hang out together. I am now thinking about my weight. I just lost a lot of weight and I want to make sure I keep it off. Eating here at Jester is tempting to get a lot of food because it is all you can eat. If I gain weight. I am going to feel down about myself again and that is absolutly what I don't wat. The pastor this morning was powerful and I liked EVFREE all together. I will probably visit Grace Bible next week but I anticipate I will join EVFREE. They have great worship there and I like the pastor. Their first service will take awhile to get used to because it is so traditional, but I know I can handle it. I think that church would be a great place to grow as a Christian and meet other Christians. I hear Chris' voice in the hall and I am thinking about him rollerblading and the cop telling him to take the rollerblades off and walk home. That's funny. Okay. i have 7 minutes left. I can do this. Wow. time flies when you are typing about your feelings. Now I am thinking about my roommate Mike. I am wondering what he thinks about me. I don't know if he is mad at me for anything or if he likes me. I hope he likes me because I want to be able to get along with the person I am living with. I hope to be a witness to him this year and maybe he will accept Christ soon. That would be great and I want God to do that through me. I feel so sorry for Bernie right now. She has the problem with Aaron and she doesn't know what to do about it. I wish Aaron would grow up and realize that he needs to back off. He's been ticking me off lately. It makes me mad when I think about him and I'm mad now. Why does he act like a baby and whine to everyone?  Why can't he take things like a man. All he has been doing is whinning to Bernie and telling her how ""he gets lonely eating by himself everyday"" and trying to make Bernie feel sorry for him. AH!  Three more minutes!  I'm excited. I didn't think I could do this but it went by really fast. I am not looking forward to doing laundry this weekend. I have never done laundry in my entire life and I really don't know how to. What if I turn my clothes different colors?  What if I have to buy all new clothes because I messed up on the laundry?  Ooo. i'm worried about that. It is so cool that I found all these old Nintendo games on the internet that I can play in my spare time. I haven't played some of those games in 10 years and they bring back good childhood memories. My email program just dinged so I have email which is very exciting. I can't wait to read it. It is now time for me to stop writing so this is it. I leave with a good feeling of anticipation. ",1
"The day is over again and still so much to do and to think about. I hope my parents are settling down up in  Colorado with good business and a place to live. I hope no conflicts will occur although I know they are going to fight one in awhile. I miss my mom the most. she cried at the airport and I can still see those tears in her face. her voice was so weak when I called to say hello. is this it to college life? I wonder where Tim is has he called me and left me a message? I have precal class with him first thing tomorrow morning and I dont know where to go yet. I hope to get my beeper soon because I needed really bad and I dont know when ill get it. as I look at the screen I wonder if the writing will ever go down onto the next line, or will it go on forever. I really want to go home  I feel as though I have to be with her 24/7 and I feel like she'll follow me everywhere I go. I don't want her to , but at the same time I dont want to hurt her feelings. I hate it when she smokes she smelt so bad in the classroom wow it finally has moved down to the second line. this stream of conscious writing is kinda pain in the butt because it is nearly impossible to actually start typing without thinking about what to type. lookin at the screen uhhh she wants to come over today but I dont want her to I feel as though she's gonna stick with me wherever I go and I feel like she's never gonna find a friend to hang out without me. but I shouldnt think like this because shes my friend and we've known each other forever. but I feel that shes going to hold me back in the future as we go on. either that or we're gonna fall apart, not easily, but  I feel that someones gonna get hurt and I dont want to be the one hurting her. my head itches. I gotta go home and call my mom and talk to my dad. I wish they had the same kind of water here as Colorado. their water is so nice. I would like to know if Tim likes me or just as friends because he actually we act the same way towards each other but I dont know if I like him or not so I wonder if he feels the same way. my pastor is here from Dallas to teach bible study and I kinda feel guilty because I said Id see him and stuff when he is down here but I cant get my self to go and sit and listen to him. I feel bad. I wonder what lee is doing he seem so quiet yet outgoing but not really I would like to get to know him but I wonder if he even knows that I exist. I think he does but who knows. sitting here typing wondering what time it is . what can I eat for dinner? I have an eye appointment tomorrow and I want to meet Tim somewhere so we can go to class together. cant wait to go home Im kinda glad I didnt room with her I can't imagine how hurt she'll be if she really knows how I feel. she gets on my nerves time to time and she asks me if she gets on my nerves, but I can never tell her that she does because I dont think its right. I want my friends to come over to my apartment but I dont know how my roommate is going to react. how am I suppose to find a roommate for next semester when she leaves . it almost time to go  I hope they dont make us read this later on in the semester. I think I really want a boyfriend but not really, I dont know what I want. Michael is pretty cute only if he was taller I would fall for him so hard. but Im glad we're good friends. Im kinda glad that they broke up too. I think shes too self fish and he can do so much better. I better memorize the medical terminology by Thursday. what should I do this weekend I bet she wants to come with me I feel as though every time Im with her Im blocked off from the crowd in a way Im uncomfortable with her around other people. I wish she stop smoking she  looked so crappy up times up and I dont feel like typing any more. ",1
"ok, at this very moment, I'm am in pain, emotionally. Yesterday, I had a bad experience. I saw my best friend kiss the girl that he knew that I had a certain attraction too. It really really hurt, but I have gotten over it. I can't really get mad at either one because first of all, we meet the girl at a club on Saturday night/ Sunday morning and two, my friend is a little more wild and social so he was talking twice as much than I was. The girl called me herself last night, but I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore because I had lost interest in her. As for my friend, he told me that he was really really sorry, yet he hasn't come up to me yet to show his forgiveness. I'm ok with it, I just don't understand how something like this could happen. I'm in question though, I don't know if I should be mad or not?  I think of one way, which is that I shouldn't let something stupid like this ruin a long, good friendship between my friend and I, or, if it was right to begin with that my friend kissed the girl that I liked after I had told him that I liked her. N E ways, good thing its all over and I'm moving once again with my life. I try not to let this things interfere with my everyday school life but at its impossible to keep them apart. For example, I could not concentrate all day yesterday because I was thinking of what had happened. I didn't read, I didn't do my homework, which is a very very bad thing. The good thing though is that I got over it and I'm back to normal. I guess its just one of those weird once in a while incidences. Today has been a much more productive day then yesterday. I went to go see what color band I would get for the ticket raffle of the Texas vs. OU game. Unfortunately, I got the pink band, which is the least likely to have a chance to get a ticket. No worries, I wasn't really planning to go to that game, I just went to get the band because two of my friends asked me to go get it. I have a glow in the dark stars type of theme here in my room. I had never had the chance to have some in high school, so I finally did in college, and I just noticed that one of the very big stars fell off and is on the floor. I am looking at it this very moment, wondering why I'm not getting up and putting it back in its place. I also have the glow in the dark feet. My roommates, who are like really cool back from home friends say I'm a dork for having the stars, but none the less, I could careless on what they have to say because I think they are dorks too, haha. I see some dirty cloth on the floor and in that pile of clothes is my work shirt with I just happened to remember that I need to wash because I'm going to work tomorrow. Dang that a nice car, I just saw a blue BMW pass by, very very nice car. Tonight, my roommates and I are finally going to go shopping for groceries. Its been a while since we have gone to buy food. Another thing I just remembered is that I need to clean the kitchen, its my week and I have to clean the pig sty (kitchen). I got a ticket to go to the Texas vs. Arkansas game and I hadn't realized that it was this weekend. My roommates and I were going to go home this weekend, but I can't go anymore. They are still going, but I'm not. I'm kinda sad because I wanted to go see my little nephew and stuff, but there is nothing I can do about it now; I'm stuck here in Austin. I told my mom about the situation and she got kinda sad, but I told her that it'll mean more the next time I go down. Typical hispanic mom, she told me that I should of not made any other plans if I knew that I was going home, but that was the catch, that I didn't' know that the game was the same day that I was going to go back home. So what is going to happen is that I'm not going to go home after all and I'm going to the game with my friends. I just remembered that I was going to ask one of the TA's where SEA is, but guess I'll just have to figure that out on my own. N E ways, my 20 minutes are almost up, after this I'm going to hit the sack and take my usual 1:30 nap and wake up, clean the kitchen and go buy food. c-ya ",1
"My goodness, I have so much stuff to do. Where should I start?  I have to call about volunteering and for sure email Anne to see if they have a Physical Therapy program at her hospital. How will I get this stuff done. I am torn as to whether or not to join a Fraternity. I think I will, I just hope I have time to get my studies done. As well as time to myself. I really need to get my bike back from Maggie's apartment. I'm sure it's getting to be a bit cumbersome there. Sometime tomorrow I have to find a way to get to the mall and buy some clothes. I need 2 ties, a new pair of khaki pants, some dress shoes and other miscellaneous things. I am so glad I changed my class schedule. It will be so much better this way. I am so stressed out about physics. I so hope I at least make a ""B"" in there. Pray, oh pray. I should make it to the BSM Thursday evening and check that out. I am sure there are some good looking ladies there. I can't believe the Horns lost. What the heck?  To N. c. State. They better come back and win this week against Stanford. Actually we need Ricky back. Another thing is I need to wash my car. It's pitiful!  Definitely get the golf clubs out of my car. Or at least relocate them to a more convienient place. I seriously hope things go well with the Fraternity. I mean that is a lot of $$$. Campus looks nice tonite. I love the tower. I think I like college football way better than pro. It has so much more of an aura to it. The pros don't have any spirit. The college game is where it's at. I wonder where my roomate is. That punk never tells me when he's leaving. I still have to do the pretest. I tried, but it gave me some gateway server error message. I need to make sure and read for History and Government. I hope this Thursday schedule is going to work. I am starting to get a hint of missing my friends, but nothing like I thought it was going to be. Actually pretty good. Oh man, I just got an Instant Message. Oh well, I really need to finish this assignment. I kind of like this. Let's me get my feelings out. I need to find a Church for sure. I haven't been reading my Bible like I should since I got to Austin. I really need to work on that. I wonder what the rest of the year is going to be like. This move from a JUCO college is a bit extreme. Nothing like high school to college, but I went from a college with  5,000, to a college of 50,000. I probably have met 200 people so far. I am so terrible with names. I really need to work on that. My suite mates are being loud. Makes me not want to study. Or at least go elsewhere. I should probably check out the UGL or PCL anyway. I bet I could do a better job there in the first place. So what am I going to do this weekend?  It being Labor Day, I kind of have a choice. I might go to Houston to visit my Sister or might stay and go to the lake with  Richie and Jason. I really miss my folks. Way more than I expected. I hope I get over it soon. I need to email some people and say hi before too much longer. I wonder what my new Physics prof is going to be like?  Good or Bad?  Nice or Unpleasant?  What?  I need to start praying more. Maybe that will help me with my confidence and focus. Whatever happens, I need to call Gina tonite and line everything up for tomorrow night. This class schedule is going to be so much easier!  I love it!  No Friday school!  Three day weekends for a whole semester. I hope my TTH classes aren't too strenuous all together. This is my first time to really balance 3 classes like that. ",1
"Well right now I have to go to the bathroom but I can't because I'm doing my assignment. I am also very hungry I drank an orange juice for breakfast and I didn't eat much for lunch So now food is on my mind. I have to go to my dorm and read a lot because I haven't read anything for any of my classes including psy (oops! should I have written that!??) I also hope that I get a job at BEVO's on the drag. I would have to work early in the morning but I really need money right now because I am so broke. I feel awful because of all the expenses my mother has to pay. I just want to help out a bit. I need to go exercising I went to the gym yesterday for about 30 minutes and I went walking for about an hour. I am, trying to lose weight for this  dorm function on the 27th all these girls are going to be in these skimpy bathing suits and usually wear a T-shirt over mine. Not this time!! I'm gonna wear a bathing suit without a T-shirt what an accomplishment that will be!! I still have to go to the bathroom. Not real bad it's just  like this nagging pain in my bladder (sorry that's kinda gross!) But that's exactly what I'm thinking! My shoulder hurts. It feels sore, my right one. Not from typing I think It's from walking last night. It was really weird because my fingers got swollen from all the blood rushing into them while I was walking last night. I felt really good because I was getting lots of exercise. I'm also glad because I quit smoking I  never really started but I smoked 1 then 2,3,4,5,6,7!! and that's when I decided that It was a bad habit and  I didn't want to get addicted. There are some many wonderful things to look forward to lung cancer, smoker's hack, bad breath, smelly clothes and emphysema! Besides my mother would kill me before and of those other things got to. My dad smoked and he finally quit. But know he smokes cigars occasionally I told him to quit so now I'm taking my own advice. The minute I finish I going to the bathroom and after that I'm going to go EAT  I'm starving' food, food, I want food. After that I'll do my Lab, study, take a bath and go to bed. I can't wait!! Well I'm not really looking forward to the studying part but that's the reason  I'm here!! Well I've come to the end of my twenty minutes so I guess I'll have to say. . ADIOS!!!  ",1
"     I am waiting for Brad to get home. I hope that he's talking to Michael because they need to figure out what's happening before things get worse. I can't believe he's being so petty about this whole ordeal. Seriously, was he expecting us to pat him on the back and say how proud we are that he's started smoking pot. . not just a little either. . but massive amounts?  I don't quite understand how on earth he can simply think that just because he's been on medications and is immune and he's sick and is in pain that that is a valid excuse. We all have our issues to escape from, while i'll agree that yes none of us face exactly what he's going through with his disorders and his back, we have our problems too. I hate to see him like this, feeding himself bs to justify it. He knows it was wrong, i honestly think he knows its wrong and he claims he regrets it but deep down i don't think he does. This is his rebellion. What kills it the most is that it shows just how hypocritical he can be. Maybe a year ago he was bashing one of his really good friends for doing something so similar. . the guilt trips, the icq away messages, the finger pointing. Its all the same. I know thats what scares brad so much about it, because michael is his best friend, and he can't stand to see him turn into benny. Neither can i. I've known one too many people who end up permenately stoned so bad that they can't remember anything past the last fix. Its so sad to watch them as they stop being able to function. I know, just know that one of these days i'm going to get a call from someone saying that one by one they're dying off. Its so sad. Some of my best friends have become drug addicts and have nearly lost their lives because of it, and yet they continue to use it. Now they might as well be dead. . they have no personality and they'll never be the same people they once were. Drugs make you petty. They've all become petty. I worry how this effects brad. He's right, Michael basically is his only friend, guy friend anyway. If Michael were to hold this against him it would definately kill him and would seriously screw with his future. Brad has a hard time making friends. I'm actually incredibly surprised we're even together conisdering his track record. He's the shyest drama major I've ever met. He won't talk to people. I have to talk for him sometimes, and he gets upset if i don't introduce him. Most people know who he is, they just don't believe me. When i talk about him i talk about either why he's got me frustrated or how great he is, and when he meets my friends nothing. . he sits there and stares. He promises he'll try and its not something i hold against him. . yes it kind of annoys me but i seriously don't hold it against him. Marked up as one of his quirks. I have so many i guess i can't really hold his agianst him since he doesn't hold mine against me. I can't believe that Michael would hold a grudge. . he's always gotten so mad at me for having my grudges since last year and always lectured me and i've listened and tried not to hold what they did to me against them, that whole christian turn the other cheek forgiveness thing. I'm trying. . honestly i am. BUT i must admit life is SO much easier when i don't have to be around them. No constant reminder of all the stuff that happened last year. Its a new chapter in my life and its so great that although they followed me here, they don't have to be a part of it. I just want brad to be happy. The old michael wouldn't have had this problem, but he's changed recently, and definatley not for the better. Almost makes me feel the need to return the favor. Just as they controled and manipulated and abused me last year, he is their victim now, and it makes me so sad. He's a great guy. He just should have taken his own advice and gotten out of there as fast as he could. Trevor would have understood, and if he's anything like they claim, he DEFINATELY would not approve of the life his friends have chosen. Drugs won't bring him back. He died its time for all of them to move on. I just don't know if they'll ever realize that. Some won't ever . . i wonder if we can make micael see that before its too late. ",1
"I'm feeling tired because I just ate and I'm concerned about finishing my chemistry homework for tomorrow. I need to go through two more chapters today and then review all six of them by Thursday for the test. I've fallen behind because I was unable to get anything done last weekend because I went back home to Houston. I also didn't get anything done yesterday because I again I had to go back to Houston for the funeral of one of my friends from high school that got killed. He was driving to Dallas to meet his roommate and had to swerve to miss a deer. It was pretty sad considering he had most of his life in front of him. His car flipped three times and he was crushed. I found out yesterday at the service that he had a rosary in his pocket when he died. interesting. I just noticed that the Astros won there ninth game in a row. I'm thinking about going to medical school after I got my degree in Architectural Engineering. I want to be a psychiatrist if I don't continue my study of Architectural Enginnering. I've got myself listed as being in pre-med. It so happens that 10 of my 14 hours also count towards the completion of pre-med. That was one of the best things that happened when I went to Freshman Orientation in the summer. When I went to see my advisor, she reentered my registration code and it will allow me to register for non-engineering required pre-med classes like biology, etc. Chemistry is pretty easy right now, it's just that we are going at a really fast pace. I hope that he (Dr. White) slows down pretty soon. At this rate, we will be through with the book a month early. He's already covered six chapters in two-and-half weeks. One of the other classes (the one with my roommate) is still on Chapter 1. I wonder what I'm going to do for dinner tonight. My roommate and I were trying to decide earlier if we should go out or if we should just make sandwiches in the dorm. At any rate, we both have homework and studying to do, so when and if we go it will probably be late. It doesn't really matter when we go since we don't have to get up early for class tomorrow. The only day I have to get up early is on Tuesday. I have a Geology for Engineers lab at 8AM. It's an easy lab, but the Geology for Engineers class itself looks difficult. I really like everyday except Tuesday because I can stay up late and study, or go out and not have to worry about getting enough sleep. It fits my schedule perfectly. I notice that my time is almost up. I have another one of these to do tomorrow. I should have got started sooner. I missed lunch today because I didn't get back into town until it was too late. After I got in, my roommate and I went to go workout. Sunday is usually our off day, but we decided to go max-out on the bench press. We usually go workout everyday except Sunday. Our dorm is located in a really good spot. We are right between the Stadium and Gregory Gym here at Moore-Hill. It sure does make for a long walk to some of my classes though. Oh well, time's up.       ",1
"Hey what is up. Just writing my homework. I wanted to get it done before I forgot. I hate when I forget to do homework. Most of it is pretty easy but I just have bad memory sometimes. I write things down now in a little blue spiral that fits in my back pocket. I like to write down things in there that I feel are necessary to remember. Today I watched a movie called  The Rules of Attraction "". It was cool. It was meant to be one of those ""teen movies"" but it told things on a more real basis. Most teen movies end with happy endings and the main characters fall in love. Life is not like that always though. It consisted of a big love triangle that went terribly wrong. I cannot spell very well. I like microsoft Word because it makes those wavy red lines underneath words that I screwed up on. My computer is making a funny noise. My head hurts. I am running out of ideas to write about. 4 minutes 22 seconds. Still a while to go. I get my braces off in 2 days. I cannot wait. If you have never had braces, take it from me, they suck. Imagine not being able to smile for one year. It sucks really bad. I like music. My roommate is playing some music on his computer right now. He was playing a cool song but he turned it off and is playing something crappy. I told him to change it back but he did not. Now he did. Sweet. 6 min 8 seconds. Still a while to go. When I started this I did not know how much I could write in 20 minutes. I can remember assignments in high school that I would write in under 20 minutes. I really had an easy time in high school. It was fun. My school was small nothing like it is here. I lived in Little Elm, Tx, which is in the dallas area. I liked it there but Austin is so much better. I want to go to school here and finish my major (kinesiology) and go to graduate school in California. I really want to check that place out. Most people that go to school here have become Longhorn fans but I have been a fan as long as I can remember. That is cool and all but it just seems like they go to games and like the team just because they are wining. I can remember seasons where the Longhorns would win only 4 games. It sucked but you have to stick with a team. My roommate is asking me how to work the dvd player in the living room. I wonder if the teacher is actually going to read this. That was funny how that kid did not even write anything he just pasted something on the screen. good times. 11 min 20 sec. Today is Wednesday. 9/3/03. September 11 is coming up again. I read on the internet that 9/11 was a drug deal gone bad with George Bush Jr. and Osama Bin Laden. Heroin is a major export out of the middle east. The USA Gov't controls the drug flow weather we like to believe it or not. Heroin was the largest import into the United States in 2001. I bet you did not know that. Something went wrong so terrorist attacked us. I wonder if the truth will ever come out. George is a moron. If I ever saw him I would call him that. I would probably say f-ing moron. I hope he would get mad. I do not like him. I also believe he is a member of illuminati. One the one dollar bill, there is a picture of a triangle with and eye in it. The eye is a symbol that represents the devil's eye. Also in bar codes, there are three lines that represent 666. That kind of shows how evil money is and everything we buy we are supporting the devil. These are just some crazy conspiracy theories I believe. I also believe that we have not been to the moon. Woogie from borrington high. Sorry my roommate is watching Something About Marry and that is a line from it. Have you seen my baseball. 17 min 23 secs. I am getting close. So what up. I rented two movies from blockbuster. I am hungry. after I am done with this I will eat. No eat. eat eat eat. I like to eat. This is getting boring. I am almost done though. It is almost time to go. I got really drunk on Friday night and threw up in front of the building we have this class. I tried to walk home from the fraternity houses. I made it to the stadium and passes out. Eventually my roommate picked me up. It was good times. And I am done ",1
"Well, hello. I am really not sure what to write about, I guess I can start with my day. You see, I am a commuter. I live in Bastrop. No one in Austin seems to know where that is but it is a little town on the other side of the airport. So, anyway, that means that I have the privilege of driving through morning traffic for an hour just to get to class, then what is even worse it that I get to drive back home through five o'clock traffic. It is a pain in the backside. I hate Austin Drivers. On the up side, I was lucky enough to schedule all 15 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That helps because I am also a Parttime employee with fulltime hours at the only department store in Bastrop. Three years ago the store opened meaning that Bastrop now had a WalMart, HEB, and Bealls. That is about it for stores. So, about my job, I am a Sales Associate. We recently switched new districts into the Austin area. The District Manager is very strict on how the store is arranged. Last week, whoever did the schedule only scheduled me to work on Saturday for Five hours. You can not pay bills working at a minimum wage job for five hours a week. So I told my Store Manager that I would be more than happy to come in if she needed any help prior to Annette (the District manager) coming in on that Friday. In the end I worked ten days in a row, pulling in forty hours before Friday when the District Manager was going to be in to audit. I was exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around. I was thankful that my Manager let me have Sunday off, I needed the rest. Today is my anniversary, I have been dating a guy for eight months now. This is probably of no concern to you but I am very proud of that fact. He goes to Incarnate Word in San Antonio. He is an Eagle Scout and spends all summer teaching camp at Lost Pines Boy Scout Reservation. On weekends, he comes back to Bastrop to ref. Soccer games at the BYSO Soccer fields. All this volunteering helped him when it came to my parents approval. You know, one time in my Drama Class, a friend of mine started to do just a stream of consciousness monologue. In the end he was talking about mixed drinks and jelly beans, it was very funny. I miss my Drama Class. Most of my high school stuff I had to give up due to the need to be able to afford college and get my degree. I had to quit dancing, I had danced for 13 years at a local studio. Then I had to give up Color Guard, an organization that I was the captain of for all four years of High school. Most upsetting though was giving up Drama. If I was not in a play I always tried to contribute somehow. I single handedly costumed four productions in one year in my ""spare time"". Oh well, I guess that is it for mow. ",1
"I'm hungry. I want some ice cream but I don't want to walk downstairs to go get it. A massage sounds nice, doesn't it? Ryan said he'd give me a better one next time I drove to College Station to stay there again. But I don't know if I'll stay at Joey's again or not, it's just awkward with the whole Stephanie situation. I don't know what to do about her. She just ruins everything. Joey deserves so much better than her. But oh well, I have Thomas now. He seems like a really sweet guy. I was at first intimidated by him being so old, well I guess he's not really that old, just 21. But he will turn 22 in October. It still is kind of intimidating, but it's not that bad. I wonder if he'll call me back tonight. He called me earlier and I returned his call but he wasn't home. I wonder if he'll ask me to OU or if it will be assumed or what. Who knows. And I wonder if he goes for that whole cooler and painting and stuff. It was fun last year decorating Erin's OU stuff. I'm going to go broke so soon. That's why I might go home this weekend, I wouldn't have to pay for anything, lol. Hmm. I don't know. I'll probably go home, I haven't said anything to my parents yet, but I know my mom will most likely be jumping for joy. It doesn't seem like a month and a week since I've been up at school. It doesn't seem that long at all. I need to go check my laundry. Hmm. I bet it's done. Well never mind, I guess I won't be bringing Erin to A&M this weekend. I wonder when she was planning on telling me. Oh well, not my problem I guess. I was kind of hoping to see Brian, though. I already told him I might be coming down, oh well. I doubt he'll remember or really even care that much. That boy needs to get his butt up here to see me! I'm sure he will sometime. I wonder if Thomas will dress up for our KD confidential. What rock star would I be? I was kind of thinking the whole Madonna theme, with the cone bra and everything but I was totally kidding! I don't think I'd have the courage to waltz into Park Avenue with a cone bra on. I don't know what kind of rock star I'd be, though. I guess I have lots of choices. Cher. nah, I don't think I'd want to be her. I'm tired. I haven't been able to sleep much lately. I actually went to bed early last night but I kept waking up, which sucks because the whole point of going to bed early is get some sleep, but noooooooo that would've been too easy. Oh well. I don't think I like Kelli. It's like she's trying to take over my life, it's very annoying. Why does Nicole always seem to come in here when I'm trying to study? Ugh. Oh well. Baskin Robbins sounds good right about now. I have a car this year which is a lot nicer. I want to go tubing still. It seems like I can just never get there. Either everyone's gone or no one wants to go or we don't have the money. but I want to go, dammit! I need a tan, I haven't laid out in so long, but if I go home this weekend, I'll definitely be swimming and I'll get a tan then. I also want to go home to see my dog, I haven't even seen him yet! He weighs 5 pounds now! Doobie doobie doo. my car needs to be washed so badly! I drove around forever today looking for a car wash. There are so many gas stations here but do they have car washes, noooooo that would be too easy! Life just seems like it's out to get me sometimes. Anything I want to happen, the exact opposite always seems to happen. Will life ever seem to go my way? Even Thomas is going back to Houston in the spring for some job or something but it's only for 2 and a half months, but I'm totally getting ahead of myself about that situation. I don't know what to do about guys, they're so damn complicated. They're so stupid. Erin is so happy, I'm so jealous of her and Pat. He totally adores her. I want someone to adore me, but noooooo that would make life too easy, too. Chris could adore me, but I know it's bad, but he's Hispanic and I think that would make life so hard. Some people can be so cruel and I don't want to be ridiculed or stared at or something. But Chris is so totally sweet, he would be just wonderful, I know he would. But I totally don't know how my mother would react to me dating a Hispanic guy. And my grandparents would have a shit fit, but he's so wonderful and I know he would treat me totally right. Maybe I will someday, but he's not even here, he's at a&m and god knows I've dated 4 aggies! 4! It's just ridiculous. Food food food food food food food food food food food food, I'm hungry. I'm going so broke, I don't know how I'll make it through the year, I might have to work in the spring but I think that would make life so hard with the sorority and school and I totally don't want to use up my weekends. Dude, I just don't understand why Joey broke up with me. I know he and Stephanie are together. She's so psycho. I hate her. I only hate 2 people in my life and she's one of them. Life is so unfair, I would treat him so much better than her. I just don't get it! Aggghhhhhh! Ah well, something better is in store for me, right? I hope so anyways. I want an apt. I get so sick of Amy running up and down the hall every night screaming, I swear, does she just get drunk every night??? I'm getting so tired of it. Yuck. Someone's teacher is in jail, no never mind, I'm listening to erin's conversation. I really hope our friendship doesn't fall apart because we're roommates. I think she gets tired of me sometimes and it really hurts me. She gets in these moods like Angela does and I really don't want us to end up like me and Angela. I thought our friendship would be different. But Kelli's also getting on my nerves, she's totally taking away Erin from me. Ugh, I just can't stand her now. I want to take a hot bath. I want to cook something. I want to curl up in a small blanket and watch sad country love songs on CMT. 2 more minutes. This is taking forever. I think I'll go get some ice cream after this, no I really need to check my laundry. Someone's probably already taken my clothes out of the wash and they're just sitting on top of the dirty washing machine now. Great. I don't understand some people. Whoops, I need to call Brian, too. I will whenever I get done with this. One more minute. Our room smells so good, Erin's burning some candles. Does Nicole ever study? I don't think so. She's kind of getting on my nerves, too, taking away Erin. ",1
"ok so now I'm writing I'm doing this so I can just juno into the assignment its not very interesting so far and my tyoing is slower than my thinking and I had a completely different thought while I was typing that lst sentence ok now wehat I'm still typing I could talk about myself but it would sound kind of lame. my guitar is out of tune and its missing a locking nut and the pickup selector switch is missing its little decorative cover, I could buy new parts but its kind of depressing right now because I don't have any money and it makes me want to give up guitar even more we played a show last night and screwed up a little more than usual but this guy in the band before us that was pretty good but all the same kind of music pop punk was trying to intimidate me by staring at me it didnt work then but its working now the bass player said we were good but I thiought we were terrible there was no harmony the bass and guitar were out of tune anbd the drummer was playing to a different tune is what it seemed like. the vocals werent so good either. we had to cut ourset by nore than hald wich is especially bad for us sinc we have 14 songs and they are all very distinct, not all pop punk or punk ska but some rockabilly and some primus ounding metal stuff a little emo too. I  forget what else oh yeah like old school punk with the snotty vocals well. anyways my dad got mad because I was supposed to help some guy move and I bailed halfway through to go play the show, playing live is like a drug, this time it wasnt so grreat, but weve playeed about 12 or 13 shows and some have been awesome, the crowd going insane because of us were aboutt o lose it any second just trying to hold on to our instruments long enbough to make the next note come out barely even able to keep our feet on the ground. anyways thats all over now because I have to get a job and go to college and theres no time for it ill find other ways to make myself feel good but that was a grweat one and I know my bandmates are depressed about it too. anyways my dad was mad because I did that and left even though I got the 40 bucks and so he's really mad and I don't even feel at home hre, at home asnd I don't feel completely at home in my dorm so I'm restless and it sucks. anyways so thats the whole of that messs and I'm just ttyping now because that whole thing was like one big brain sigh and now I'm breathing normal again. stop. nothing to say. maybe the brain works like that spasms of thought and then kind of a rest. I guess mr pennebaker would know, anyways I smell cinnamon buns and so I'm going to go downstairs for some brakfast and tension and so the food is going to tase bitter, I sort of awant to fgo back to my dorm but I don't really have any friends there yet. oh yeah I was going to go well that was about 20 min stop.

"Okay, I am very frustrated right now. I just tried to complete the pretesting survey and I was unable to get on to the web site. I tried for a long time and it still wouldn't work. Anyway, I have so much work to do and I don't feel like doing any of it. And just thinking that I have my economics class at 8:00AM tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better. I can't wait until my weekend comes. This past weekend was awesome. My friends came up to visit me for the whole weekend and we went out and stuff. My boyfriend, who I haven't seen in about a month, also came up with one of my best friends on Sat. I was really happy. Gosh!!! I am really uncomfortable in this chair at this desk. I have to put the keyboard in my lap because we don't have anywhere to put it. my back is hurting. my roomate looks like she's really comfortable in her bed while I'm here all twisted in my chair trying to type. I wonder why I'm having trouble thinking of things . It should be easy to just type whatever comes to my head, but, it's like my mind is not all here. I can't believe that I almost lst my key today. I got home after being gone to two cclasses and I realize that my key is gone. I don't have fifty dollars to just throw away. I wish I was kind of rich. no, not rich just better off than I am right now. I would just like to live comfortably. with just a little extra cash in my pocket. ouch ! my back is really bothering me right now. maybe after I finish this I should go and check if I can get on that pretesting thing again. waht is I keep haveing trouble with it?  and, what if I never get it to work?  then what?  well, maybe I can go to somebody elses computer to do it. I wonder if it's the computer that is not working. I don;t know . but then again, I'm also computer illiterate. I can't bele\ieve that 20 minutes have not gone by yet. ohhh, I;m so tired. I still have to do more homework and I'm sleepy. I'm also getting kind of lazy to go work out, but, I have to go because I missed this whole past weekend. I feel like I'm getting fat even though I eat salads and baked potatoes   every day. the jester food is gross. ooh, that late night food last night was so gross. It was extremely greasy. eating that stuff on a regular basis can make you really fat in no time. I hope I don't gaing those freshman fifteen . that would suck. I don't' want to gain any weight at all. I've seen too many peaple come home really fat after just a few months of coolleege. I'm really tired of typing already and I really want to stapo. I can't even spell anymore. I really hate thursdays. I have too much stuff to do on thursdays. my day is ruined at 8:00 when I have to go to economics . from then on it's jsut hell. then biology is really long. it's not a bad class it's just really loong.

"I hope I can finish this assignment in time because I am really stressed right now. I have a lot of stuff to do. I have to go to eat dinner at the house in a little bit and then I have to do my calculus homework. I dont have time to sleep or anything I have been having fun but I am so tired and I think I am getting sick. I am definitely stressed out. I have to get up to go to the bathroom. I wonder if I have met the girl that I am going to marry in the past three weeks. all of this is just so overwhelming . I am in terrible shape and my body hurts all the time. I am hungry and tired and dirty, but I know that I will be okay once I can get organized and get on top of things. I need to talk to my family ",1
"I really don't know what the heck this is all about but i guess I will just write stupid stuff that I am thinking about. I am a really slow typer and whenever I am being timed on something it makes me nervous and I mess up a lot. So, if someone is reading this I am sorry if i make a lot of mistakes. I have a ton to do toinght and i really want to go to bed early because i have a 9 o'clock class in the morning. as soon as i get finished with this, i need tot call this girl in my physical science class and get our lab assignment from her becasue i didnt have my book last time. that is going to be really difficult because i don't have her number. hopefull i can call around and get it form somebody. She is in my sorority so it isnt completely hopelss. my roommate is watching this movie that is really gettign on my nerves. the people are making these shorrible dieing noises. it sounds so gross. anyways, back to my to do list for tonght: after i do that i need to go pick all of that stuff up and tranfer all of our data to my book which will take forever and i have only been writing for 6 minutes and i really feel like this is a waste of my busy night but thats ok a t least i am getting it over with. I am so glad that is due this friday. for some reason i had it written down that it was due last friday and i was really mad this morning when i thought i had missed turning this in. because these are easy points that i definately need. i love classes that give you extra things besides tests because i am not always te best test taker, so anything extra really helps. i really like peenebaker a lot, except he goes really fast through the material and i get kindof lost, but thats why i like the discussion sessions. i really think that those are going to help me. i am froma small high school and so i am used to small classes so those discussions are very comfortable for me. i am from midland and i think on the first day that he said he was from midland but i couldnt really hear him. i know he made a comment about midland vs. odessa an i  liked that one. i hate it when people always try to lump them together. it really gets on my nerves because they are so different. i went home to midland this last weekend because i got ina wreck on friday night. it really sucked because that was my fiirst wreck. i just backed into someone so it wasnt a big deal nut i think that it is going to be really expensive. it is getting really hard for me to concentrate because i am listening to one of my roommates talk ont eh phone and i keep gettig distracted and wanting to type what she is saying. oh my ogsh- its only been 13 miutes. this is insane. i don't know how much more of this i can take. my wrists are starting to hurt. oh now he getting off the phone. now i got really distracted because she was trrying to talk to me and now i have totally lost my train of htought which hass probaba;y defeating the whole purpose of this writing assignment. oh well. see now i can't think of anything to talk about. oh yes about going home this weekend. i had a wreck so i went to show my dad my car and ( i just got distracted again) and i went to my sisters football game. she is a cheerleader and this was her first varsity game to cheer at. she is a sophomore. i remember my first varsity game. i was so nervous. i was a freshman though. my year they let freshman try out for varsity bacuse of some conflicts the year before. so me and one other girl were the only girls ever to be on varsity for four years. it was kindof cool. i letter four years in a row. i was the only one that graduated a four year letterman because karah(hte other girl) quit her senior year. it was really sad. oh yeah i only have 30 more seconds left. i am so glad that this is almost ov        ",1
"She kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  It kind of put things into perspective for me because I wouldn't know what I would do in her situation. well now that I am back in Austin I try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that I necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people I am with right now are bothered because I am using their computer and I don't want them to see what I am typing, I usually feel this way with anything I do, I don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that I  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . I have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. I am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because I always hold back my thought and when I want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that I work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. I don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and I feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. But they tell me not to worry about so I tell them not to worry about me, I also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that I   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now I'm just tired of being a burden I know what I have to do and  I am going to do it. I have done this type of assignment before, I once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when I said that I was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when I  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes.

"i think that the only reason college is as hard as everyone says it is is because they do not want to look dumb in front of other people. I came here thinking that I was in for it but all my classes seem not too difficult with a little bit of reading and work, but then again when people ask me how it is I can pretty much, no clearly see myself saying it is really hard you are in for it. I hate how, no I like the fact that my brother knows a million people no really by a million I mean a million but a cannot stand the fact that when I meet them for some reason after I am introduced by my name and then a relation of his people do this kind of weird double take and say oh YOU are his sister as if they have or had heard many of incidents and or events involving me it makes me a little uncomfortable more so with the males than the females though sometimes I think that the whole world does in fact revolve around the way people look (although when asked the whole world denies it) as if they do not judge or insinuate on the appearance of others I wonder what people think of me I have been told many of times that I fit the idealistic look of that of a rich snob, almost brat like appearance which is then reversed though my personality I would have never thought people would think of stuff like that about me I am highly, no I would say extremely satisfied with myself appearance, social class, and moralistic views though in the least conceited manner possible I do not understand sometimes the way males think though  especially after a few or more drinks I cannot wait until I can buy my elephant a real live circus if you will in my own back yard I am starting to think though that I might have to settle for an elephant shaped pool instead I have never really believed in love at first sight or that someone was ""made"" or ""meant to be"" for you you just find someone you can make it work with otherwise why do so many people get divorced and remarried multiple times before or ever finding the right person it irritates me that people think that you are interested in them in a relationship type of manner when you simply look at them, I look at everybody if the door opens I turn around and see who walked in I highly dislike immature people and seem not to understand why certain people are the way that they are I mean I know experiences and relationships have shaped their past but I have many faults in my past and have dealt with or lived with the one person I actually can say I hate I am the least bit negative though and am equally open to everyone that is introduced to my knowledge I like being open minded it enables people as well as myself to look at views and people in an entirely almost inhuman perspective I recently also noticed that nothing really stresses me out or makes me scared or nervous I never stress out why bother stressing about it which also wastes valuable time when the time can be using in a calm cool manner completing the task I just as similarly cannot think of anything that makes me nervous or scared I do not have a problem talking to extremely large audiences nor am I afraid of death I do not understand why people pass out bibles on campus either although I am not christian I went to a catholic school which helped me learn to respect other religions as well as traditions and practices so I cannot throw the bible away and I do not want to leave it anywhere because it is the word of someone else's supreme being ",1
"I think that I am a pretty friendly guy who is fun to hang with but no one ever calls me. I don't know if its because I get decent grades and look studious that they figure that I won't want to do anything or if its just because they don't like me and they are just pretending to like me. I used to think that I had good judgement of people but after finding out that all my friends in high school basically used me in class and ignored me outside of class, I have questioned in from then on. My quest to find a good group of reliable friends always seems to come to a dead end. I look at both of my sisters who are always getting calls from their classmates and friends and I never get any. They don't help much either because they are always reminding about the fact that I have no friends. I know people and I say hi to them in the hallways and class and they talk to me normally in class but outside of class I have no touch with them. I admit that I have done the best of job of keeping in touch with anyone, but I've started to this year but with no results so far. I always end up doing the calling and asking what people are up to. No one ever calls me. It just makes me mad. While people are complaining about all the junk mail and excess mail they get, I basically hoping or looking forward to getting one message per day. Lately, I think I'm so obsessed with it that I religiously check my e-mail hoping that something new happened. Other than that everything so far is going well. I've already joined a couple of clubs, got some leadership positions and will be volunteering. My resume is starting to shape up. Now if only my grades would follow, a decent grade on the MCAT would give me an excellent chance of getting into a decent medical school. Before none of these things bothered me before, even in high school. Just like in high school I see other people doing things and never cared that I never did. But once I came to college, it just started bothering me. I don't know if its my sister's influence or what its become a problem that last year kept me from doing good in my classes. Whether its same or not this year, I'm not going to let it ruin my grades. I hope to get a 4. 0 from now till I graduate. I tried talking to people, opening up about my problems and things like that because some people told me that I was to closed and that they didn't feel at ease with me because it looked like I was too serious. Everyone that knows me never seems to think that I'm serious. They don't think that I give a care about anybody or anything but myself. I don't mean to come of that way but I'm just good at expressing my emotions. When I do, the response that I've gotten from others is that I'm stupid if I can't even figure it out by myself. I figured maybe I caught them at a wrong time or something and would try again but same thing happens. After a while I feel like I'm starting to bug them and just let it go. I think that I am a good listener but no one ever tells me about their problems. I think they think that they can't trust me or won't be able to help them. I wish they would because I truly do get a rush out of helping people for some reason. I'm not saying it because I'm egotistical or overwhelmed by myself but I really do enjoy helping others. If I didn't become a doctor, I really wouldn't mind becoming a teacher. I don't know if its because I get to showcase what I know and understand or if its because I just enjoy making someone else understand but I just like it. I would hate it if it was an ego thing, because I always tried to fight against the ego thing. Sometimes I can be at certain moments but later after I think about it I usually apologize for my mistakes. Most people get on me about being egotistical but if they ever looked at themselves objectively they would find that they have a greater ego. If I point that out to them they'll just ignore and say that I am wrong and give me longer lecture on me being egotistical or something else. I try to use their own words, conversation, statements examples whatever but they just deny it. I'm not strong willed enough to continue the argument so I usually give up. I lose a lot of arguments. I think that humans generally think that if they win an argument then they must be right and not necessarily because they just talked more than the other person. I find or observe a lot of ironic things about humans and wonder how the things can co-exist. I find them very interesting. Just the possibilities even the slightest that something every is against is actually the right way. When I try to discuss this someone else, they just look at me as if I'm just crazy. I have a lot of curiosity and like to explore but at my own pace and not at societies beckoning. Maybe that's why I have a hard time fitting into society. I haven't found a group of people yet that are categorized as me or have the same ironic interests, at least ironic according to societies view. I'm a mix of several things both culturally and socially. Well that's about 30 minutes now think I'm going to go on to assignment two. ",1
"Now I've really come to see that life would be much better once you're gone. This is a good song. Only girls like it though. Bye Bye Bye. Fool for you. I don't feel this way about Jason at all. I am really in love with him. I can't let my parents know. I don't like hiding the way I feel from them but they would never like Jason if they knew I loved him so much. I am looking at our picture right now. That is the picture that I looked at the whole time I was in Europe. He looks so good but it seemed like I almost forgot what he looked like after a month. Just looking at that picture wasn't enough. I'll never be able to tell him what happened. I love him too much. If I really love him that much, would I have done it? I think it was something I had to do to get that nasty feeling to go away. I don't regret anything. I still can't get adjusted to this new college life. I guess it will take more time. I know I'll love it soon. I always want Jason to be here when he's not and when he's here I feel like he's tying me down. He is really understanding about my adjustment though. I jut hate it when he gives me a guilt trip. He also thinks he superior to me too much. Whether it be with sex or life experience. He has experienced more than me but there are a lot of things that I know better than him. He doesn't think that. That is all the complaints I have about him. God, I am totally in love with him. What did he do that captured me? His looks defiantly were the reason at first. He feel in love me much sooner than I fell in love with him. I'm still catching up and now I am put in the setting where I have a lot of other options. I still choose him over anyone. There isn't another guy that has all his qualities. I have defiantly not seen anyone as hot as him. He's gorgeous to me. I miss my parents. I wish I didn't have to so secretive with Jason around them. They know how I feel, just they don't know how much. It bothers them already and they don't even really know. How am I supposed to tell them? I want them to get along with him. I think someday they will  once they realize how I feel they'll support anything I decide. Looking at Jason and me compared to Erich and Lisa is weird. I can't see how Lisa loves Erich judging by the way they fight. They'd never make it. Jay and I never fight unless it's over something really dumb and then we forget about it two seconds later. Maybe its cause we don't see each other as much. That is going to change because we're so much closer. Lisa and Erich fight more now that they're apart. It sucks for her and me for that matter because I hate the way she's always upset. It will end soon and she'll get over it. ",1
" It is a rainy  grey day and i am enjoying just hanging out around   my house. just lazing around feels good. the print on my computer   has broken. I tell you what there is always something. more money   more money. i have always worked and being unemployed feels so   strange and makes me feel like  I'm walking on a tight rope. I hate   the feeling of being cheap and worring about money. but so it goes   the money chase. I will be getting back to work very soon. Its been a   strange summer hit over and over.   It feels so good to see Scott out of his brace!Man he took that whole   thing well. I think we both took it very well. Its hard to see someone   you love in pain also it can be plain hard just being around   someone who is trapped in a brace. i know it would have been a   nightmare to kick-it with me in a back brace! I would have been a   emotional rollercoaster. anyway we made it through those 3 months   pretty well. Free again,yes!   my house always seems to become a mess, I just cleaned a day   ago.  It's been along time since i just sat down and wrote. I never seem to   keep up with a journal  I only write in them when I'm sad or   depressed. What a shame i could learn so much about myself . my   grandmother says you just have to force yourself to write a 2 pages   a day. Speaking of my grandmother i need to write her she is such   an amazing women. i feel guilty because i have gotten 3 letters from   her and still have not  written. ok,ok, don't talk about it just do it! Less   talking more doing. That is so like me, I'm working on it but I love to   talk about the things I need / want to do instead of just going for it. like   working-out its silly . Ok I am just yapping about nothing and already my time is out. ",1
"Ok so what am I doing right now?  This is really weird, I've never really had to think about my thoughts like this and actually record them. I really don't want to be writing this right now. I would rather be watching Bring It On"" with my roommate right now. Man I am so tired. I would also really like to go to bed right now and the sad thing is it's only like 7:30. I really haven't been getting too much sleep here. I've been too busy. Man my whole body just hurts because I'm so tired. Even though I'm so tired I know I won't go to sleep till late. Why do I do that?  Man I'm so distracted right now. All I want to do is watch that movie. I'm hearing the scene right now and I don't even have to see the picture because I know what is happening because I've seen the movie so many times. This dorm life is so different for me. I'm use to being able to get away and escape in my room, but I can't do that here. It's weird I always have someone around, whether it's my roommate or a friend from down the hall. Don't get me wrong I love having people around all the time, it would just be nice every once in awhile to have some alone time and reflect on some things. But I doubt that will happen anytime soon. I can't get the fact out of my head right now that I'm so tired. I really should take a nap or just go to bed. But that won't happen. I really miss some of my friends from back at home. It's so different because I went from seeing my best friends everyday to now barely ever seeing them or barely ever talking to them. I told myself before I went off to school that I wouldn't let this happen but it has only been about three weeks and I've already let it happen. That makes me sad. My friends back at home were such a big part of my life and now it seems that they are almost being replaced. I've meet some awesome people down the hall and I really enjoy hanging out with them. Man I can't concentrate. The movie is so distracting. See right now at home I wouldn't be typing here with all this sound. I would have gone into my own room and been able to focus. But I've realized that in college you really can't do that. Right now my roommate is blow drying her hair, that is also distracting me. I need some peace and quite sometime. But that rarely happens. I'm so excited about the football game this weekend and the fact that the weekend is coming up. I love not having to worry about classes and I love being able to relax and really enjoy myself. That kind of makes it sound like I don't have a good time ever but I do I just love the weekends. My roommate is laughing at the movie and I just want to be finished with this so I can watch it with her. I'm really happy that my roommate and I are getting along so well. I really had my doubts when I came to school with her. But it has been great so far. Watch that all of the sudden change because I'm talking about how good it is right now. With my luck something like that would happen. The hair dryer started up again. I really do have trouble focusing with all the sound around me. The people down the hall are so noisy. They play computer games till all hours of the night and yell so loud at the screen. I really don't understand that. Nothing can be solved my yelling at a stupid screen. It's like the same idea of yelling at the t. v. during a football game. It's so stupid. But people will always do it. ",1
"As I sat down to start typing, my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment. A lot of times, I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings. To be perfectly honest, I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like, all the good times, all the bad times, the lessons I've learned and through which ways I learned them. I must say I am definitely a thinker, and someone who dwells on the past. Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time. I really miss my ex-boyfriend, who was also at one time my best friend. It's like I am missing a huge piece in my life. I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time, thinking what if, and if only I had done this differently. The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently, I guess the feelings just weren't there anymore and the basis of our at one time Ð great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us. Yay, my favorite television show is on, well one of them anyways, 7th Heaven!  From watching that show, I become relaxed and more open-minded. The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts, very useful in life and this day in time. I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much. However, watching this show makes me somewhat hungry but I know if I eat, I will get sick to my stomach. Eating is a major thing to me, partly because I am very self-conscious about my weight. Up until I got into high school, I never worried a whole lot about what I looked like or weighed, but freshman year hit me and I became paranoid. I saw three doctors at a time back during my sophomore year in high school after getting Caught doing what I had been doing. Of course my parents were disappointed, but they didn't get mad at me, they were just worried. I saw a psychiatrist, a counselor and a Dietician. The psychiatrist and the dietician are the people who made me have a strong disliking for doctors and people in the medical field, but my counselor, she was really nice and cool and pretty down to earth. In fact, it was her that inspired me to want to become a psychologist; however, she does not know that. I would really like to one day become a child psychologist. I have always been interested in helping children. Hmm, I do believe the chicken nuggets I am fixing in the oven smell so good. I cannot wait for this weekend to come; I am going back home to see some friends and I think my friend Adam and I are going to a football game Friday night, and then Saturday night, I get to race, which I am pretty excited about. We didn't get to race last weekend because it got rained out, which sucked, but I got to hang with my friend later that night, so it was okay. Wow, I just realized that I went from feeling down about missing my ex boyfriend/best friend to thinking about this weekend and the fun I had from the previous weekend, and I just remembered about my hand. There is something wrong with it and I'm not sure what it is, but it hurts. I have a bump on it and every time I move my wrist downward, something pops over it to the left and when I bring my wrist back up, that thing pops back over to the right. It is really gross and hurts, but luckily, Friday, when I go back home I am going to the doctor to get it checked out. It's crazy how your thoughts so quickly change and you don't even realize it. Wow, its been over twenty minutes already and it doesn't seem like I have typed very much.  ",1
"This will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. Typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something I'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  Brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at UT were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at UT. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, Poesis and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment. There was a young girl who was enchanted with this actor that people put her impassioned essay towards the man up on their web site and voted her fan oif the week. At first, her writing started out very structured, in fact, it seemed almost hesitant. However, about half way through her writing, some flood gate in her mind broke and the emotions just splashed messily on the page. She gave up on complete sentences and punctuation and ideas just flowed from her mind in a very sad, sad stream of obsession, desperation and tears. I clicked it away feeling very depressed. She was actually in love with the actor. However, I realized just how powerful this form of writing can be--it allowed me a peek in her mind, into her passions. Reading this, I'd say my passion was homework. That's almost just as distrubing.         ",1
"Alright, today was a pretty boring day. I feel really unsatisfied with my classes because they do not stirr any special interest in me. I thought I would be excited about at least one of them but not yet. I guess I am just a little mentally tired. I was so happy to get back into the swing of things and try and find my friends. Acutally I think I expreienced a fake high because I miss Mexico a lot. I was there for the last half of the summer and made some amazing friends. I miss my boyfriend there too. I keep wondering if he is going to send me the ring he supposedly bought for me. Hopefully he will. I really want it. He told me he loves me, so I just hope he does not forget about me because I will never forget about him. he was so nice to me. All of my friends like him and besides the whole , he has two kids, thang everything is alright. I learned from him that no matter how serious skeletons in your closet might be, your heart wins overall. You cannot talk yourself out of loving someone. I guess I really cared for him more than I ever cared to admit to my roommate who thought I should of broken up with him. Too bad she ended up traveling around with some random guy around Mexico who she met before our language was over. Her guy has had at least 28 partners. If anything, she shouldn't of met her lover boy in Oaxcaca, MX. As for the rest of my dating life which seems to be my main concern these days, it is hella-active, like Cartman would say. This weekend I met some awesome guys. I am waiting to hear back from them. I can still hardly believe that I gave my number to a cute waiter at Papadeaux. I must be crazy. I usually just date around. I would love to find just one special person. I also need to workout more. I have been partying too much. Mexico was one big one month long party. Now I need to get serious about studying and try to find some interest in my classes. Everything seems to be running in circles in my mind. I am constantly thinking about boys, classes, and my friends who I really need to call and catch up. I can hardly believe I haven't talked to my closest friends in a month. it really feels good to get back in touch with them even though it is only over the computer. I am soo tired. I wish I could just take a nap and wake up stress free. All of these issues running across my mind are really stressing me out. I constantly feel tense. I hope I do not end up with some horrible health problems like my dad's family. Today at work we had to take a personality test and I scored high in a section that appearred to be Stress. I do not know what the category was but it started with an S and I am starting to stress out about even that. My body hates the beginning of school because everything feels so out of wack! Man, I already need a vacation. I am too tense for a 19 year old going on 40. Surprisingly I am not so nervous about the begining of the year but I can feel the potential homework overload slowly stressing me out. I am scared about my classes and I really need to get motivated instead of nervous. Writing down my thoughts is starting to stress me out. I am going to be so happy when I can submit this and check my e-mail. Then I can hear about my crazy friends' lives and take a break from mine. boo I have to wash my hair too and that is such a chore too. I wish I had naturally straight hair and legs as built as my dad. Then I would have hardly anything to worry about. I feel like such a basket case because I hardly voice my inner thought to anyone and I can hardly stop. I guess I usually set mine aside in order to enjoy a small vacation from my life and enjoy hearing from others. I really want to talk to my friend Lindsay tonight. She helps me forget about everything and just laugh out loud and be abnoxious without being self-conscience. My laugh is louder than the average laugh so people usually stare at me when I open my mouth and chuckle a little. I saw people looking at me tonight at dinner when I laughed. Oh well. They must be jealous, yeah right. I need to live a little. In Mexico I did everything I could ever dream of doing. I climbed a volcanoe, developed a love of horsebackriding, enjoyed my daring side, and much more. It sucks to have to slow down for school and dive into reading material I would rather use as a pillow. Oh well, my studying today will pay off tomorrow. Right? right. I need to take a nap. I did not get enough sleep last night and am drifting into lala land slowly. There is a fire alarm. I have to run. It just stopped, maybe not ",1
"this week is the most religious week in my religion. I havent been fasting like I should be. it's gets kind of difficult being in school and all . but maybe I should try harder. I mean, aren't I supposed to be responsible enough to handle things on my own. my parents sent me off to college hoping I can learn to be more responsible and independent. maybe Ill try to fast tomorrow. actually, I have been kind of bad lately. I have been eating things I should not be. and I have also been eating after dark. I wonder . how much am I going to pay for this later?  I mean in terms of sins and punishments. I am, basically, a decent human being. many other people think so. but then again, it matters what I think and if I think I am a descent person. well am I. or not?    I am . but I could be a lot better. -guess everybody can. but oh well . why do I stress about little things so much?  maybe I get it from dad. he always gets uptight over little things. man, come to think of it, I act like dad a lot. I mean I get aggravated at little things, I have, more or less, the same morals and practices. I gotta stop stressing so much or I am not gonna be able to handle college too well. it seems like I try to seem calm and collected in presence of other people, but in reality Im stressed. I seem to have a lack of self confidence. but at times, I feel more confident about myself than ever. is that uncommon?  I dunno. my lack of self confidence really does bother me. and it affects the way I am perceived by my peers. some people, like my friend *******, I mean you can just tell by the way he talks and carries himself, that is extremely confident and secure about himself. I want to be like that but I also need to be who I am, you know?  I go through phases of feeling high and low self esteem. I think my brother has a lot of effect on me. it seems like Im always feeling less confident about myself when I am around him. he has a great way of bringing out the worst in me and making me feel like crap. he does well too. butt he only does it to his family. isnt that weird?  to everybody else he is a terrific guy. but little do they know that he treats his loved ones the worst. or so it feels like it. but I never have the guts to stand up to him. why don't I. it's because Im not confident of who am and what I stand for and what I want to be. and <----- that really, I mean really bothers me. and until I figure all that out, ill continue to feel just I am feeling now, maybe worse. my brother is always in the back of my mind. if I buy a shirt, will he get mad that it costs too much, or I already had one like it, or I dont need another one. I hate him being on my shoulder in every thing I do. how can I get him out of my head. some time I wish he wasnt so smart and intelligent. then maybe he'd respect me for my own person, not the way he is or the way he wants me to be, maybe like an equal, maybe like a brother, and not a puppet. man I got some problems with myself. but I guess everyone does, right?  what make mine so much more important than others?  at least I have my health, great family, money, an education, shelter, food. where am I inside myself. I must know. Im dying to find out so I can get on with my life - with some meaning and reason. I feel chaos . ",1
"I have a feeling this is going to be a long 20 minutes. I don't even know where to start, and I don't think I really care. oh well. USC plays Florida St. tonight. I hope USC crushes them. I wish I was in California right now. Sunny skies and 70 degrees. My roommate is an idiot. I don't think he thinks before he speaks. He is the clumsiest person I have ever met. what else should I say?  I still feel sick from last night. Too much Beast!!  I've got to get replenished for tonight. Lots of good football and beer. Hopefully some bitches will be here. I smell food in the kitchen. I'm hungry as fuck. All Ive eaten this morning is Fruity Pebbles. I love Fruity Pebbles. I need more milk from the store. The Cowboys play tomorrow night at 7:00. Dallas is the greatest city in the world. Nobody does it better!!  I can't wait to get home in a month or so. I need to go to the bathroom, but I guess I can hold it in for another 10 minutes. This is a waste of time. I wonder what you people can find out from this stuff. Random thoughts are weird. My eyes hurt. I need to go to the bathroom. It sounds like Tennessee is beating UCLA. I hate UCLA. USC is the shit!!  I need to call my old roommate from USC. I need to eat. This is boring. I wonder how much time I have left. It looks like 10 minutes more. My roommate is obnoxious. He never stops talking and usually says nothing of importance. I think he has some serious problems. Maybe not. The girl next door is hot. I hope she comes over tonight to watch the UT game. She's got a great body. I'm still hungry. I need to get a job. My funds are running a little low. I waste too much money. I hope I win the lottery tonight. I hate this assignment. I guess it's pretty easy though. I better get an A in this class. I hate BA101. It is a pointless class. I need to do my assignment in there. I miss my homies in Dallas. I love kickin' it with them. You can't beat good friends and good beer. I wonder why I like to drink. It makes me feel good at the time, but I feel like shit every morning. I don't even remember when I started to drink in high school. Malt liquor is nasty, but when you're on a budget it hits the spot. Magnum. When I turn 21 I'm going to go nutty. Las Vegas here I come. only 3 more months. I better not fuck up when I turn 21. I need to keep getting good grades. Only 2 more years of this crap. I can't say that I've learned anything significant in college. All it's taught me is that you have to have one to get a job, but from there it is all on your shoulders. I like my summer job. Real world experience is better than book learning. I'm pretty sure they will hire me on after I graduate. I love computers. I guess that's why I'm an MIS major. They have so much power it is unbelievable. I need to eat. When I'm done maybe Ill order a pizza. My roommate is so loud. I'm gonna yell at his lazy ass. All he does while I'm at school is sleep and watch TV. Rough life. I need to take out the trash. I need to get some beer for tonight. Maybe something ritzy. I need to get a job. I wish all assignments were this easy. Too many classes and not enough time. I need to find a girlfriend. The girl next door has potential. It's Party Time by Tracey Lee is on the radio. It's the jam. I love rap music. The beats are great and that's why I love it. He is the clumsiest person in the world. If my window is broken I will kick his ass. What a fool. It's Party time, whoa yeah it's party time, we havin a party. Time's up. ",1
"As I sit here, I wonder what I got myself into. I came from a school of 300 people. I graduated with a senior class of 76. The University is such a huge place, I wonder if I'm going to fit in, or should I say, make my self conscious of my surroundings. It's not that I don't like my classes that I have now, or that they are already becoming a problem, but I wonder what the future holds. My birthday is today, and I am finally 18. It seems like it took forever for me to get to this point. But now that I finally made it, it's no different. My mom called this morning to wish me a Happy Birthday, and she sounded kind of sad. Her little baby girl is now 18. She asked my why it went by so quickly, but looking back, it took forever. My grandparents also called this morning. They live across the street from my old house, and I was continuously over there visiting them. She told me that she still thinks that I'm going to come through that door and ask her what's for dinner. She says it's like I'm gone for the weekend, but I'll return soon. And my grandpa, well, he's my favorite. Every time I look at him, I see all of his hard work and strength that he has put into his life. Raising 8 kids is no easy job. The day after their 50th wedding anniversary, everybody attended mass, almost all 27 grandchildren, 16 sons and daughters, and a couple of greatgrandchildren. I was going to read for the mass. I went up to the podium and I looked out there at all of my family and then looked at my grandpa. I was so proud to be a part of that. I was thankful that God allowed me to be there and have that feeling. And now when I talk to him on the phone, I get that feeling all over again. I miss him dearly. Sometimes I think more than I miss my mom or my brother. Now, my step dad, I don't miss him at all. Sometimes I look back, and I don't know how I put up with him so long. He is so evil and cruel, at least he was or is to me. He married my mom when I was 6 years old. I didn't know him that well; my mom always made me go outside and play when he came over. He was just a total control freak. Nobody in my mom's family likes him because of all the pain he's caused me over the years. From getting in my face and just yelling at me for no apparent reason, to slapping me across the face because my mom and I had gotten into a name calling fight. He's a dick, that's all there is to it. I never brought friends over to spend the night; I never wanted any guys to come over to see me. My escape place was at my grandparent's house. I would tell my dad about all the shit he was putting me through, but there was nothing he could do about it. All he would tell me was that I could come up there and live with him any time I wanted to. On weekends I was hardly home, I was usually spending the night at Holly's house, she is my best friend. Now that I'm at college, I don't have to put up with him anymore. I don't plan on coming home anytime soon. My mom and brother can come up here if they want to see me. Talking about what comes to mind is difficult. I feel that I have burdened you with all of my family problems. Don't feel sorry for me, I don't. Life is just a difficult thing to deal with sometimes.

"     well i guess the first thing or the thing that i am sort of forcing myself to now think about is what i was thinking about before. and that would be how much i miss my best friend. i was eating at Wendy's and i was really hungry because i hadnt eaten anything all day and it was already 5 by then. so i ate a jr. cheese burger, medium fries, and some orange juice. then i went bak and got a salad, frosty, and some water. but i dint really know anyone there because the two friends i came with went to a HOSA meeting so i was by myself for a while so i started thinking. and my thoughts were many but they sort of led back to my best friend Rakhi at Texas A&M. i don't really know exactly what i was thinking or what i am thinking but i know it was something along the lines of i just really wish i could spend some time with her. i guess i'll get bak to her later when i think of more. my cell phone just rang so i guess that interrupted my train of thought. and iM guessing its most probably Amit because it said   unknown   for the caller ID which most prob. means that its him because his phone is the only one that does that. Also i am really use to pushing   Ctrl S   and i can't really do that here because i am not  writing a word document - i am glad i have developed this habit because it ensures that 90% of the work i have done is saved every few minutes because i really hate having to redo work. now i guess i was just thinking of the clock. i was sort of seeing how fast it would go - like i am sort of surprised that it is already 7 minutes. i thought because of what Monique said that it would take quite a bit of time but time seems to be going by fast enough. my eyes are burning i think because of my contacts because i have gotten enough sleep since i sort of woke up at 2 o' clock today. Once again. i guess my mind - - she just called and it made me feel a lot better because i just told her that she was going to live a thousand years since i was thinking about her. and she was like   awwww I Love You   in the cutest little voice and hten i told her i had to finish this and i also have like no daytime minutes due to a family plan. and now the dorm phone rang and Arpan called. i guess we don't have too much peace and quiet in this dorm. lol. but ya it was really cool that she called. and she is stored on my cell phone as 'princess' so its really cool seeing that pop up on my phone!  Well besides i guess really wanting to see and hug her i don't know much else that i am thinking about currently. i guess maybe finding out how much a Greyhound ticket to A&M costs since i would love to go there. Well i guess i also need to figure out what i need to do for the remainder of the day such as finish my MIS homework, chek the emails from Dell, check out the Sprint family plans so i can see how to get more daytime minutes, read some Eco, go over Eco notes, read some Philosophy, and the Philosophy book, read the beginning of the Psychology book, and finish Chapter 1 of MIS, and finish reading Developing You Into Me of Ba101. wow i guess i have quite a bit of reading to catch up on. so maybe i should take care of that for the remainder of the day rather than wake up at 2 o' clock. i really need to wake up earlier and get my homework done. it would be really beneficial to me if i started doing that. Besides all that, Sid, my roommate, also suggested a movie at 9 playing for free at the Union so i may look into that. besides all of that i think i need to use the restroom after i am done with this and i don't really know why i just wrote that down besides the fact that it says write everything you are thinking about and so i was thinking about that so i thought id write it down - just like i was thinking about writing about thinking about going to the bathroom - so i did write it. now my mind is just free i guess. in regards to tom. which is Friday and now the phone just rang and now 20 minutes is over but i was just thinking in regards to tomorrow and the rest of the weekend what i am going to do - whether im going to go home or just stay here but i guess i'll think more about that later ",1
"   I'm not really sure what exactly I'm supposed to do with this. There is some guy in my room that keeps trying to talk to me and I don't know him. I wonder why he's in here. Theres a really old song playing on the radio. I havent heard it in a while. it reminds me of 6th grade. Every song does that, takes me back to a different place in time. Now this song reminds me of my friends Jason and Doug. I wonder what they're doing right now. I miss my old friends. I'm really excited about this weekend. Miami is going to be a blast. I just hope that everything works out. I really want to suprise John, but if I have to tell him I'm coming I guess I will. I really don't want to. That guy won't shut up. I'm thinking I might just take a cab from the airport to the university. My dad said theres a tropical storm. I sure hope it disentigrates before I get there. I hope everything works out with John, though. I think this weekend is going to be the deciding factor of our relationship. Things are so tense every time we talk. I want to go back to that last night at his house. . it was so amazing. We stayed up the enitre night watching the meteor shower and talking out on his balcony. one of those moments I will never forget even when I'm old. I wonder what I will be like when I'm old. I want to be a cool grandma. I want to live in a big old house on some land but drive a really badass car and cook good food for m grandkids and spoil them. I guess b efore I  have grandkids, I have to have kids. which I don't want to do. I was watching the learning channel and MAN having those babies has to hurt. I could just have a c section. Thats what my aunt did. But then she died of cancer. Maybe I shouldnt have one. This cough is getting really old. I always get colds. Last time I had one was before me and John met though. HE brought me flowers for the first time. White dasies on the red tahoe outside of my room. I miss that. The note said he didnt have any soup. flowers would have to do. I love that. If I could right now, i would fly to miami and marry this boy. i remember the day my sister got married. It was the most beautiful thing i've seen. OF COURSE I WOULD DO IT DIFFERNETLY IF IT WAS MY WEDDING&gt; OK NOW MY COMPUTER IS FREAKING OUT&gt; UMMM I don't KNOW WHAT I DID BUT IT won't QUIT! OK THIS IS GOING TO BOTHER ME SO MUCH&gt; I HATE THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU don't KNOW HOW TO FIX IT&gt; SOMETIMES THESE THINGS ARE JUST TOO SMART FOR THEIR OWN GOOD&gt; MY EYE ITCHES BUT I can't ITCH IT&gt; WIERD&gt; I WONDER WHY YOU can't ITCH INSIDE&lt; BUT IT ITCHES ANYWAYS&gt; HMM&gt; I WONDER WHY YOUR FOOT WILL JUST FALL ASLEEP ALL OF A SUDDEN AND YOU can't WAKE IT UP&gt; WHY DO THEY SAY IT FELL ASLEEP? IT SMELLS LIKE PEANUT BUTTER IN MY ROOM BECAUSE MY ROOMATE IS MAKING A PB&J SANDWICH&gt; I  M HUNGRY NOW TOO&gt; I COULDNT EAT AT OLIVE GARDEN EARLIER BECAUSE I WAS COUGHING TOO MUCH&lt; BUT NOW ITS A LITTLE BETTER&gt; I SHOULD TRY TO EAT SOMETHING&gt; I WISH THERE WAS JUST A PILL THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT WOULD BE FOOD&gt; IT WOULD BE A UNIVERSAL THING&gt; FOOD TAKES UP SO MUCH OF OUR TIME AND LIVES&gt; WE WOULD LIVE CHEAPER&lt; HAVE MORE TIME TO DO OTHER THINGS&lt; AND PROBALY WOULDNT HAVE SO MANY OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE&gt; THATS A GOOD IDEA&gt; I THINK IM GOING TO COME UP WITH ONE OF THOSE&gt;&gt;&gt; ",1

"I just had a conversation with Sarah. She can be so touchy sometimes. It seems as though she is so insecure with herself that she can't stand it when someone says something that is contrary to what she is saying. Just a few minutes before hand, I was telling her about what I need to for this writing assignment and she said that she often writes stream of consciousness"" writings and gave me an example where she a friend of hers wanted some advice on a story he was writing and in affect, she gave him a story that was just following her thoughts and that wasn't pre-planned. I told her that that was not ""stream-of consciousness"" because she was focusing her mind on a particular theme or plot to come up with a story. Then she just got irritated and told me that I don't do that to her. And I was like, ""What?"". She doesn't make any sense. Oh dear. Surat is screaming her head off and I have to cover her so she can go to sleep tonight. It is 10:30 and she usually starts screaming about now. Surat is a nice bird though, other than the screaming when she is in a demanding mood. She usually keeps herself pretty entertained. There she goes again. I should tell monica to cover her. Moni is probably busy with her studies. How am I supposed to tend to my bird while I am doing this assignment? I have to stay here and complete it or then I wouldn't really be doing the assignment right. That brings up another point. What is someone really has to go to the bathroom during these 20 minutes. Are they supposed to just sit here and risk getting a bladder infection so they may do well on this assignment? Would that be cheating if someone took a bathroom break? Ok, I had to go cover the cage but it didn't take more than five seconds(literally) because the cage is on the other side of the room that I am in. That is a relief. Now she isn't screaming. Now what should I write about. Hmmm. I had a yoga class today. Ashtanga Yoga. It was very difficult to do and very fun. I hope to become really flexible this semester. I also have a really good workout schedule planned for this semester. I got a texercise pass from Gregory gym for 55 dollars and I have access to all these cool aerobics classes and yoga classes. It is wonderful. I just wish I didn't have this psychology class at 3:30 to 5pm because two really good classes go on at that time. It is really disappointing. I can't believe I am taking a psychology class(301) this late into my undergrad. I am a senior and I am just taking this class because I decided just recently I want to go into Counseling Psychology. And in order to do that I need 4 Psychology classes with a ""B"" or higher. I am going to make an A in this class. This summer had a large effect on me. I realized that I really didn't want to become a professor and be consumed by grading papers and research and not have adequate time with my family. I think I just spelled that ""adequate"" word incorrectly. I hope this assignment isn't going to be graded on spelling. That would be ridiculous because this is a ""stream of consciousness"" paper. What if a persons stream of consciousness is going insane and causing the person to type faster than normal to get every thought down and in the process spell words incorrectly. This page doesn't have a spell checker. People are so spoiled by spell checkers and typing. Have you noticed that everyone has bad handwriting these days because no one really needs to master the art of writing? My sister told me that when she was little she used to practice her handwriting all the time so it would look nice when she would have to write papers. That seems so ancient now and that was only about 11 or 12 years ago. Its crazy how technology has progressed so rapidly within the past few years. What is going to happen next? I will tell what will happen next. We will overpopulate to the point where there will be no trees or animals left. The earth will be polluted and humans will be the cause of their own demise. I think they should study that in psychology. Why are humans the only animal that makes its environment adapt to it rather than it adapt to its surroundings? We are the only animal that is ruining earth and eating up all its resources. We are causing a great imbalance in nature. Would they even be able to study that in psychology? That might be a little taboo because everyone is so full of themselves that they don't want to admit how ridiculous humans are. or rather, can be. I really like sociology and anthropology better than psychology. Or at least I have more experience in those other two areas. I tend to take the middle ground however. I am not like a psychologist saying that a lot of aspects of human behavior is biological and I am not like a sociologist saying that every aspect of human behavior is a product of environment. I think it is a combination of both and it seems like to me that both fields are too extremist. Am I going to get a bad grade for badmouthing psychology? I hope not. Psychology is a good field, don't get me wrong, but one has to remember that everything has its faults. I took that horrible pre-test today for the experiments. Some of the questions were funny to me. I think its great that they want to know how interested a person is in erotica. Haha. My 20 minutes are over. Guess you don't get to read about my opinions on erotica. ",1
"wow I really need to shower but I'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. I don't know though but I'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should I put them, I guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. I wish I could use those but every time I go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. I'm really hungry. I was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but I mean I practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and I don't want to waste it. I forgot to go draw my tickets, I never know when to go. I should look it up soon but I can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their IDs and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, I want to sleep but ate the candy so I'd stay awake and its working I mean I'm a little tired but not too much. I went to bed around like 1 last night but I wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when I turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and I have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, I have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and I did. and then when she left it went off again and I still had an hour to sleep before I had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. I can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, I hope I can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because I have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. I don't know if I'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and I don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because I'm not meeting as many people as I'd like to, but I have only gone to like one frat so. I'm glad I met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 4 times a week, its crazy. and I have been friends wither her for like 10 years so I know she procrastinates so I hope she gets her work done. I don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 71 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone. I swear I always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when I stepped on that glass I think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. I just hope everything goes well for me I mean I really wanted a 4. 0 gpa but now I'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that I'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up.

"So, I am supposed to write about what thoughts are going through my head now, all right. I am wondering about this class, I have only heard good things about it except for the fact that it is hard to get an 'A' in it. I really hope that I can because I am trying to make a 4. 0 this semester, to start off college on the right foot. I feel like a dork because at my dorm everyone goes out every night and I stay home and read well last night I just goofed off most of the night because I couldn't concentrate. Since I don't know what to expect on our first college tests I am going to make sure that keep up to date with my school work. I had a lot of fun at the Delt Pledge party this weekend though, I was a time that I went out and it was worth it. I just saw that my clock on my bedside table is 5 minutes faster than my computer; I will need to fix that in a minute because I know the computer is right. It felt better outside this morning there was a breeze and it wasn't too hot. The football game is going to be horribly hot but I can't wait! I really need to get back into typing. I mean that I have been making a lot of typos I hope that I am catching them. I am listening to Simon and Garfunkle I love them, one of my best friends, Hilary and I used to always sing to ""Cecilia"". Hilary goes to Tech; I haven't talked to her in a while. I need to make some phone calls to my high school friends but I am sort of overwhelmed right now with school. It will be better tomorrow because I only have 2 classes tomorrow and 1 on Friday. Monday I have 4 classes, that is going to be killer! It's been nice since we haven't had a Monday class yet, though. I went to aerobics today and didn't get a very hard work out so I tried to go to Gregory but I forgot that it isn't opened until after 12:05 on weekdays because they have class in the weight room. I went to the CoOp to return 2 books but the worker told me that I needed to bring another receipt so I'll have to back tomorrow. I have been trying to stay on campus on days that I have classes with breaks that are 1¸ hours or less between classes. That makes me read and eat lunch outside and so I don't waste time walking home and back to class. It is a good plan but by the end of the day I am very tired. I like this writing assignment. It make me aware of what I think about randomly I guess that is the point of the project. I want to see the movie ""Bring it On"" it's a cheerleader movie. I heard it was corny but that I would like it I cheered in high school and so I guess it's a given that I would enjoy anything of this sort. I can't wait to watch the cheerleaders, dancers, and band at the football game I love football too. It's weird to me that the transition from high school to college hasn't been a bigger deal to me. It sort of feels like I am at camp. I like it here. Oh, it's been 22 minutes! Bye ",1
"Well I'm supposed to write and I don't really know what to say. I'm sitting in my room with my roommates while they listen to music and watch TV. I wasn't doing anything productive so I thought I'd get this writing assignment out of the way. Do typos matter? Because I keep erasing, but I don't think it really matters. Ok I left one in. So it's really hot in here. And my computer is way too far away from me and it kinda hurts to type. But oh well. I'm waiting for the cartoon Home Movies, to come on. I don't usually watch cartoons, but I saw this one once and it's really funny and I liked it a lot. Wow, only 3 minutes have gone by. I think I'm going to get pretty tired after 20 minutes. I'm so sick of studying. My roommate is talking about a little girl in a Missy Elliot video. What song is this? I have no idea. I'm hungry, but I can't eat and type at the same time. My side itches. hold on a second. Aw there we go. Much better. So I don't understand why I have so much work to do in my English class. It's ridiculous! It's making me so frustrated. My other classes give decent amounts of work to do, but that class is crazy! I have to read 22 chapters in Jane Eyre by Tuesday. Oh I like this song. Probably shouldn't listen to it too loud because I'm trying to type, but it's ok. I seem to be doing ok with it on so far. I'm really tired and I wish I could just go to sleep but I need to study some more before I do. I have to wake up early tomorrow and it really sucks. Wow, I complain a lot. I don't mean to, but I do. Ok. running out of things to say. Talk about smells. can't smell much. It's pretty plain-smelling in here if that makes sense. Damn! Only 8 minutes have passed! Twenty minutes feels like forever. We did a stream of consciousness paper in Creative Writing in high school and I remember how much my hand hurt while I was doing it. I need a massage. my neck and back are really sore. Maybe from sleeping on a too-small and uncomfortable couch last night. And from driving from College Station (no I wasn't at A&M) to San Antonio and then to Austin today. That could do it to you! Well I want a pretzel. They're sitting right next to me but I can't get them. When is this thing going to over with? I wonder what you learn from this? How weird and random people are? I think I'm a pretty random person. I used to say that word a lot in middle school. I hated middle school so much. I don't know why. It was just horrible for the most part. And high school wasn't much better. I like college a lot more than both already. Well my show should be coming on soon. I can't wait to watch it. I hope it's a funny episode! I always tell people how funny it is and then they watch the one episode that's NOT funny and think I'm stupid. Not that I care, but I want people to know that it's a really funny show. I need to be studying for English. No, not English, music. English just popped into my head. Hmm. Ok only 6 more minutes. I think I can handle this. Wow, it got quiet in here. And really really hot too! At first our A/C was broken and our room was 60 degrees, and we complained that it was too cold. And now they fixed it and it's soooooo hot in here. Katie just discovered Longhorn Delivery. I love that thing! I used to use it all the time when I used to come visit friends in Austin. We were all pretty lazy. I'm becoming less lazy here I think. I have to walk everywhere and can't really rely on other people to do things for me like at home. I want to go home and get some things and see my animals and my parents. I'm not homesick, but it'll be cool to see how things have changed since I left. My parents have been re-doing the house, probably out of boredom. I think it's cute that they're doing little projects together now. I hope they have fun living together alone again, like before they had me and brother. I've been warned it's almost 11:30 and HOme Movies will be on shortly! I'm excited. I think it's sad to get so excited about a cartoon, but you have to get excited about something! Well my time is almost up aND  I'm glad. Oops, I hit the caps lock for a little bit. Ok 10 seconds. And I'm done! ",1
"I really could care less that I'm doing it at this moment. However, I care about my grade in the class, so that is why I am typing. Lately I've really been curious about the UT environment and atmosphere. It seems to me that everything that an authoritative figure has to say is always an understatement of what is actually expected. For example, one of my professors indicated within a span of less than ten seconds that we should read over chapters one through four for the next session. When I got back to my dorm room I opened the book, thumbing through the chapters, and realized that this man expected the class to read a total of one-hundred and fifty pages in two nights!!  I don't consider myself lazy, but this seemed like quite an astronomical expectation for such a subtle suggestion. College life seems to be okay. I have a lot of free time, but when I really think about it, time flies so quickly that my free time is gone. I like my math class but can't stand the discussion lectures. I feel that they are a complete waste of time, until we actually cover material that I haven't seen. When this occurs, I'm really in for it because I'll be forced to attend the lectures. I really have a hard time understanding the TA, because he gets so excited about math that he talks too fast. People who get excited about math should do the world a favor and jump off a cliff. Just kidding, don't come searching for me because I said a morbid thing like that. My sense of humor is pretty violent. I like it when people have desensitized themselves enough to understand and enjoy that sense of humor that I possess. There is nothing that I can't stand more, however, is someone that totally does not understand my sense of humor and thinks that I am some sick individual. Typing for twenty minutes really sucks. I think I am getting carpal tunnel disease. I've never experienced so much pain in my wrists. I think I am going to slit them right now. with a dull razor blade. Then I'm going to cut my arms off and beat my roommate over and over with them. Once he has experienced maximum horror, I'm going to chop off his leg and leave him there to wither and die and horrible death. Then I'm going to go dive off a bridge onto I-35 and do triple somersault face-plant onto the oncoming traffic. Hopefully I'll traumatize someone in the car and cause them to go off the deep end. I'm just kidding. Would never do such a thing. Anyway, classes are going pretty good, I'm getting a real good taste, as a Freshman, of what college life is all about. I really enjoy having a mission or goal if you will, to get to class, and actually completing it on my own without parent supervision, or guidance, rather. In general, I enjoy the individualistic atmosphere here. However, I have become quite disturbed with the fact that no one talks to one another, perhaps because of pride, shyness, commitment to fulfill an independent lifestyle. Whatever it is, I'm troubled. I have repetitively made eye contact with numerous females on numerous occasions, but they don't look back. I smile but they don't respond. what a bunch of robots. I've never, ever, ever, ever had trouble communicating with the opposite sex before. New challenges await me. Oh well, time's up, hope you've had fun over-analyzing me. Oh wait, my name doesn't really matter, I'm just another statistic, or another number. Got to get used to it. ",1
"I feel cold, my toes are really brittle feeling, I want to get in my bed right now, it is so warm in there, I feel closest to home went I am under my covers trying to sleep, the best feeling ever in the world is being really cold and then jumping into a warm bed that is what I want right now, if my new dorm wasn't so cold I wouldn't be rambling about this topic but wow is it cold although I do enjoy is freezing at night during the day I wouldn't mind a little heat I mean come on now at camp all summer it is so warm I just want to burst every time I walked outside I got that amazing warm sensation over my whole body I remember it so clearly that thawing feeling well I who'll get my hopes up here I am now in college in the cold away from friends and family and camp but I shouldn't feel so isolated sitting in this cold and unhomely room well I should this place is absolutely depressing ha-ha that is so funny how in class we talk about depression and more sleep is associated with it and I totally know that I will be napping after this assignment but no really college is the time of your life or so I am told but so far my two weeks at ut have not been the greatest of my life but then again I have herd stories about people coming here and not liking it for awhile and then they magically start to have fun this is not a cry for help by the way you know the one you warned us about not writing because it would not be read well that is not what this is I am just thing about me and how different I am it is strange the qualities I posses I always think that I am unique and different but there are a million people out there one has to be like me but the more I think about myself the more I am convinced that there is absolutely no one else like me on one side I feel lonely but realistically I love my friends because of the differences between us I feel like all I have is me with your best friends you can tell them anything in the world about how you are feeling and you can trust them and now all those people are gone and when I talk to them on the phone it is just not the same and we seem to be growing a greater distance apart wow I just realized what a sob story this is this is not a cry for help at all what roommate just walked in and totally broke the sob story train I mean he is a nice guy and all and we will get alone fine and everything for a whole year but I definitely don't think that we will be best friends or anything and I really am not going to make a conscience effort to befriend anybody I am quite satisfied all by my self in this way I am really different I mean yes all people need to belong to the group and have friends and fit in but I think that I just have I stronger resistance to such social things as that besides a lot of people have told me that they were never friends with their roommates but that they did have a lot of fun with them so maybe I should be more open to the idea of hanging out with the guy even though he reminds me of a phony awe Holden cawfield I can't say phony without thinking about Holden cawfield from catcher in the rye I really shouldn't have read that book at the age I did it turned me on in weird ways and I don't think I understood ",1
"Hmmm. stream of consciousness. Follow my train of thought. I guess I can say I've had experience with this in that I used to, and still do sometimes, write down stuff when I just had to get something off my chest. I followed my thoughts and emotions. It helped me a lot to get through some things. I had never really done anything like that until this past summer. I guess it was because I hadn't had anything bother me so much until then. But anyhow, I am not about to tell you about my experience; that is personal. I find it strange that I never really liked to write, assignments for example. I found it so boring and pointless. But now I realize that many authors write for pleasure, for entertainment, or to simply get something off their chest. But I guess you learn as you go. So far I feel I'm doing ok in following my thoughts, which have been pretty much superficial. Anyhow, I'm here completing an assignment, and complete it I shall. Besides, there are no right or wrong answers. Now, I'm just looking at the keyboard because my mind has gone blank. I thought this assignment would be easier for me seeing that I've had experience in writing my thought without planning ahead, but I didn't think I would have this much problems in having a subject to write. I just thought of something. It is something I had thought about during the summer, while I was going through the experience mentioned before. I feel that many people skip the thought process and just act with what they feel. I do agree that it is important to satisfy your emotions, your feelings, and your desires, but there must also be some thought put into a decision. Without this thinking process, a person could get him or herself into a lot of trouble. For example, if for some reason Person A decides he feels like killing someone, he could get into a lot of trouble for doing it. If he thinks about it ahead of time, he will see the dark road ahead. He will realize that he is just being crazy and that satisfying his feelings could cost a lot. And yet, I find it hard to believe that some people, some of whom I know personally, don't use this process. Take for example many teenagers. They got out with friends. They get drunk and end up crashing and in the hospital, if they are lucky to be alive. Had they thought about the consequences, chances are they would have realized that getting drunk was not worth it. But then, there is also an ""evaluation"" that takes place when this thinking process is used. In the case of the teenagers, they are probably aware of the consequences of getting drunk and driving. I mean, they see it everyday through various media. They probably realize that the consequences are pretty bad; yet they choose to go ahead and drink. They are willing to take the risk. They have decided that getting drunk is more important, or at least worth the risk, than their lives. It's probably that stage in their lives when they feel immortal. When they feel invincible. I was a teenager once, but never did I do the things that many others did and still do. I consider my life to precious to waste on one party. I have just made an evaluation after the thought process. I have found throughout the years that I tend to hold myself back on certain actions. I feel like doing something, I want to do it, but yet, my mind says ""Stop. Is it right?  Is it good for you?  Is it ethical?""  etc. , etc. I consider many things before actually making a decision. Although my feelings and desires might be held back for a while, I know that at least my life remains the ""right"" track. You will notice that my college experience will be a little different from other students. Twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds have gone by, so I guess that's time. Hope you enjoyed!!! ",1
"Wow, that psychology chapter is really long. I am so mad at myself for letting myself get so far behind already. Hello, it's only my third week of school and I am already more behind than I ever want to be. I wonder if typing on my computer bothers Gina as much as it bothers me when she does it. Do I have enough selfdiscipline to make myself catch up on all this stuff or am I just going to keep procrastinating until I absolutely have to get it done, like the night before a test. I really hope I can make myself catch up because then I can go out and have fun and not have to worry about what I have to do when I get home. I don't know why I let that bother me so much. Last night, I wasn't really having any fun at all and they all said it was the funnest party of the year. I wonder if it's because I didn't get completely wasted or if it's because I don't like their idea of fun, or if I was just in a bad mood. And why would they think there's something going on between me and Gerardo. EWW! I mean he's nice, but come on. I thought this wasn't going to be like high school. Shouldn't I be able to be friends with a guy without everyone thinking there's something going on between us? Eww! Oh, well. I hope I have more fun with them soon. I would hate to have just joined this organization that they all seen to be totally into and me just not like it at all. I want to be able to gush about how much I love it to all of my friends and family back home and the ones here. What if it turns out I hate Longhorn Singers? That would really be a shame. What if I can't find any organizations I can really get into here? Like the whole dance thing. I looked at UT Dance Team and they looked like a drill team trying to dance with really bad choreography. And the Roustabouts just seems a little too provocative for me even though I think jazz is so fun. Why does it have to be all about sex (as Bryanne says) I really want to take some kind of jazz class because I need to expand my horizons so I can move to New York or Los Angeles and be a dancer on Broadway or a backup dancer for some music artist or in someone's music video. Would it be great if I could just dance and sing and get paid enough money for it that I could live comfortably? If that was guaranteed, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wonder if this is what I'm really passionate about. All the advisors and professors here keep telling us to find something that we really love to do. I mean I have so much fun when I dance and perform in front of people and to just learn new dances and watch myself in the mirror all day would be paradise to me. It would just be fun a job of pure fun. But, come on, who really gets to do what they really want to do. Who really wants to be a lawyer or a garbage man? People do what they do to make money and I think that's so sad, but I'm one of those people, too. Money is important to me. It doesn't rule my life but it is definitely a factor. I don't want to work my butt off at something and not get paid what I deserve or what I've earned for it. And our society is just completely out of whack. Why do basketball players get paid millions of dollars and still miss free throws? Why are teachers so underpaid? They should be some of the highest paid people in the world, I think. Because of them, we are able to learn. We would be nowhere without our teachers. That's such a shame. It pitiful that our society is that out of touch with reality. Just look at Hollywood. What a mixed up place that is, yet it looks like so much fin to me. I would love to be famous. To have everyone in the world or at least in the country know who you are and idolize you and you be a role model to them. That would be a blast. All you would do is socialize all day and make the occasional movie here and there or pose for a few magazines. Go to awards shows, and travel. I want to travel so bad and learn all different foreign languages. But I don't want to learn them part way. I want to be fluent in the way that I don't use words in the wrong context so that people in that country think I'm stupid like we do when someone can't speak our language correctly. I wonder what that would be like to change cultures. No one would know anything about you or your past. Like Ludwig. You could be a total loser/reject in our society and be a heartthrob/most popular kid in school in another country. And you're kind of mysterious because no one knows any thing about you. ",1
"     Stream on consciousness, this is something I have done before, when I was writing my diary, I though it'd be a cool idea, I wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend. He's a good guy, I miss him sometimes, well I do but I don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like I know I do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything I wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though I'm not sure, I guess well last a long time, I mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until I really think about it. then its much longer. even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow. you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all. I tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but I always inevitably move on, I wonder if that's what veryone's like. if they all reflect on their thoughts like I do, then move on. or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next. there has to be someone like that, somewhere. maybe in china or some other country, but some where. I refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 99% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not. That's just the way I think. Ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach. I'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use. Woah, a mental stumble in words, I wonder how oftne I do that? I don't think I realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- I like foreign languages. rightnow I'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one I'm most versed in. I think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and I have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own. I used to think when I was a little kid that that would be impossible- then I though itd be incredible, now that I can do taht it just seems like fun, I like it, it feels. Comforting somehow. I'm not sure why. it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though I'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven. I find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of. Medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when I was younger. I suppose I've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life. its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time. perhaps only to point me in another direction. (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, I wonder why. maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out. I wonder if there's a pattern. (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern. not lit. lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well. worth a shot. I search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like. that one police officer told me I sounded like a doctor. he asked me what I was going to ut to be and I said I was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said ""You sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak"" I though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical. I am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when I say them they come out right, and not only that but I love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen I'm in an argument I try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all. for instance I try to see what the ohr person is saying and why. what makes them say that. why they say it the way they do- I'm going to like this class- I like psychology. psych= mind. ology= the study of. I was in medical terminology. actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, I worked at the hospital but instead of money I got grades, particiapation grades reall. it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross. I enjoyed it- but I don't think I want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital. I think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push. they stick a little, on some letters more than others. they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser. they're not quite tahat stick at all. but still they seem so loud. The guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- I like orange soda. its my favorite color and soda, good stuff. I wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble. if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings. just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read. I wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like. what type f people they are, if people really do have type. basically, what they're like inside. ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am I really one of them? I kind of think I might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other. maybe I'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water. ",1

"I am sitting here trying to start writing, but I can't. I have this problem a lot when writing for my english class, because I never do the reading. This year, however I decided that I would try doing the reading assignments, and it has helped me immensley in my classes. However, now that I am doing the reading in my chemistry class, I see no reason to go to class, because my teacher doesn't understand the concept of teaching, so I basically learn nothing. I often wonder if I am too hard on teachers because I want to be one. In my classes, I always seem to evaluate the teacher so I can figure out what to do and what not to do. In high school band, I spent a great amount of time evaluating my band director because I had such a problem with her teaching techniques. I see music education as a field in which you should be a teacher, not a technician. My band director was not a teahcer at all, but only a technician. We never learned a single thing about music, but she was great at teaching kids how to play instuments. My ADD is kind of annoying at times, because I will be trying to concentrate on one thing, and my mind wanders off to another place. I am thinking about this girl in my music theory class who is very good looking. I think I am going to ask her on a date this weekend. I am not sure what I am going to do though, because my father would not let me take my car to school. Sometimes I think he trys to get out of things by procrastination so he can save money. I mean, he gives me everything I need and most everything I want, but I feel that he is trying to make me think he is going to do one thing, and when the time comes he just finds an excuse to not do it. I have tried, however to start holding him to his commitments. Part of the problem is the fact that he trys to do too much in a 24 hour a day, 7-day a week week. He never pays anyone to repair anything for him. He does it all. cars, house, electronics. I am glad, however that I have grown up knowing and learning how to do repairs from such an extremely intellegent man. I'm sure it will come in very handy one day when I have a house and family of my own. In fact, it has made me want to have a house of my own so I can have something to work on of my own. I'm excited in general about my future. I want to be a music educator, teaching orchestra. I love music education and orchestra so much, but I sometimes wish I was getting a piano degree, as it is my first love. I have taken piano most of my life, and I greatly improved this year, mainly in the past 3 months. I sometimes wonder why I smoke cigarettes, as it is a stupid habit. Why would someone willingly put smoke into their bodies. I guess I enjoy it. i don't know. Most of my friends smoke mariajuana, and it doesn't bother me. I, on the other hand, have never done it, and I really have no desire to. My sister was a somewhat heavy weed smoker her first year in college, and she ended up with a GPA of 1. 9. I don't want to get kicked out of UT my first year, and I want to be able to say that is something I have  never done. My father works on top secret programs for the government, and he says that if anyone trying to get a security clearence has a history of drug use, they are automatically disqualified. I might want to someday become an engineer, and I would like to do what my father does. That is one of the main reasons I don't smoke weed--I don't want to screw that chance up for myself ",1
"     Well, I have to do this weird assignment for psychology. I think its neat, but kind of weird. that spoon full peanut butter was really good. I'm going to have to have some more later. the atkins diet is a bitch . even though you can eat all the protein you want. I still crave the bun on my buger. I was so upset this morning for leaving my cell phone in my dorm room. god, I felt like such an idiot. then I went crazy looking for my  roommate Sam cause we are supposed to meet at jester for lunch and I Couldn't find her and I don't have her number memorized. I don't know. I felt stupid. I feel so fat. !!!! even though I'm not overweight at all I just feel fat . I have this obsession with looking in the mirror all the time. I thinks obsessive compulsive or something. I feel like I always have to look my best or that part of my hair is out of place. I guess I always feel like I have to impress everyone. shut up Sam, god she makes the most annoying sounds I've ever heard. anyway. yeah I just always feel fat. I think I way around 123 and I'm 5""1. I just want be a little bit thinner maybe 5 or 7 pounds lighter. well, I'm trying to loose weight cause my friends from back home are coming to visit me in a couple of weeks for austin city limits, and I feel like I got to loose a few. they are awesome, but its kind of weird actually because they were my coaches in high school and we've just grown to be the best of friends. I'm only 18, and its weird cause one of them is 42 and the other is 30. I'm so excited cause I miss them a lot. I think its pretty cool that my coaches would drive 6 hours to come and visit. when I went down a couple of weeks ago back home, they took me out to South padre island and we all got wasted. I like it cause I can trust them and more importantly they can trust me. I have a little head ache right now. I wonder if it was the peanut butter. I hope not. I'm really thirsty. all I've been drinking is water cause of that diet. I just started it yesterday and I probably won't see any results till maybe in a few more days. I miss isaiah. I love him so much, but he's about 6 hours away and a senior in high school. I love him but the last time I went down I didn't feel the same love for him like I used to. maybe I'm just in love  with the image of him. I guess that can happen. I've been really confused lately about a lot of things especially what kind of person I am. I wanted to come to UT because it was so liberal and they actually encouraged you to be different here and no one even judges you. well, I still don't know who I am. I know that I'm sweet, kind, and talented, but there's also the me who lies to people to benefit me and bend the truth so that I don't get into trouble. maybe everyone does that. I guess I'll never know. I 'm really glad that I have a good roommate. we are exactly alike and we get along really well. I just miss everyone from back home , but I know when pam and kristy come to visit me I'll feel a lot better cause we are all going to see sheryl crow and I m so in love with her music. I recently went to  a sarah mclachlan concert on july 23 this summer. now that was probably the best experience of my life. it was awesome. their friend niguel is also coming in from nacadoches, I think that's how you spell it. I 'm really excited to meet her cause she's hilarious. I spoke to her on the phone the other night for about an hour and she is hilarious and I haven't met her in person yet, but I'm looking foward to it cause she  said she likes having a good time and I'm pretty sure we are all going to have a great time together. I CAN'T WAIt!!!!1. I'm tired now. I haven't gotten any sleep since I'v been here, wow the times almost running out,,  ",1
"I am so mad right now that I can't believe it. I wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and I pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  I am so angry and tired and I just don't feel like doing this anymore. I can't believe that I am so stupid!! Why am I doing this anyway??  It doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and I don't see what it's serving. I don't have anything to write about anymore and I don't even know If I'm doing this thing right in the first place. I don't know if I'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if Im just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if I should press enter. I don't know. I don't think I even care right now. I'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. I don't know why we put the AC on so high maybe because Austin is always so freaking hot!  Why is it so hot anyway?  I hate Texas. I wish that we never moved from NJ; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. I miss my friends too. I don't know what to do right now. or what to do when I'm done with this stupid assignment. great, I have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but I'm just really pissed right now. I'm also tired  because I went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 7 hours and I'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. How do girls do it?  How can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. In that respect I completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. I must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! I just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. I hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. I'm having trouble breathing now. My  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. I wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. She left in a hurry after she dropped me off. That's the gratitude I get for going shopping with her for so long. I bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that I can type 65 words per minute and I bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. I'd go crazy if I have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. Man I can't breath. I need to get my inhaler. I think I need to go to the bathroom too. but I can't leave this computer to do it. Oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before I am done!!  and I still don't know what to write about. Those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. OH. I wonder who won the UT football game?  I guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but I wonder what the score was. I think I need to ask someone. Not that I actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  I think we need to give some away. ouch I just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden I'm really really tired. I want to get some sleep. I never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. I need a haircut. I'm too tired to think. My ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. I can't do this anymore. I'm debating whether or not I should just submit this thing and say that I wrote for twenty minutes since I type faster than most people anyway. No one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. I can't think of anything to write. I need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time I checked. I think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell cant I just stop??!?!?!?   I'm so tired. My arms are getting heavy. I'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. Think Ill just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way I won't have to type anything. but then  again here I am still typing. what the hell. I can't win either way. I need my inhaler really bad now. I can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. I guess that's it then. I've got no more to say. ",1
"My mind keeps jumping back and forth between this year right now and like all of high school. I have such problems with sharing people and friends that my mind is constatly taking me back ana forth to times when I've been in sumilar situations. Cheaters are something I end up with a lot when I date people so the idea of sharing male friends is sdcary to me, I feel bad for being jealous of other girls who hang out with my male friends, but I can't help wondering if they are all destined to follow the same pattern as everyone else. My com[puter is broken in my room so I have to use the lab. I can't stand the noise of either bi;llion people typing at once, and the talking girls behind me are growing more annoying by the minutes. Cranky woulsd be a good wor to decribe how I feel. Reelly Really cranky. I don't know why either, so far everything has gone my way, from rush to guys to sports to school (thats what I'm here to do right?) but at the same time I'm being a total crab! I guess it's gets back to that damn jealousy thing again. I hate that part of myself, it's annyoing as all hell and I can't ever seem to get past it, the rest of my life is totally laid back, yet this is the one part that I freak out on. I can't imagine writting straight for twenty minutes. It took me three to write this, so I can't really understand how I can just blaber for twenty minutes. The sosrity girls are all really nice, the party at the delts was okay, ATO was pretty lame, but none of the new ADPi pledgees no anyone so I'm hoping that once we do some mixers or something along those lines I'll know some more people and therefore have more to do at these parties besides drink my ass off. There's an ATO bar-tab tonight at Sidestreet and a PhiSI party somewhere too, but beong a nice friend I offered to stay in with Brad who is walking on to the football team tomorrow, but he's also got three other girls upstairs, there's the jealousy thing again. Yarg. I left my shoes at the house and don't havce any comfy shoes to wear tmomorrow, sigh. The pledge retreat is this weekend, actually more likethis friday and some of saturday, so that'll be fun, but it's a little scary becasue we are all still just getting t knowone and other. I can't go to the first football game because the girl I was surposed to get tickets with ditchedout on me and I don't have a ticket, so going is not going to be possible, which sucks, becuase I really did want to go and get all involved and stuff. Good god, it's annyoing to have al this to do, I can't imagine how much time all these assignments are going to take, between this class and my theatre major-stuff, I have nooo time and am surposeds to join two outside organizations besides my sorority. If I get cast in a show, there isn't any way I'll be able to make any meetingings with any kind of consistency, but I really wantto beinvolved in everything thats going on. I have to do my laundry too. Somethings got to go and that looks like sleep, at least for the first semester sleep is going out the window until I get this grades business firgured out. Okay, ten minutes left. My room smells like stale coffee (true dorm) and chicken soup becasue retard king brad spilled soup on my floor, and we cleaned it up with paper twels, but not like actual soap, so I'm kinda scared as to what might be living under my bed at the moment. I have new momagrammed sheets that I'm way psyched to put on my bed, because they are those totally comfy jersey knit sheets, and I'm all about soft stuff. My room has turned into a pit, by the way, toaly a disaster area. Yuck-ola. My wallet has been getting fatter, but not, sadly, with money, way too many passwordsa nd numbers accounts and figures to rmemeber just to use these damn computers that run WAY too slow for their own good, or anyone elses for that matter. God damn. I tried to go ahead and do the survey so I don't acidentally forget and not doit, but the comnputer wouldn't laod it becasue I was transimiting my social security number and it didn;'t like that at all, so I guess I'll have to find a friend and mooch of them. Bad time to quit smoking. Almost done. The yamm,ering can stop shortly. Found my comfy pants on a non-cranky not, and that's wonderful becasue I could really use some good comfy pants to just lounge around in. My room looks like a laundry basket blew up on the floor and splattered everythingin it's path. My poor roommate, I don't know how she puts up wih all my shit. She just got cheated on and I feel so terrible having been in the same posotion myslef,and I wsh guys weren't such total morons about stuff like that. boohoo hormones. Two minutes left. I can't understnd my TA in math calss. He speaks english about as well as I speak french, and I know three french words. People say numbers are universal, yeah right, try sitting through a math class with a non-native english speaker as your teacher and see how universal they are come finals. Ah! Done. ",1
"I survived . . so far. I think I'll do alright in college. I was thinking today that maybe I should have gone to UTA. Oh well. I met people from Nolan today. It was great. I don't think I've said it enough but I LOVE ""Beautiful Thing""!!  It's a great movie. I know I saw Blake's name today on a sewer lid, and I wasn't being paranoid. I really should talk to Kent soon. I miss him. I was on the verge of tears telling the psychologist about Blake, Amanda, and Millwood. It still hurts. I'm afrain not to take my meds. I can't wait to fall in love. Sometimes though I get very scared that I might mess someone else's life like mine. I have quite a bit of baggage and I'm not sure if anyone will go through. I miss Amanda. Damn allergies just hit me today. Peppermint Foot Lotion. Abuelita Cuca . . I wonder how she's doing. Renata & Seehum were so cute. ""I'm going to make it afterall!""  My frog makes a good pillow. I can't wait to see Kate. She left for Rome yesterday. I realized today I don't care what I do later in life as long as I have kids, friends, a nice house, and someone who'll always love me and be there when I die. Am I going to Hell?  I still don't know. Mr. Rist would say I'm as good as damned now. Dying has so much stress attached to it. Maybe that's why I could never go through with it. I know that if I went back to a place like Millwood I'd give up and stay there forever or at least a month or two. I wouldn't care at all this time. I don't dream very much anymore. At least I don't remember them. I sleep so well during the day but it's harder at night. It's that damned melotonin crap. Commie Bastards!  Oh well. God I wish my nose would stop dripping. I miss Kate sooooooo much!  God bless her. ",1
"so I'm suppose to be writing my thoughts at the current moment. hm, strangely enough, I don't have any and usually my head is swarming with random ideas and daydreams. well, now that I think about it, I guess right now my thoughts are so scattered that I can't exactly grasp onto one idea. my friend called while I was in bio class earlier. stupid me forgot to turn off my phone before I went into the class, so imagine the embarrassment when my phone rang in a deathly quiet lecture hall. I quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone, not wanting to upset my professor. typically, I'm told, it's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class. but man, my heart raced after that. I don't know why either. but for about 5 min, I couldn't write; my hand was shaking so bad. so right now, I'm thinking I should call my friend back, but seeing as how I still have about 15 min left to write, I guess I can do that later. speaking of later, I'm still waiting for a phone call from my friend ruby so that we can go work out later. we went earlier this morning, right before lunch, but we had to stop short because I had class and all. we worked out for about an hour, and yet, that was definitely not enough. I never imagined that working out took so long. I'm terrified about the so-called freshman 15 that I want to do as much exercise as possible. it seems like I have so much free time on my hands, since I only have class for about 2-3 hours each day, and yet, I'm still rushing around trying to get everything done. it's funny how time speeds up when you're at college. I still have yet to practice piano here. and I have a billion other things to do, and yet, for some reason, I'm really bored now. my time management skills have definitely got to improve. fast. I also push myself to do something every single minute of the day, because once I start getting bored, then I get really depressed and start missing home. I never thought that would happen because I really hate port lavaca. it was so boring there. man, I'm just filled with surprises. I'm really looking forward to seeing my friend tonight. I can't wait. all my thoughts eventually drift back to him. I've managed to suppress my thoughts about him for about 10 min now. whew, that was really tough work, I must say. we don't see each other all that much during the day, mainly because he's busy, I'm busy, we're all busy. but I guess it's good. we need to lead our own lives, so in case things between us break apart, I won't be totally crushed. like the last time. I learned my lesson quite well. but still, I can't wait to see him. it kinda sucks living at jester without a car. sure I know a lot of people with cars and all, but that's different. I don't want to bother them with taking me places. I had my roommate take me to walmart today and I felt sooooo bad when we came back. I dunno, I just feel like a burden when I don't have a car. I guess I could always call up my bro but he lives about 10 min away and parking on this campus sucks. and usually when I go visit my friend, I get him to pick me up since he lives on the other side of campus and then some. but doing that every day is going to get quite tedious. I'm going to have to find another mode of transportation. I still have to figure out how the buses run too. I'm scared to ride the buses tho. I'm scared that I'll take the wrong one and end up on the 5th ward of austin. I wish I had my car. I've met some new people here, hung out with a lot of old friends too. but yet, I still feel very lonely. I mean, I'm starting to get to know my bro's friends but it's kinda not the same when everyone knows each other so well, and then this newcomer comes and tries to fit in. I guess a lot of freshman go through the same thing. I dunno. maybe it's just me. and wow, this 20 min went by really fast. I have about 4 min left. ok, so what was I saying? o yea, I think tonight I'm going to see my friend. (I told you my thoughts keep drifting back to him) it's his birthday today and his roomies are throwing him a special party, entertainment included. I don't really care about that. and surprisingly enough, I don't even care if he has a bunch of friends that are girls. I guess I'm just in a whatever mode. don't want to get too attached again. but on the other hand, maybe I'm finally beginning to trust him. I guess I'll find out later if that's going to be a huge mistake. I really like writing, esp like this. just random thoughts. I brought up my journal so that when I'm feeling some realy intense emotions, I can just write my little heart out. but that's usually only when I'm really feeling strongly about something. usually when I'm going through one of my personal traumas. ok, time's up. this has truly been fun. truly.

"MMMMM I wonder what's for dinner tonight??? I have so much crap to do before I leave to go home. Why is this print so small? Oh well, I have no idea what to get Kate for her birthday. Man I'm really having a hard time typing today. I wonder who's on im. I hope Kyle is I can't wait to see him on Saturday, and I really can't wait for the Mexican food. I need to spend time with my mom and dad and go shopping so I have clothes to wear down here. I don't want to go on that retreat. This sucks. Okay well I have another 15 minutes and my head is so jumbled up. I bet they think I'm a moron. My back hurts and I really need a nap. I don't want to write my English paper! I need to find a job here so I can have some spending money. I can't believe my math book cast me $90 that really put a damper on the day. I can't type for the life of me today. I wonder why they put a sticker of a bee on this computer. That's so random. I want to check my hotmail I wonder if anyone exciting wrote me. I haven't heard from my mom I wonder if everything's okay. I really need a nap. This whole go out every night and wake up at 9 thing is killing me. Oh crap I have to do my math homework. I wonder if it will matter if I go tomorrow. I'm going to be so exhausted. I should go grocery shopping so I can have some snack to munch on. The food here really isn't that bad. I should work out again today because I only worked out for 15 minutes and ate a huge lunch, I can't gain that freshman 15. I hope someone calls me I'm bored. That's neat that this computer capitalizes your Is for you. Only 10 more minutes. I hope Cat can get her cd burner working I really want that song it was so sweet. Man am I glad we don't have mandatory study hours, talk about adding to my stress. My eyes keep closing. I wonder if I'll see Barrett tonight. I'm stressing out about TX OU weekend. I want to be able to see my family and Kyle. I can't believe its $150 to make a cooler what do they think this is homecoming? I'm glad my face cleared up last time I go get my eyebrows waxed. I wish I were going home tomorrow. I don't want to go on this retreat. I wonder when we're getting our tshirts in, hopefully soon. Man my wrists hurt. I really need to get one of those pad things. I wonder how I'm supposed to paste this into that other site??? Yes, only two more minutes left. Wow that went by pretty fast. I can't believe how bad I'm typing today. I wonder when I can get my student ID back. I hope we actually get tickets. TIMES UP! ",1
"Today has been a pretty good day, I guess. It's Thurs. , so it's closer to the weekend, which always makes life feel better, for one reason or another. I've had a lot of homework, and I know that the fun is only just beginning. I hope that somehow I will be able to keep a healthy balance between social life and school life. So far, I honestly think I've been spending more time studying and reading for class than doing anything else. My dorm floor seems kind of rowdy at times. I just wonder how all these people can just go out and hang around and do all this stuff all the time. Don't they have homework, too? I wish that I was just really really really smart so that I wouldn't have to work so hard to understand things, especially things that seem relatively simple to many other people. I went to the SI group for Psychology today, and I really liked it, although we didn't cover much class material, considering it was our first SI meeting. However, I like the small atmosphere, and I like Anna. I think that if I have any questions, it will be easy to have them answered then. I'm starting to worry about not making new friends and stuff. I guess it will all work out in time and I'm just feeling insecure for no reason. I would like to have someone to go to the game with Sat. (today is Thurs. , Sept. 7), but my closest friend here has to work, and I haven't met anyone that I feel comfortable enough with to go together. Oh well, that will all work out, too, I suppose. I kind of like this writing thing, because it's like writing in a journal, and I think it's healthy to write about feelings and such. Sometimes I wonder what I'm supposed to be doing with my life in general. I'm undeclared in school, and I have no real idea of what I should do with my life in the future. Certainly one day I will recognize that I have a specific purpose to serve. I would like to figure that out, soon, though. Tonight I'm going to Starbucks with my roommate. We grew up together. I really like mocha and caramel frappacinos. It's really interesting to me how popular coffee drinks are now. We had a discussion about this in my sociology class. It's such a trend right now. I'm starting to get tired of writing, now. I have that irritable feeling where it's just almost miserable to sit here and do this. Well, it's really not that bad, actually, I just want to get this over with. check it off my list of things to do. My family misses me! They're very proud that I'm here, though. I hope that I can continue to make them proud. I guess that all depends on the tests. I don't even know what to expect. I just pray that I won't do that terribly bad. I'm definitely going to do my best. Okay, six more minutes. Do you know how long six minutes is when you're sleeping and about to get up? I cherish those last few minutes in bed, really I do. My mom called me this morning about forty minutes before my alarm went off. That was annoying, but luckily, I had no problem falling asleep again. I can't believe some people that have worked at the University get paid only $20,000 a year in some cases. That's incredible. I'm not sure a strike is appropriate, because students are paying money to be taught, but still I was shocked to hear that from Prof Pennebaker. Girls keep screaming down the hall and I feel like I'm nine years old at summer camp. That's weird. I've been thinking about the advantages and disadvantages of living on campus. I'm thinking that it would be easier to study if I lived off campus, but easier to get involved by living on. Maybe next year I'll try getting an apartment and see how that goes. Well, my time is almost up. Bye. ",1
"Right now I am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. In my Language of the Stage class my teacher gave my about 60 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this Friday. It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 17 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. The only problem is that I have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. It's like I wnat to make good grades in school but I also want to go out and meet new people. I am also a Pi Phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. I really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. I also need to start working out again because I don't want to gain weight and I am really afraid about that. I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately. Well I am having so much fun but I really miss my friends that aren't here. Only a couple of my friends are here but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already. ",1
"     So today has completed a very odd and trying week. I have finally gotten to sit in on a full week of school and WOW!!! I seem to find myself asking, have I over done myself? I am taking 15 hours of scool and working 30-35 hours a week and on top of all this I got TWO kittens that require a lot of attention. This, for me, seems like a heavy load because between school and work I have to make sure I am home every three to four hours in order to feed the kittens, but I love them. My roommates seem to have a qiute different approach and feel like I am way out of line and that my life is too busy to begin with to have two little lives depending on me, but what do they know? I am not trying to say I don't take their words into consideration but I believe life is what you make of it and one lives and he/she learns. This is a test for me that I hope I don't fail at but all I keep telling myself is that I must work harder if am am going to succeed( but not too hard=). I am also in the midst of wondering if my mom is doing ok. She found out a month ago that she had 3rd grade ovarian cancer, which is the most advanced cancer cell, and yesterday she had surgery. The doctor said she should be alright but I still worry. I really have no reason to write all this personal information but it feels good to let it all out. All I can conclude is that I have been set a full plate that I now must eat. Besides all the drama I just mentioned I have finnaly declared my major as Child Development/ Pre-Med with a minor in psychology. THis is a huge burden taken off my shoulders which I am very thankful for. I know it will be A LOT of work but I love working with children, but now whether I follow all the way through with Pre- Med is a different story but I know eventually I will get through it and go to Med-School. For right now I need full day just to relax and enjoy myslef, with no one there and no kittens to wake me up every three hours of the night. Another thing I am upset about( which is very trivial) is ther fact that I could have gotten two tickets the the OU game and I passed up the opportunity. There goes a couple hundred dollars I coould have gotten off ebay. Oh well, that's the way life goes. By the way, my boyfriend of three years, Zack, Took me out to a five star resturant last weekend and it was amazing. We had 12 courses in 5 1/2 hours, boy where we full and a little toasty(2 bottles of champaign ahd 12 glasses of assorted wine later). The cool thing is that he works there and our bill was only $60 =). Anyhoot I enjoyed writting and I will see you next time, bye.   ",1
"I have finally made it to college. I miss my family and friends but at the same time I am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. It's is something new. I feel confident that I will succeed here at UT, but most importantly, I want to succeed. I am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. I sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. However, each day I feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. Above all I find myself missing someone back home who I have only known a short time the most. He is a wonderful person with whom I have this extraordinary mental connection. Being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. It makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. I am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. Well I guess I will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation. ",1
"     My room is so dark and cold right now. I wish my roommate didn't like to sleep as much so that I can have lights on and have the blinds open. I call my room oppressive sometimes. But I like my roommate so I am willing to compromise for her. So far, she has proven herself to be a good person and above all, a good friend. Today, when I needed someone, she was there for me. Well, today I found out there was more to a story that my boyfriend told me. I was so hurt and tearful and angry. And I felt alone. He is one of my closest friends but I can't go to him now. And so I went to her. She was there and comforted me and gave me food, which is always a sign of good friendship. She gave me advice and stuff. But I am debating whether or not I am going to take it. See, I love my boyfriend so much. I can't see myself living without him. I don't know what to do. I feel likke he has deceived me and I honestly can't trust him anymore. Trust was the thibng that I sough in him. It was the thing that I could not find anywehre else. No one but him made trust available to me. And now that feelign is gone. I really do love him though, and I am hoping that love will get me through this, but it can only go so far. I have to think of my own feelings. I have to think of what is good for me too. I shouldn't be in a relationship where trust isn't there. I shouldn't put myself in a position where I will be hurt again and again. But on one note, this is the worst thing he has ever done. He loves me so much and cares for me so much. He wouldn't hurt me for no reason. But he didn't have a reason. well in a way he did. He didn't want to tell me the truth of the situation cause he knew I would get upset and be hurt, which is the way I am now. I just wished he had told me the truth and been honest with me. I always enjoyed how we were so open and honest with each other. Now, I feel like it can't be like that. I feel it will be like that not cause we want it to be but because he knows I don't trust him and therefore he has to be honest with me so I can trust him again. Depsite all of myfeelings for him, I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I shoudl forgive him completely, give him a third chance, or just dump him. I love him to much to let him go completely so there goes option nubmer 3 but I cannot forget what he did. It will always be on my mind. I will always recall the time he deceived me. I don't like feeling deceived. It makes me feel used and disgusted with myself. I honestly feel like curling up in bed with the lights off. But then I would be doing as my roommate does. I wonder what he is thinking now. I wonder if he is really sorry for what he did. I wonder if he cares about me as much as he says he does. I can't fathom what is going on through his head. He is always thinking about stuff. He denies it but you can tell. YOu can alawys tell with soemone like that. I really do love him. I really really do. And my heart tears every time he does bad stuff to me. But this is his first time to do anything this bad. Usually he makes small mistakes like neglecting to do something. This is big. He hid something important from me. Well. . yeah he did lie to me before. And I forgave him cause it was not really that important of a lie. It was jsut the fact that he lied to me that hurt. It breaks my trust and ruins all of the faith that I have in him. I have faith in such few things. Like, I love all of my high school friends, but I know that they weren't the best to me at times. THey would leave me out and ignore me at times. My boyfriend has always proven not to be like that. He is there for me when I need him. Maybe we should be friends instead of boyfriend/girlfriend. But we tried that in the beginning and eight months later we are in love. It is probably inevitable that if we do become friends again, we would fall in love again. Our personalities are like that. We are really good together like that. Everyone says so and I feel it. I feel a connection to him that I have never felt with anyone else. It is the strongest bond that I could ever have or ever will have. I can't tell anyone how much he means to me. If they do ask, I tell them that he means the world to me. Oh God, I think I've turned to one of those codependent girls that I've always hated. Ugh, I hope not. I hate to be like. Hopfeully i am not. ",1
"     I've been thinking about relationships lately. As we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. Im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. This new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. It's something new and I like it, but I can't help but still have feelings for my ex. I think the reason is because I was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. And I think that keeps me tied to her in a way. And the problem is when I'm with this new girl, I'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason I can not get aroused, if you nkow what I mean. It's not that I don't want to, because I do, but for some reason I'm just not able to. I wonder why this is? Why can't I just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. Is it me? What can I do to fix the problem? Should I just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? Or will this be a chronic thing? Im in a bind because I don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. I don't want her to think I'm not attracted to her. God, I can't wait to see her! She lives in Dallas still, she's a year younger, so I can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. And she has already taken advantage of me when I was drunk. Should I tell this new girl this? What good would it do? I'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me I definitley wouldn't lie to her. When I broke up with my ex I wanted to be free, I mean I was going to college and I wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. But then just a week after we broke up, I found her!! And she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. She likes me how I am, but I like to try and impress her as much as I can. I find myself spending  a lot of moeny on her! Plus, I'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but I definitley want it for her because I know she would like to see me with more muscles. She's so beautiful! Her face pops up in my head everyday. I see her face on everyone I meet! Am I in love again? I hope not. I don't want to fall in love with someone I can't be with do to where we live. That would hurt too much. I have to be close to the person i love. So I will not let myself fall in love again. I can't let it happen. But I'm afraid it will, I know she is falling in love with me, but I got to hold back. I got to be strong. I can't wait till I go back in town in october. I'm taking her out to a haunted house, I love them , she hates them. Meaning she will be clinging to me like white on bread. I love when she puts her arms around me. I love when we're fooling around she takes my shirt off. She's very aggressive. . . god I love that. An aggressive woman is very attractive in my eyes, a woman who will take control is somethign rare, and she posesses it. I so want to get more physical with her, but I'm afraid because you see, she's a virgin. . . I'm not. I don't want to steal her innocence. She's so sweet and innocent, I don't want to corrupt that, especially when I don't know if there is a definite future for she and I. What do I do? I think she wants to have sex because of all the signals she gives me when we're fooling around but I'm not too sure. Do I go ahead and go for it? Or will that just make me fall in love with her, which I stated before I didn't want to do. Man, she makes me so jealous! I have never been jealous, but for some reason she makes me. I guess it might be because I'm not there with her, and i know she hangs out with all these guys, and osmetimes its just her and a guy. That pisses me off, I mean I trust her, but one of the guys she hangs out with is an ex-boyfriend of hers, who makes it very clear that he is still madly in love with her. So how am I suppsoe to take that? god!! I wish I wasn't jealous, I mean she and I are just dating and I'm already this jealous. I was never this jealous in my entire previous relationship. She makes me so happy though. She can do nothing wrong! She is my everything and I think about her constantly! I think I love her! ",1
"     Okay, I thought right now would be the best time to do this. I'm alone and can think aobut what's going on. These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty. We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault. Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything. This is all that keeps playing over and over right now. Where did we mess up? Well the past is the past and you can't change it. My dad came down and was very disappointed. He didn't know I had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and I don't evne get drunk. I get a buzz and I'm good. I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time. For some reason he doesn't beleive it. He was furious. He's always trusted me for everything and never thought I'd mess up like this. I do good in school graduated top 2% of my class and everything. I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too. I never wanted to disappoint my parents. I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them. So they would think of me as they saw me everyday. This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people. I'm a real easy going person. The way I think is that I don't care aobut anything. I let things happen. I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen. I like to make people happy. I'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win. If they think they are right than they feel good. As for me I don't care. I know I'm right or wrong and I let it be, as lngo as their happy it's all good. So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it. I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person. Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly. I hate no one, I think everyone has a good side as long as they don't screw me over. Once someone screws me over than I don't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone. Well I guess that's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away. Very bad excuse, I know. My dad thinks it's peer pressure. Peer pressure has never gotten to me I odn't think. I have a strong will about serious things. If I think it's bad and will do something to me I don't like than I won't do it. I tried weed too because I wanted to know the feeling and after researching that it won't cause damage liek other drugs. I tried smokngi cigars and cigarettes jsut to try it and I have astma so I decdie that wasn't for me. I never did really like the idea aobut smokngi. So so I decdied to stick to drinking because after a couple of times I liked the feeling. It was something different to get awya kind of form reality and really let yourslef go but at the same time still know what your doing. My mind goes from one thing to another right now jsut cause of my dad. My mom doesn't know anything which she would probably cry if she found out and that would make me the guiltiest person ever. I would hate that. My dad I don't know. As I sit here thikngi aobut him I feel more and mroe sorry. He came yesterday and gave me a lecture and I said I wouldn't dirnk anymroe but in a way that didn't sound half-true because I couldn't be sincere I thought it was bullshit. A few drinks every now and then can't hurt. Well I know it can but still it's weird I don't know how to explain. Well he came today again and tried to have anothe rone on one. Me and my dad rarely talk I talk to my mom aobut my problems, so I got angry this afternoon and totally went off when he asked me if I was still going to dirnk and if I had done any other drugs. He doesn't trust me me anymore. That hurts the worst. I'm not a eprson to show my feelings ever because I l;iek to think things thorugh. Right now I feel very guilty. I totally blew my dad off this afternoon and I saw the hurt in his eyes and my dad is rarely a person to show his feelings. I guess I get it from him. It's weird. So now I'mthinkngi aobut how I can make it up. I got a e-mail from one of my ex-best friend that's a gurl. We tried gonig out but it didn't work and then firendship fell thorugh too. But somehow we're still really close even thoguh we don't talk to each other anymore. My dad was discussing me with his best friends who is the girl's father. She said I sohuld stop drinknig and that my dad was really hurt. For some reason I still lsiten ot her so I'm reallyt thikngi abut callnig my dad and saying sorry and sincerely saying that I'm going to stop drinknig. I really do want to stop now. I know I can stop if I put my mind to it. I don't need alcohol anymore. One night can ruin the next 6 years haha. It's crazy ",1
"I hope that this isn't a big deal, as I have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner. If I get graded on content or grammar, I'm simply done now. I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like Georgetown or Columbia. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of Connecticut. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in Vegas come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at UT will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like Texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb Mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, Mark is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of Mendelson at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. I think I'm meeting decent people though and I only expect to meet more and more cool people. At first I was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because I was missing the guys I've had a good time with for years. Time to move on. plus I always said I needed to get out of little lame Brookfield. Zebrahead is the bomb. I don't think I ever get tired of their music. I'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. And IF I do see them again, I'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. Being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. But hey, its the price you pay I suppose. Radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. Its horrible I know, but its really not cool what she was doing. Plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. HAHA Like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. Speaking of which, I need to meet some more girls here. Emily has completely drained me over the past two years and I'm glad that I can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. I do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. Its too bad I don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. I don't see what Tyler and Jeremy and Luke see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. You got to love UT, there are attractive girls everywhere. AHAHAH To whoever is reading this, I apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. I've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how I think people are ugly, and how I don't think people are too cool, and how Texas lacrosse isn't very good. I probably sound like one arrogant loser. I'm really not. but I do admit that I am very confident in myself, and I think that rubs off on how I express myself. Actually, I'm probably just pretty arrogant. 311 is the best. Again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. I wish I went to see them in concert here last week, but I've seen them before and I had class early the next day. Live music is the best. I think seeing STP and Cake here the first night I visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. There's a whole lot to do here, I love it. Last night at Sixth Street was pretty fun too even. Everything just seems cool here. I'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. Maybe I should I have left it off when I started writing. yep drawing a blank again. Wonder if Cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and I bet I'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. Okay, my 20 minutes are up, and I could continue if I wanted to, but I'm pretty tired so I think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play Counter Strike. ",1
"I don't know where to start. My mind is full right now with all sorts of thoughts and feelings. UT is great but I am not sure where I fit into things right now. It is really just one big cycle for the time being. When I was driving here from Arlington, my dad told me that I would not hang out with any of the people I already knew because you will ""drift apart. ""  But I like my friends. I have two friends that are going to join a fraternity. I also have two friends who are not going to join a fraternity. The three of us have been going to some of the parties, trying to see if that is the route we want to go. For me, this has been a huge thing on my mind. Constantly. I want to fit in somewhere, but I am not sure I want to pay for it. It really is strange. All this thinking about social life leaves less time for study. Speaking of study, I have nothing to do but read. No busy work. Just reading. That kind of reading will fry your brain. This has been a weird week. Everything has changed. School, friends, family (or lack of). It is kind of cool, though. I am just kind of hoping that a routine starts here. It is really hard to keep learning a new schedule day in and day out. I simply want it to be easy. I guess that is what college is for. It teaches you to grow up. Now I have laundry to do. Just another fun thing to do. It really sounds negative, but my life is good, I guess. Just finished that 32 page questionnaire. While most of it was simple, it really does make you think. Especially when it asks, ""Are you certain about your answers?""  Who knows?  Do you like yourself? Of course. Are you sure?  Yep. I guess it would really suck though if you were thinking about killing yourself all the time. That never crosses my mind. It is too much fun to live. Challenging experiences though. Sure wish UT would have won yesterday. It was great yesterday. Went to a party, then to the game, then we lost. That just kind of ruins the whole effect. Back to the frat thing. We were supposed to go to party for the Sigma Chi's after the game. I really wonder if they try to be your best friend so you will join. Most of the guys are cool. But I think I am going to wait. They all say it is best to join 1st semester, but that is what ""they"" say. I believe my decision to wait should be respected, and if it isn't, then they aren't that cool anyway. I guess. I think I just need to meet more girls. That would make life much more enjoyable. That has got to be the answer. I have moved twice in my life and have always managed to meet people quickly. But at that point, I never knew the difference. Now it is hard. I think it is because of insecurity. I am really not afraid to admit it. I am insecure in meeting girls, but I will have to grow out of it. For now, I just wish I didnt have to read so much. It isn't that bad, just boring. You cannot retain 40 pages of economics in one day. It is just not possible. But I guess I will try my best. ",1
"I really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    I am listening to a Dave Matthew's CD. I was never really a big fan of his until recently. My roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves Dave Matthews. She asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. I had heard a few of his songs, and even though I wasn't crazy about them, I agreed to go. It was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to Houston to go to graduate school. Dave M. was going to be in Houston on Friday and Austin on Saturday. So Robyn ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help Justin move and see the concert in Houston. On our way to Houston the U-Haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. Robyn was devastaed. So Saturday we headed back to Austin and bought tickets to go. After several beers we were there. Somehow I got seperated from my friends. When we found each other I cried, I think it was from the alchol. Anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. I pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. At the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to Dave. I was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. We talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing I had on me). He left but came uback up to me five min later. I was talking to somebody and I saw soomeone come up besaide me. Then I felt a hand on my breast (the right one). It was Dave, signing my chest. I thought I would faint. His voice is so sexy. Later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. I love him and will marry him one day.    Sorry I wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. I guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. I just thought of something else. I have a crush on a waiter that I work with. I'm a hostess. I haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. I'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until Friday. I don't even know anything about him. That's probably why I like him. The last guy I dated was gay. He won't admit it but I know he is. We're not seeing each other anymore. I usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. I just set up my email account today. I'm soo excited. My parents have been bugging me to get one. I'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by Friday.  I really hope no one reads this horrible shit. I know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. I have to go read 19 chapters for English now. Aren't you jealous??!!  ",1
"I'm curious to know whether or not there is or isn't a timer in this program and if it were possible to just quit typing and claim that 20 minutes have passed. My thoughts and emotions concern my future and what I'm going to do. Do I really want to be a psychology major or am I just saying that because it sounds cool. I want to counsel, but id really like to make a ton of money. Maybe everyone is right, I should be a business major, that's what everyone else is doing. But I don't want to deal with  that crap for the rest of my life. I think its boring and stupid. The future is such a difficult concept to ponder. Sometimes I have different goals for it. should I try to satisfy myself, friends or family?  I mean it when I tell my friends that I want to be a professional wrestler, it looks so stinking fun. Just jumping around and bad acting. Well, an acting career would be nice too, but I'm to shy and insecure for that. I think I could do it, but I wouldn't want to associate myself with the thespian weirdoes. I don't think id be able to be my best if I had a problem fitting in with  weirdoes. Maybe I'm the weirdo. nah. probably not. I may be stereotyping them, but, hey, they're weird man. I've seen the way they act. They put the stereotype on themselves. I'm sure there's a couple nice ones though. I wonder if all the famous actors were at one time like that. My mind just drifted to Tricia. She sent me a message saying that she had a couple of dates this past weekend. I wonder how true that is. Of course its true, but its weird how she never dated in high school and then all of a sudden at A&M she's a hot item. I still think about that monster crush I had on her my sophomore yr. I wonder if she liked me too. Everyone thought she did. But I never had the balls to find out for myself. I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life. I'm such a fucking pussy. The same thing last yr. If I had the balls, I think I could have got something started with  Erica at Baylor. Instead, now, we're just good friends. I could have used some support too. But that fucking Ray would have been too jealous if Erica and I got something started. That prick, I think he could've hooked me up with  Courtney too. But he needed her, if not, who would he use to cheat on his girlfriend???  Then her roommate, Darla, man, she's such a little bitch. The thing is, she's not even pretty man. Its okay to be snobby and bitchy if your hot, but she was an ugly little girl, with  nothing to show for herself. Amazing how she was dating all the time. Then her fucking attitude about how she has the perfect mate in mind, but wants to date, because its part of the  college experience. Ray thought like that too. That's such a fucking crock man. As Christians they shouldn't be thinking like that. if this almighty god already picked out the perfect mate for them, there is no reason for them to date around to have fun. They love justifying things. There is something wrong with  what your doing fi you have to justify it man. And then ray went to that Mexico trip to witness to a bunch of poverty stricken Mexicans. Its funny how he couldn't convert me to Christianity in 9 months, but he thinks he can do a whole Mexican community within a couple of weeks. I guess its easier when you feed them and shit. talk about taking advantage of people. Why don't these gung-ho Christians go witness to the people who really ""need Jesus""  They should make mission trips to Washington D. C. and talk to the politicians. they're the fucking sinners man. and the business people too. they're the ones fucking this world up. working for Satan. They don't want to witness to them because they're smarter than them, and they can't find a way to take advantage of them. Christianity is fucked up sometimes. Sometimes I feel like a hypocrite for going to CBS, but if I didn't I wouldn't know anyone. They're nice and I enjoy being there. But most people there have less of a commitment to god than I do, so oh well. I'm glad I'm at UT though. its way better than Baylor, god, I used to get so depressed there. but I'm proud of myself, I toughed out that bullshit. I miss a lot of the guys though. It was a different sort of friendship, but it was cool. I still wonder if I would've stayed if my 1st semester was like the 2nd. but then again I was about to go crazy towards the end. Jesse and Miguel. and big John almost killed me!!  I hope I date here. I think that's all I need to be happy. a good woman. I'd like to have what lijay has, or anything really. I think I'm the only one in our click rite now without someone to ""talk to"". times up. . ",1
"For the past couple of weeks, I have been wondering about one question: Why am I here? As I go from class to class I look around at all the other students just like me standing around like they are waiting for something. What are they waiting for? Should I be waiting for something? A lot of changes have happened to me in the past 3 weeks. As these changes take place, I wonder, ""I guess this is what everyone is supposed to do. Everyone gets caught up in doing what is expected from everyone else. If I were to ask someone as I walk by, ""Why are you here at UT?"" an overwhelming majority would probably reply by saying, ""I don't know"" or ""That's a good question. "" So with that said, I ask myself, ""Why am I here?"" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? Michael Dell is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 97 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being ""brainwashed"" in college. So what exactly does ""brainwashed"" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, ""When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. "" NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn. I don't want to have to ""use"" my degree when I ""get a job. "" I want to hire other people to use their degree. On second thought, I'm glad professors tell college students to find a job with a big company when they graduate. That big company is going to be me. ",1
"Well, I suppose one of the first things that enter into my mind are why in the world did I wait this long to get assignments like this done. I always put a lot of unneccesary pressure on myself by putting these things off. I haven't been doing in college so far, but I know if I was more productive with my time I'd be better off. That and money. I haven't been very good with money lately. Oh, I have plenty to live on, but I spend a LOT of money on things I simply don't need. I also tend to spend money unwisely, like buying things somewhere when I KNOW I can get them somewhere else much cheaper, but I buy it anyways because it's there and convenient. I don't have any income right now eithher, I need a work-study job, but that shouldn't be too hard. I've already paid my rent for the semester, and so a job should cover my phone bill and other little living expenses just fine. I've got some more money coming in for doing webpages for other people, too. The unfortunate thing is, it's getting to a point where it's almost a home-run business, and I'm beginning to worry about whethter or not taxes become an issue. I hate filling out forms, much less loads of tax forms. I'm only 18, and it's a thing I do on the side to make extra money, and I don't know if I should be concerned with such a thing as business tax forms and accounting. I've only done three small commerical webpages . . I don't know if that excuses me from anything. I need to talk to some expert about that. Money is no object to me, in the end, though. That's probably why I'm so careless about most of it. I have been keeping a pretty tight track of it, though, just to make sure I don't go broke. I'm looking at buying a computer, and I think I have just enough. My work study job then could easily cover my little living expenses. I also spend a good bit on music, which is something I'm really into. Not music in general, mind you, but just the stuff I listen too. A lot of it is fairly obscure . . I'm not even talking about rock obscure or grunge obscure or world music obscure. I listen to a good bit of forgotten artist's stuff, like albums they release after they've had their heydey - which is usually in the 80s. I listen to music basically all the time. My roommate has actually been pretty cool about me playing the music all the time, sometimes I wonder if he minds, but I don't think he does. We have a guitar in our room, and it's my roommate's. He doesn't play it too often, only a bit now and then. He's decent. I don't know anything, though. I'm not muscially inclined, personally, in any way. I don't sing or play any insturments, though I wish I did. Something like keyboards or drums would be cool, but I've been learning to apprecaite the guitar more. I like to hear guitarists who make them sing and make distinct sounds than the heavy clunky stuff most grunge-rock-alternative bands make. Steve Hackett, when he was a guitarist for Genesis way back when, is a great example. I heard somewhere that he would try to make the guitar sound more synthesized, and as a result, he played some interesting solos. He made the band sound a little more Floyd-ish I guess. Still, that's the kind of guitar I'd like to learn to play. Acoustic riffs would be neat to learn, too. The keyboards would be tough, but I'd think the most fun to play could be the drums. Drummers have a lot of different styles, I've noticed. I wouldn't leanr to play really fast and make a lot of noise, I would want to learn how to play perfectly timed melodic noises - stuff that doesn't take just speed, but lots of skill, too. I don't know how most bands play it now a days, but drums don't always particularly stand out in some songs now a days, but I guess a lot of them don't hold that as important. When Phil Collins was drummer for Genesis, the drums had moments in the songs when they really stood out. Not because they were loud, neccessarily, but because they were different with what you usually heard. They didn't go along with the song, they would almost LEAD the song. Really, though, all of the members of the band Genesis make it such a great band, which if you haven't caught on by now, is my favorite band. I'm getting a little tired and I have lot more reading and some homework to do. Tomorrow is Monday and classes start up again. Fun. ",1
"I am so cold right now, and I want to take a really long nap. I have so many things to do and I don't know where to start. I miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. I don't know if I like the whole idea of growing up. Sometimes I wish I could be a kid forever. My roommate can sometimes become annoying and I just want to scream. My suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. I really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. The cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. I had the best ice cream the other day at Coldstone Creamery. It was cake batter flavor. Crazy ,huh?  I am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. I am now happy to be in the school of education. So many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. But I am glad that I have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what I truly would love to be. I think I need to take a shower. I want to have a family when I am older and I can't wait to get married and have kids. Someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. Our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. I've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and I hope to build some very good friendships here in college. I tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. I play with my hair a lot and as a result I need to get my hair trimmed. People think it is ridiculous but I have done it since I was a child. I had a conflict with my sister this weekend. I hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. She is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. I think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement"" in college which she did not take advantage off. It's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. I hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on Friday. I really need one and hate relying on someone else's. I wish I was able to pay for it but right now I am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. My mom is the greatest mom there ever was. She would do anything for me. anything. I wish that her and my dad were closer though. When I was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. I really hope that I can plan a trip to go on for Spring Break with my boyfriend. I have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. I wonder if my friend martin from Germany is going to email me back. I haven't heard from him in awhile but I think sometimes he behaves in ways that I would not tolerate. I wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. I guess I need to buy a new blade. My little sister is painting her wall with a mural of New York city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but I don't know about that. My mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but I think she should be a little more realistic. I really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where I can actually move around. I really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. I am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes I worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. I really could see us getting married but I guess I should leave that to God, if you know what I mean. I love pizza an ice cream. I wish they weren't so fattening. I need to go kickbox this week. It's not the same here as it is at 24 hour fitness. It's cool though. good exercise. I'm really tired of typing. I got to go tan outside today. ",1
"I'm thinking this is a different assignment and that it is going to be hard to just let thoughts come in naturally, since I am used to having a specific reason for writing. I always shake my leg. Yes, I do it all the time, like it is a nervous reaction. I think I am tense to often, always worrying about what I need to be doing or what I should be doing. I am trying to relax right now so that I am not tense. Stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes, Health Promotions, (eeh. my leg is shaking again!) Nutrition and Psychology. These classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter. I don't know why I kept avoiding this assignment. I have been putting it off. I think I feel incompetent when it comes to writing. It's not something I would consider myself skilled at. Yes, writing intimidates me. I shouldn't think that I am so inferior. I bet ya'll don't even read these. hmm I wonder if you will read that sentence. Maybe, maybe not. Should I be using proper grammar and punctuation because I really like to go like this yeah I do it all the time when I am conversing over the Internet. The Internet. I'm suspicious of the Internet. It can't be all that good. I spend way too much time online. Just another distraction in this world that leads people away from the important things in life. I cannot possibly write all that I am thinking about, because random thoughts float in and out of my head and I can't type them all. And I forget them by the time I finished what I was typing. Ok. six minutes. I'm suppose to be natural. I don't think I am. I wonder if I should stay on subjects longer, because I really want to. I don't like all this jumping around. I think the main thing is that it has to be continuous. Well, that is easy. I'm always thinking. I think too much sometimes, if that's possible. You know what's been on my mind? I just got back from this scholarship dinner. I have no idea how I got that scholarship. I think they mixed up my name with someone else. I just seemed way under qualified compared to all the other recipients. WOW! There are some amazing people here. Some incredible smart and talented people, and I need to stop feeling inferior to them, because I have my good points also, and I am a very happy person. I'm content with my life. I wonder how many people really are struggling here. Everyone seems like they are just fine and dandy, but you know some people are really sad. People can hide their emotions easily. I doubt thought that a third of the people in my psychology class are depressed. If that is true, than that is very sad. I will admit it; I am cynical of depression. Yeah, sure everything is biological and you can trace it back to that and call it a disease, but really, your mind. that's where you control it. I keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous impact. Do we not have control over our mind? That should be the one thing we do have control over, and that is where the power is. Is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind? I think not. I guess that I'm not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good. close enough to perfect for me. I am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with. I had a good child hood, good parents. No worries really. But, it is not like I've never been depressed. I spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed, but now I look back and understand why I felt that way and how silly it was, and I don't plan on doing that again. I guess, you just have to live and learn. I mean it's ok to do what's wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it's wrong and fix it. Ok. what was that all about? I ramble so much. It's hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it's in 10 places at once. I'm tired. I really am. I always feel a little tired. I had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school. It was horrible, and ever since then I get tired easily. Maybe it's all in my head and I can convince myself that I'm not tired. I should try this. It could be very beneficial. I am already starting to procrastinate. Why? Why is procrastination and epidemic among youth? Hey, I think time is up. I could go on for hours, but I really should get to my other homework. or not. ",1
"As I begin this assignment, I'm not sure what to say. I really never write my thoughts down. Maybe I should. I want to play halflife, but I can't. It seems I don't have enough hours in the day to do everything I want to. Maybe I should be better in my time management. But I think I'm pretty good as it is. I always try to plan out my day, making sure I have enough time for everything. Shoot, I can't believe I misplaced my bracelet, Laine gave it to me. She's so sweet. There's a speck of dust on my calendar. I better pick it up and throw it away. I've made a pact with myself to learn how to type correctly on a keyboard. No cheating whatsoever. It is really weird. But I think I'll grasp it eventually. I was just thinking about my trumpet. I', not in any band here, but I still like playing my horn. I just wish I had the time for it. That really pisses me off. Hopefully, after I firmly get adjusted, I can figure something out. I was just thinking about Saurin, when I went to his place a couple of nights ago. He's such a funny son of a bitch. I had a good time. I wish his place had better lighting, though. its too dark. But I like the living room action. This dorm is very restrictive; I can't wait until I get an apartment. I'm sick of walking to a dining hall for food. And I really want to eat meals with meat in them. I got to finish my math work. Maybe I'll invite Matt over again, Darren's coming over after 6:30. I just have a couple of problems to work out, but then there is the new section. I probably should do most of that tonight so I can ask the TA some questions. That one guy got number 30. But he'll be there tomorrow, so that's cool. Man what's that other guy's name  yellow hat boy  Starts with a G, Garge or something. I checked my answers with him this morning. Most of them were right, thank God. I just hope I can pull something good in this class. I'm determined to work hard. God willing, I won't end up like some of my friends. Man I'm tired. I always seem tired. I don't know why. Four more minutes. this backspace key next to the spacebar is so convenient. I don't have to pick my hand up whenever I make a mistake. That just goes to show how lazy I am. Mofo action lazy. I got a reply from Russell today, I was so glad, I miss him, I miss a lot of people. I guess it's going to take me a while to find people like those I left behind in high school. They were so good in so many ways. There's music playing. oh well, time's up. ",1
"I wonder if my parents are coming to visit me this weekend because I need a lot of things. In fact I need a lot of things. I hope this creating stuff really works. O yeah, that math 408c class seems really intimidating. I wonder if I can really get through because I was struggling through the review session today. Well, at least  tomorrow is friday. thank god. I need a major break. it is funny because I really and honestly want to achieve so much yet I feel so far behind from where I think I need to be. I'm just falling falling far behind. I must get back into shape and into the jist of things. I seriously need a massage. My legs are killing me. I must have walked ten thousand miles today. only 4 months left to go. great. that pennebaker professor seemed pretty cool. I don't think I want to drop that class because it is so hard to get into but it also seems like it will be interesting. I have never taken a psychology course. ba101 can wait. I wonder how all my friends are doing back home. do they miss me?  probably not. I have been here for a week almost. I have met some new people but not as many as I should have. too bad. well, we still have a long time. I think I should join some clubs but I don't know where. hmmmm. this song sucks. I can't wait until friday. I miss everyone I knew. it sounds strange but I really miss them. I need to work out some more. I feel so tired. but I am really surprised I am not  homesick. though I do miss the food. I can live like this. it seems pretty fun even though I don't have a car. I think my dad and my brother went bowling. I feel so sleepy. I miss playing the piano and the guitar. I came here to escape a lot of things but it seems that the distance has brought me closer to what I wanted to get away from. lucky for me there are a lot of distractions because sometimes I find myself thinking about somebody more than I should. I don't deserve this. why does this sound so depressing?  let's t hink happy thoughts. that girl van that I met today seemed pretty cool. really very outgoing and even waited for me after class. that's pretty cool. I am glad I have dan as a roommate. his sense of humor is always there. I feel like playing basketball but I need to catch up with schoolwork already. the sad things is that it is the second day only. I can't believe I have the same 2 classes with tyson, some guy I met at camp. what are the chances of that?  and Lira my second cousin was in my economics class. so is angela johnson from my old high school. but the professor. well  nevermind. so many memories. time to make some new ones. should I call my parents tonight. yea I t hink I will. dang I still have to do that calculus homework. I hope it is not that long. I need to do a lot of reading too. for mis 310 so I can get caught up. well the good thing is that my day is over at lunch time. yay!!!  but dan is going back to houston and leaving me all alone. so many th ings to do so little time. but I love the ut experience. I really do. hookem horns. ",1
"I am thinking about an email I just read. It's from a friend from a      kickboxing class. He was giving me a hard time, Which is fine because I make fun of him too. He's a pretty funny guy but I am really trying to come up with a good joke to really bust his chops. I am also thinking about  how depressed everyone is today, being September 11th and all. I wonder how Sept. 11th will be in like 50 years. I also wonder how long it will take for it to get into student's text books. I hope they don't do the same thing that they did for Pearl Harbor and Titanic, and make a love story out of it. That's rediculous, there is more to it than some guy going off to work while his wife is at home and his lover is at his secret apartment. I bet a lot of people will be angry if someone manages to come up with one. I would hate to be President Bush now. He has some tough decisions to make. Half of the country says: Kill 'em all! While the others are screaming:   PEACE.   No matter what, someone will not get what they want. Even in the West Mall today, there are tons of people speaking their opinion, showing signs and passing out ribbons. But it's not totally black and white. I think there is a grey area. Some people say war and some say peace, but I think we can find some in-between. Killing innocent children isn't a good idea but we have to stand up for ourselves if we want this to stop. I don't know. . I don't like talking about politics or religion. Too much controversy. Everyone is too stubborn to see the sides of others. I am also thinking about when I was here in the computer lab yesterday. Some girl started crying really loud in the hallway. It was just like out of the movies. None of us knew what was going on. Some people got up and went to see, which (although curious myself) I thought was rude. I went to my kickboxing class last night. It really makes me feel self-confident. Learning those moves last night was a lot of fun. Why isn't the time and minutes thing doing anything? I am afraid that I will have to do this all over again. I am looking around the room and noticing that just about everyone here is checking their email. I guess no one does work on computers!!!  I like coming in here to check my email but I always feel like someone is reading what I am typing behind me. If they want to know so bad, they should just ask. I am very tired. I went to bed late, and slept through my alarm. But somehow I still made it to my 9:00 class. Barely! That class is fun. Learning sign language is very important I think. Just as important as learning Spanish or French or something. Going to the social events will be sort of weird though. Since I am not very good at signing, I will pretty much be a wall flower.    ",1
"what to write?  I am happy right now because I just got a phone call from a  frat that I am going to join. we are having a get together tomorrow and there are going to be strippers!  that should be cool. but I don't know what to wear. I always get nervous about what I should wear. I hope my girlfriend does not find out, even though I will probably tell her, and she'll probably get mad like she sometimes does. I wonder when clay is coming home?  we have to work out tonight, and I still have a lot of Persian how to do. my throat feels better today than it has all weekend. I was really sick for the last three days so I stayed home and watched the 30th anniv. of Planet of the Apes. that was a good movie. I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of UT. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got. I need to call laila, I miss her. maybe we could all play solarquest. my neck is stiff but I still have 10 minute to write. this takes forever. I wonder when it is due?  I heard the 11th but I am not so sure. I wonder what the other assignment is about. I hope it is not like this. ,  I have a lot to do tonight but I must be in bed by 12. I need all the sleep I can get. I am tired. this is really starting to bore me. what is the point? write down every thought you think. seems creepy. I hope who ever reads this one is laughing and enjoying themselves. some how I doubt it. this is not very funny--it would be though, if I could say it. I hope no one minds all the hundreds of mistakes I made, and if they do, who cares?  what are they going to do?  put in computer jail?  Someone I knew said that all the time. but I can not remember who. I miss Joann. I wonder how she is doing at Sam Houston state. I also miss jena, I really hope I see her before she goes and flies off to Germany. I hope her life is not hard, and I wish here and michael all the best. my ear hurts. four minutes left. I was beginning to feel trapped in time. stuck forever by this computer typing away through all eternity. I am really tired, but I am glad I got this one out of the way. just a couple of minutes left. that woman at the dinner was so weird. and what about her HUGE 2 year old?  that was scary, but so is ""Walt"" so I guess it is okay. Well time has run out and now it is time to go. that took forever. ",1
"I am thinking about calculus. I wish I could be working on Calculus instead of doing this assignment. I wonder if I am doing this assignment correctly. Do we need to write about what exactly we are thinking, or in question/sentence format. Well I made a decision at the very beginning to write it in sentence format because that is how I have been taught to write at school for so long. I am hungry. I should have made prepared something in the oven, so when I am done with this assignment I would be able to eat it. Now I have started so I must suffer the consequences and be hungry for twenty, or approximately 17 more minutes. I am thinking about what the purpose of this assigment is. I guess it is so you will think about what you are thinking. I want to type things in here as if I was talking to someone, but then again I quickly remember that I am supposed to be writing my stream of consciousness. How fast should I be typing. Should I think about it, then type it, or think about it as I am typing it, or is it a combination of both. Today, I have thought so much about thinking. A new concept entered my mind last night and it is pretty incredible. I can actually get a better grip on my thoughts and thus I am better able to control what I am thinking. This is good because the more control of yourself you have, the more control of every situation you are put in you can then have also. I think that sentence did not make much sense but I know that I know what I am talking about. I am still really hungry. I wonder how many minutes I have to go. Oh, its at the top of the screen, so far I have completed 8 minutes. What else is there to talk about?  I don'e exactly know what Im thinking about right now. wait. ok. . I think I am thinking too hard. Well what would you like me to write about. what I think about really depends on what I am trying to think about. and thinking about thinking seems like it leaves my mind blank. But then again, it is not blank at all. I feel like today was a great day. Everyday that I am alive is a great day. I also think that I worry too much, but when I worry less I have time to think about the things that really matter. But what really matters?  I am soooooooooo hungry. I only have 9 more minutes to go. This writing assignment has to be one of the easiest, requires alot less effort , than most writing assignments. But this assignment is different from all the rest in the fact that I am actually starting to see how this (thinking/ stream of consciousness) works. Once I master it, I feel like I will have accomplished one of the hardest challenges in the world. to find one's self. Ok. . now my stomach is growling. I will be so happy when today is over and I get to lay my head to rest. I am going to appreciate sleeping alot more now that I think about it. It really not only gives your body a break but it also gives your mind a break. Today I feel like my mind has been in overdrive. I have had at least three people tell me I am deep, and I met alot more people today. User's guide. this book sitting right in front of me. I guess I took a break in thinking, and that is what I saw. I am so tired. physically, mentally. I have not pushed myself as much as I did today, and somehow I know it will be for the better. I am so glad that my parent's pushed me to go to college. I think it is an absolutely great/priceless experience that everyone owe's to themselves. Knowledge is power, knowledge about one's self and knowledge about the world are two great tools when your digging through that thing called life. I love that college has brought to my attention some ideas that would have never crossed my mind prior. Well I just looked at the time again and I have approximately 30 more seconds. I ho ",1
"dreams are like the screen that shows these things to me, like last night's dream--  probably shows true feelings, but more specifically, true fears. fears about who the people I know really are, and especially the way that I feel about those people deep inside. I don't like to analyze them too deeply because who knows, I might find something too true or too scary to be true. then there are fears about who I am. sometimes I admit that I am afraid of relationships and of being hurt, but sometimes I admit that that is just an excuse for being afraid of something else. sometimes my dreams will reveal things I didn't think I could feel-- sometimes there is some energy in my dreams that I can feel for days. a lot of times I say that I am by nature an independent person, I work better alone. there are some people in this world that fall apart without someone to hold their hands, but I'm not one of them. I do need my family and close friends-- I couldn't even think about living without them. but how would I be with one person who is always supposed to be there, to be mine and me to be his. my romantic side loves that and believes in that; my independent side can't handle that. but I have often heard myself say that those people that are the dependent type still need to be alone sometimes. depending on someone your entire life just leaves you helpless when you are left alone. it shoes your weakness and vulnerability. but then again I guess for some ""lucky"" people they will never be left alone. I think that it is healthier to be alone first, to establish who I am before someone else can drill in me their thoughts and beliefs. I need to be my own person before I can become somebody else's, be strongly sewn in the ground so that he can't pick me out. depending on someone, or having someone depend on you takes a part of you away. it should be two people, as separate wholes, coming together, not one part making the whole. it is good to be open-minded, and I try to be, just not easily influenced. I try to be aware of the differences in each other and accept people for those differences but at the same time not let my true self be sucked in by anything untrue. my perception of strength is just that:  though available for those who look to you, staying solid in yourself.

"For instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd of students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. In addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because I live off campus. I attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems I haven't established any new friendships yet. However,  I will continue my efforts throughout the semester. Furthermore, I have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework I have been assigned each evening. It is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. I have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles I encounter. I have dreamed of earning my degree at the University of Texas since I was a small child. As I grew into a young adult, I never let go of my aspiration to attend the University. My unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. I will accomplish my goals and I will prove to myself and family I can do anything that I put my mind to. When I get discouraged, I refer to the scripture, ""I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. ""  I know I can succeed at the University of Texas with my sincere desire and strong determination. ",1
"     I am sitting hear at my desk in the dorm listening to Ashley in the kitchen. I   hear the cabinets shutting and bowls that are clanging together. I wonder what   she is eating for lunch It kind of makes me hungry too. Now I'm thinking about   when I'm going to eat . I have my discussion class in another 40  minutes across   the street. I'm worried that I won't make it to the psych SI meeting afterwards   because there are so many things to do. I told Katy and Jenina that I would go with   them, but I really want to go by the party on the plaza to see all the clubs and   organizations. I'm not sure why I want to go by there. There are so many different   organizations that I want to do and I am feeling so stressed out right now with all   the options racing through my head, but i don't want to overcommit because then   what if I can't handle the coursework and my grades drop. That also worries me. I   have three tests coming up next week at least in my huge intro classes. I am so   confused as to what they will be over and how closely I should be reading and   what I need to pick up on. That is why I really need to go to the SI meeting today.  Hopefully that will help. So now I am thinking back to what organizations I want to   join. I am already feeling so overwhelmed with having to squeeze in 10 study   hours a week for Kappa Delta. I don't think that much time is unreasonable, but it's   just that I have to walk to the house and that takes time and then I might run out of   reading to do and just end up sitting there. If it weren't for the rowing team, I would   be able to spend plenty of time there, but it just so happens that I row in the   afternoon, so I can't really get anything done for a solid length of time. That   sidekicks meeting was fun last night, but I really don't think I can go to the party   tonight because I need to sleep. I always falll asleep in that RTF class at 8 am and   I need to be alert. Oh, and I have that spanish composition that I need to learn   vocab and the verb forms for. There is so much to do and I'm worried that I just   can't do rowing because  it takes so much time, but maybe I'd rather be playing a   sport then watching it liek the sidekicks organiztion. I just don't know. I also want to   play volleyball, but I can't decide what level to play on. My FIG is starting a team,   but will that be frustrating because we won't be good and I want to play   competetively or will it be relaxing and fun. I can't decide!  I really want someone to   tell me what will work best because I just want to enjoy college. Ashley just flushed   the toilet so that water is running. I wonder what is wrong with her. She's been so   upset the last few days and it's weird that she doesn't stay here some nights. I think   it's boyfriend problems, but she won't say. And I think it's weird that Tim was over   here when I walked in last night. If I were Diana I think that would weird me out, but   I guess I shouldn't worry about that. He seems nice though.  I miss everyone so   much. I love Anna and my KD girls, but life just isn't the same. I don't want to be   home, but I want all my friends to be here with me. No one understands me liike   they do and I miss all the closeness that we had together. I especially wish jennifer   and Becky were here. I need to be harassed by Becky in her caring funny way   and I need Jen's crazy overexcited   guess what   every now and then. I hope   Ashley is doing well. She's probably in London right now. The T. V. is on in the   next room and I hear a motorcycle outside. I hate those things so much. They are   so dangerous. I can't decide what to do tonight. I want to go out and meet guys, but   I really shouldn't. I hope that Paul guy doesn't call this weekend. He's the biggest   player. Oh I wonder if I have OU tickets yet. I can't believe they're only giving out   2,000. I really need to get to class. I feel guilty after all the september 11th stuff   yesterday and not going to the candlelight ceremony, but I just get so depressed   after seeing it over and over and then not being with the same people I was at this   time last year makes me sad. I miss everyone so much, but now I need to go to   class. ",1
"I really miss Desiree. she is my best friend and it hard not being able to talk to her everyday seeing as how I don't have my cell phone here with me. my not so intelligent sister was supposed to send it to me in the mail Saturday, but how much do you want to bet that she didn't send it until Monday and I wont get it until Thursday before I leave to go to Houston. I'm drawing a blank. how am I supposed to write for twenty minutes when I'm struggling to think of something to write after only two. I guess I shouldn't think so hard, should I. is that supposed to be a question mark? anyway. I'm really enjoying this psychology class. I thought that it might have been boring but as luck would have it Pennebaker is actually a really energetic professor. I like that. it almost seems as if he can relate to his students on a deeper level but at the same time he is still able to get his lesson across to us. kind of reminds me of Brink, my science teacher in high school. he has been there for quite some time now and he never ceases to amaze his students with his ability to connect with us. I do not know one person in Cleveland High School or one person who came through CHS and had Brinkley that didn't like him or his approach to teaching. I miss him. I miss high school. college life is really overwhelming at times. Right now I'm pretty much struggling to stay in school and let me tell you that it is not easy. I partied way too hard last semester and it would be a shame for me to go home and have to endure the horrible comments from everyone. Oh nikki couldn't handle that big school. She got the big head and got shot down as soon as she got there. Look at little miss I'm smarter than you back in Cleveland. I guess it was lonely up there on her high horse. I have to be a success and that is why I have buckled down on my studies and reading this semester. it is so important that I become somebody. I can't stress that enough. I refuse to go back home and end up on the same path that the rest of my family has chosen for themselves. its not easy living up to others expectations when you know that you can do it but aren't sure if you know how or if you have the drive to do so. My family is a bunch of nobodies and I hate to say that. Well in an educational sense of the term. None of them went off to school in order to better themselves. but then again I can't really blame them for that. I mean we really don't have the resources required to be true leaders or successes when coming from an educational stance. I'm here on financial aid as it is. its not easy walking in my shoes. some people think I have it so easy but they really have not idea what kind of challenges I had to overcome to get here. it was not an easy road to tow. I been through it all and still have managed to survive only by the grace of God. Speaking of God I miss TJ and Trinity and Tristan. I only wish that I had more time with them before they left. especially TJ. He was and still is my baby. I love him and miss him so much but his psycho parents took him away from me. they could have left but why him. I remember there being a time when he wouldn't even go to them when I first started working in the nursery and how he could only say no. that was my little boy. I love him and miss him like  you would never understand or maybe you would because I'm sure you have kids and even though he wasn't mine I loved him like he was. ",1
"It is really really very very cold in my room. I do not know why they keep it so very cold in the dorm rooms. it is also cold in the dining hall. I am forced to wear my hoodie and always have a blanket on. I am glad I brought two blankets. sitting like this on my chair my foot is falling asleep. the chair is not so comfortable as a whole. josh has one of those big black comfy desk chairs that professional type people have it is the coolest thing ever. too bad he is a jerk eh. owww I just hit my knee on the stupid desk thing. I wish my roommate would come home she was supposed to be here like two hours ago. we are going out tonight which is good because all I have been doing the last couple days is studying which is necessary but it isn't all that fun. I need to borrow duct tape so I can tape up the cords on the desk because they are ugly-looking. we were supposed to go to target sometime also, to buy a rug for the floor because the floor in this room is COLD. some of the classes on this campus are very far away from my dorm room. maybe I should figure out the whole bus system so I can take a bus down to them. although walking is good exercise and I do need exercise. you would think with an exercise room downstairs I would go down there and use it. maybe if my roommate does not come back by the time I am done this I will go work out for awhile. but then I will have to take another shower. don't know if it is worth that. because then I will also have to dry my hair and I hate hair dryers. they are evil things. whoever decided that girls need to dry their hair in order to look good was an evil person. they never should have been invented. same with makeup. we should all just be completely natural. if somebody really, truly, likes you, they will like you all the same with no makeup on. at least that is my philosophy and I am sticking to it because I hate putting makeup on. it's a pain. a waste of time, if  you will. the cd stopped. I should put another one on. now I'm going to have 'yo's a ho' stuck in my head. it's not a bad song just not a song I would like to have stuck in my head. I always wake up in the morning with some random song stuck in my head. it's weird. I don't know where they come from. last night I had a dream that I was yelling at erin. in someone's driveway- until she walked out on the street. I am unsure of what we were yelling about but I don't think it would be that hard to get us to be yelling at each other. it's really weird how easily one of your friends can turn hostile on you. I have an itch on my leg. it's itchy. my hands are cold from typing, and because they are exposed to the cold that is my room. too bad there isn't a thermostat type dealy in this room like some of the other dorm buildings have. I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 1984. I don't like it. I mean, these people are all almost 18 years old. and they are Church of Christ - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms'. I definitely could not live like that. I don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it's a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 550 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates. BRRRR my hands are cold. the cushion thing on the chair keeps sliding around and it is really quiet in here. I need to talk to my suitemates more. they seem nice but we don't ever talk to them it's really a shame. I need to clean the water filter pitcher so I can drink some water. water is good stuff. josh says some girl he knows drinks 3 glasses of coffee a day. I don't drink any caffeine. I did one day and I was jittery and nervous and bouncing off the walls and stuff. it was not enjoyable. my mom drinks coffee everyday. I don't understand why people think they need it. is it psychological? or do they really need it to wake up?  on tv people always say lets go get coffee"" or ""we need some coffee"" and it's always after some traumatic event or really late at night. I think that drinking coffee then would make things worse. what you would need is some sleep, and caffeine would not help sleep. it would keep you awake. at least it keeps me awake. I guess some people can sleep even though they have caffeine in them? I wonder why andy called this morning. I called him back twice and he didn't answer either time. weird. people are weird. all of them. especially james. with his bald head. it does not make any sense to me why he took a year off from the core. he seemed to have loved it and his excuse of ""I am a. d. d. "" doesn't really make all that much sense. because. the core is so disciplined. I would think it would be good for a person who had a. d. d. I wonder if there is a another period if you end a sentence with an abbreviated word. that would look really funny. like 2/3 of a "". ""  well I am going to end this the way I started it. it is really really very very cold in here. ",1

I'm glad I took psychology, never down it before it is actually interesting, getting graded for thinking for horrible that lamp which I am looking at right now is- insane! Why did I buy it?

I never realized there are so many voices in my head till I actually paid attention to them. Thank you!        My subconscious ness mind is telling me in hungry! I think I will go with Mr. Freud and listen to my subconscious mind - ' free association'!        Thank you once again,    Regards,    Arundathi               ",1
"I don't know what to do with my boyfriend. I am so distracted by him and I should be studying and trying to do reaslly well my first semester in College. I don't really feel that great today. I really feel like taking a bath. It would be really cool if our neighbors would urn down the music so our walls would stop shaking. I wonder eho the package is from that I got. It is really stupid that I won't be able to pick it up until Tuesday. My room is pretty lonely and the show on tv is pretty weird. I miss my roommate already. Maybe I should have gone home this weekend. Oh, well I guess my weekend is going ok because I got to see both Jared and Eddie yesterday and that made me happy. I miss Jared right now. I wish  my siter was here. We would have so much fun. I heard that she already took over my room. I don't really know what I think about that. I don't know how I am going to get all my work done, I can't believe I slacked off sp much and I would have had all my stuff done already. Oh well, I guess next time I will do better. I hope that I will be able to get my application to the Texas Spirits this week so I can start meeting people. Maybe I should have joined a sorority so that it might be easier to meet people. Hopefully with the things I am attempting to join I will be able to meet some more peope. It is so hard to meet girls to be friends with. Boys are so easy to meet because they almost always talk to you and try to get to know you. Maybe it is just hard for me to actually meet friends and not just acquaintances. All my frinds from high school were pretty much people that I had been friends with since CAtholic grade school. Making it not very common for me to meet all differnet people form many  difference places. Ut is sp doverse and so absolutely different from anywhere I have been before. Except for New York City, I guess. But I guess it is wierd because it is such a mix of people that are all my age and all here for the same reason and I guess that is prety hard to comprehend. I wonder ho Jennifer is at LSU. The last time I talked to her , she sounded like she was having the time of her life. I hope she doesn't forget all the fun we use to have and doesn't change that much. So far, it seems like Kristen and Colleen have changhed a lot and they have only been gone a toatla of like two weeks. I haven't talked to Sarah at all , I hope she is doing ok. I wonder if she has met WEs yet , I bet they would get along really well. This wirting is completely all over the place. I am not really sure how this shows the way my brain works. Iguess it has been about twenty minutes. so I guess I can end my rambling. ",1
"Well, I'm not really sure what types of things I'm supposed to be saying. I miss my boyfriend so much. I hope he has a safe trip home. I hope he doesn't fall asleep. I feel really sleepy myself. I hope I can stay awake for this twenty minutes. Time seems to go by so slowly when you're sleepy. Especially when school work is involved. I wish I was a better typer. It is so hard to just think normally when you're typing on a computer. People probably think I'm not a very interesting person. I try to be, but I think I was born to be boring. Be boring and study my life away. I really don't mean to be so studious. I mean I want to do well in school, but I think I'm too caught up in it. Everything makes me nervous. It is so strange because even though I know this isn't going to be ""graded"", I feel nervous about doing it wrong or not doing a good job. I miss my family and my friends. I don't think I appreciated them enough when I was home. It is so hard to build a friendship up from scratch. It took years to be so close to them, and now I have to start all over. I'm truly lucky to have people that share all of my memories and understand all of my feelings. I wonder if they miss me as much as I miss them. I'm so paranoid. I'm always concerned that people are deceiving me in relationships. What if they don't mean ""love"" in the same way that I do?  I hate being hurt. I like to be in control and be omniscient. I like to have the upper hand with people. Unfortunately,  I think most of the time I'm the vulnerable one. Is that normal?  Probably. If I tell myself that enough I might believe it. Could someone really love someone enough that they would die for them if they had to. So many songs make that claim. It must be a truly amazing love. I am still in awe when I think about what Jesus did for me and everyone else. He died a most humiliating and painful death so we wouldn't have to. What love!  How sad though to think that not everyone accepts it!  I feel so guilty when talking to someone that doesn't accept it. I feel like there is something I could say to solve it, but I just don't know what. I know I'm not doing everything I could for Christ, and therefore not being quite good enough. I know I can't be perfect, but I try so hard to be. It feels that I come up short a lot in my life. It is so stressful. I'm probably going to die at an early age because of it. I can't stop though. Kale is so wonderful. He would do anything for me. I can't imagine anyone loving me that much unless they have to. My parents have to, but he doesn't. It is amazing. ",1
"     I feel really stressed about school right now. I hate my rhetoric class, because she makes us turn in homework everytime we meet which is three days a week. So I am behind in my reading for a lot of other classes that I am taking. It makes me so frustrated that she doesn't seem to care that I am taking 15 hours of credit and I don't have time to read a 150 page novel in two days. I'm drinking this drink called Capri Sun. Its ok but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'm really thirsty though and I don't really want to drink water. Our water tastes gross too. I don't know what is in it, but everytime we put it in our refridgerator, it gets a bad taste to it. Everytime my roommate talks about the water tasting bad, I think of the movie Signs, and that cute little girl who said her water tastes old. Atleast if aliens come to earth, we'll have water to through on them. My monitor is on the fritz. It keeps turning neon shades of red. . more like purplish pink. Or something of that nature. It really makes my eyes hurt when it does that. I just hit it and it goes back to normal for a few moments. I can't figure out why its doing that except for the fact that it is old. I talked to my old friend Kyle last night. He called me a cutie. Why I don't know. I didn't really know how to react to a comment like that especially from him, because we had a history a long time ago, and things were never really the same. I really liked him too. It kind of unnerved me when he said those things. I just kept saying   how can you say something like that to me  . He is really good with mind games, so he kind of played around with my mind for a moment there. He makes me so mad, but at the same time, I like to hear that kind of stuff from him. It does make me feel pretty. I don't really know what this thing is supposed to help me do. . the whole writing in a stream of conciousness way seems hard to do. I just write what I think, but at the same time I feel like I am thinking what I want to write, just so I can write it, as confusing as that sounds. I miss my friends. They are too far away to see. Some of the people who came to UT with me live on the other side of campus and they don't ever call. I felt like everyone already had friends when we got here and their   old   high school friends didn't matter any more. It really hurt my feelings to realize that. I honestly believed them when they said that they wanted to hang out with me when I got to school. My other friends live far away. they all have new friends too. I feel left out or behind, because I don't have a new good group of friends. I really hope that my mom is doing ok. She always says that she is, and probably just because she doesn't want me to worry. But I do. I don't like being far away from her, because I can't keep up with how she is. Not that she is unhealthy all too much, but sometimes she will hurt her back, or she, like everyother human, gets sick. I pretty much think of her as a superhero. Invinsible to the harm of the world. I want my mom to always be here with me. Now I am older and I know that my mom isn't anything other than a normal human, and it makes me worry. Anything can happen anyday to me, my mom, anyone I know. Its pretty frightening, but in the same sense you have to no think about stuff like that and just live life as it comes and live life for today. I try to do that. Maybe that is why I don't do my homework. I could die tomorrow and what would I have to show for it? An all nighter of reading. I hate reading. It is one of the worst things you could make me do. That and writing papers and having my peers grade me. I always feel like I am going to miss something if I am stuck reading. My mom and my sister are avid readers, but I do not share the same feelings for it. Plus if ever I don't understand a word, or the reading gets boring, I stop paying attention and therefore do not understand a single word I just read. I hate it. I have to read books multiple times to understand them and then I might never get it. I honestly wish that reading and writing were obsolete. Impossible and shallow I know. I mean, where would we be without that stuff? No where, I am assuming. Allthough I know better than to assume! I am not really a person who enjoys school. I love to listen to my teachers tell interesting stories, screen movies and make visuals in class. All of this taking notes and reading bores me. I wish school was like my elementary year and like my LEAP classes where cut and paste was the prefeered way of learning. Those were the days. It really stinks to be all grown up. And to think that a few years ago, that's all I wanted to be. ",1
"Ah! 8secs! O no 16 sec! er. er. what am I supposed to type. this is kinda stupid. ah! phone! must not answer. must not answer! hi Shawn! er. talking to Shawn. typing with one hand. not thinking straight. can't multi-task. Ah! 2min 17 sec! hang up Shawn! hang up! eeek. panicking! Talking about tomorrow's chem Exam. Man, didn't even know until just a few minutes ago when Shawn called to remind me. Hm. I should start studying right after I finish this. I got to get more organized and responsible. I wonder what other peoples thoughts are like, I watched What Women Want not too long ago, that is a very interesting movie. it says a lot about how women think. I wonder if any of it is actually true. wouldn't it be nice to know what women are thinking. I would like that power, I can never really tell what they are thinking. my room mate is watching an anime with cute girl voices and drama. I think it's called Kare Kano or something like that. reminds me of Fruits basket. o well, hm. there never seems to be adiquet lighting around my work area. maybe I should get another light, my room mate is laughing. the anime sounds funny, making all those funny anime noises. I miss something. I don't know what. I should call An-Vi earlier today, I think she was kind of disappointed that I didn't call her the other day. I wonder how college is like for her in UTSA, she says it is nice and all, but I bet there are a lot of good looking guys there. heh, what am I talking. thinking about. shouldn't worry. hm. I wonder. don't know what I'm wondering, Juliet's thoughts were much better I think, mine are just not really relevant. ice cream. why? I don't know. being influenced by others thoughts :p o well. need more water, can't drink water from first few weeks of school. I miss hugging her. I feel lonely. don't know why, there are a lot of pretty girls in UT Austin, a lot of asians. wonder why everyone likes to party so much. mom always says that there will be someone for me, there are tons of pretty girls in UT. guess she was right, but don't know if any of them will like me. :sigh: I would like a better hair style, mine seems too plane, I would like to spike it like Goku but not as short as most guys nowadays. 14 min. I wonder how much I've written, I should learn to type faster. ice cream. food. hm. I've been eating less lately. pretty much only eating lunch. a late lunch at that, The hills are a live with the sound of music!"" heh, don't know why I just thought of that, 15 min. hm. :looking at finish button: I wonder if I'll be able to print this out. I feel like I'm not thinking deep enough, I wonder why. should I go back this week or no? I want to because my parents probably miss me, and I want to tell them to be less stressed so their immune system won't become worse. there is a potluck party this weekend back home apparently. my roommate is going back, I'm not really thinking any of this I think. it's more like a cover of what my mind is really chaotically thinking about. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't sleep well. never could. wish I could. then I could stay awake in class. :blank:. well, Merry x'mass for you is on my songs list. it's sung by Aya Matsuura. wouldn't it be nice to be friends with her, I wonder if I can ever become really important, eh, I think it's more important to know as much as possible and help more people, like superman or something. well, hm. about 55 sec left. I feel like I should type something more meaningful, I've pressed backspace a lot. I wonder how my sister is. I want to go to a party. and meet more people. I wonder how Daniel is, he was mad at me, don't know for sure now. Juliet is cool, she likes some things that I didn't know anyone else would like, interesting how life works out. didn't know my friend in high school's hobbies would make me interested in something that someone else would be interested in. funny how life is. I've coincidently met people I've not really known but just know on the streets of the campus lately. like Grace and LiLa and some other friends. I think I'm getting better at talking. I want to get smarter. I feel small for some reason. dreams are for the lazy. goals are for the ambitious. I like to dream. I'm ambitious. is that bad or good? I have no idea. ",1
"At the moment I I can seem to think about is how strange it is to think about what I'm thinking about. I'm not really sure if I can truley display my thoughts if that's what I'm concentrating on instead of letting my mind wander subconsiously. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but it does to me. I'm trying to fight the temptation to go back and reword/correct sentences. Its very strange. I'm also trying not to have more than a two seconds pause between words/sentences so that I can show a true, 20 minute, unbroken stream of thought. I can't , unfortunately, fight the urge to correct typos - its natural for me to press the delete key the oment I see a mistake pop up on the screen. It will be interesting, however, to read this when I'm finished and see how many mistakes I missed. My roomate just put a CD on that I haven't heard in a long time - it makes mee think about highschool (the last time I listened to this)  what is it called?   . Oasis I think  you, and the name of the song is ""Wonderwall""  I sincerely hope that its just a TA reading this and not Dr. Keller because I'll probably be embarrased at my grammar usage/sentence structure, ect. ect. Did you know (I'm sure you do) that ""etcetara"" is Latin for ""and so forth""  I know this because I took Latin in high school. It was a complete waste of time. I only got little useless trivial pieces of infromation out of it. Thought my favorite insult is still ""habitas familia in miser villa"" (you and your family live in a miserable farmhouse)  Our teacher left midway through our senior year and so they had a spanish teacher named Mr. Soto teach the class. Kind of funny because he didn't know Latin, but hey, actually knowing the language is just optional right?  Latins dead anyway. hehe  It just occured to me that this is actually how I type a , drat, phone. k, that was my girlfriend, Liz. we're not having the best of time, though I'm sure (I hope) we'll work it out. I pondered writing during the phone conversation but that would be weird (especially for Liz) because I seriously doubt I can type and talk at the same time. unless I type giberish. or talk giberish; either of which would be bad in their own right. what was I talking, er. tyiping about before?  I actually had to scan up the page to read and remember - it was email. I was thinking about how I actually type a lot of emails like this - not really without thinkg about what I'm saying and not looking for grammar and all that but just typing continously. Usually because I'm emailing like 5 different people and it takes to long and its annoying. speaking of annoying, this is taking a long time  Its amazing how long 20 minutes can go by when you're thinking what else you could be doing. we're going to play risk in about 25 minutes. I love Risk. I'm not sure really, there's just somethin strangely fun about taking over the world. I also play this game on my computer called ""Civilization, Call to Power"" which is wonderfullly complex and very challenging. You build a civilization from 4000bc to 3000ad and either try to beat the computer opponents economically and in number of scientific andvances (kind of on a point system) or attempt to take over the world. In my currect game I have eliminated 3 of the 4 computer oppents and I'm going for the kill on my last enemy, the Persians. I made the mistake of using nuclear weapons and now my populace is very angry at me because of nuclear fallout and all that garbage. How many people have actually tried to take over the world?  3?  Alexander, Napoleon and Hitler. All failed. I wonder if its even possible. Probably not, especially when your enemies have nukes. Nukes are kind of scary, I try not to think about them. Ok, thats 20 minutes FINALLY! ",1
"You know, being in a relationship is great. And I absolutely LOVE College. But I have discovered that it is REALLY hard to put the two of them together. I mean, Jason and I have been together for about 8 ¸ monthssmall on the grand scale of things, I know, but it seems like an eternity. In fact, I find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before Jason. He is, after all, my first real serious relationship. And I don't know. I mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn HARD to keep what we have in college. I love him. I mean really love him. He says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. I think that if you're in love, then you KNOW. So that means that he probably doesn't love me. We're lopsided. So that kind of sucks, but I deal with it, you know? I mean, sometimes it gets me down because when I say, ""I love you"" I don't hear one back. So, I get depressed. But he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and I guess that's enough to suffice. Maybe sometimes I feel like I just have enough love for the two of us, but other times I become really doubting. Maybe I don't love him either. I mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? How do we know that love even really exists? How do we know? I mean, yeah, there are songs, books, and not to mention millions of people that attest to its veracity. But how do I know that it's not just a really big ""like. ""? I mean, maybe that's all I have for Jasona really big like. That makes me think. Because, if it is just a really big like, then where did all of this ""love"" stuff come from? Do I say that I love him because it's my first real relationship and I just don't really know any better? Am I really just enamored with him because he was my first? Is the fact that I'm questioning it at all mean that it isn't real love? Don't they say that if you have to question love, then it isn't really love? I mean, I know that I would do anything for this boy. And I mean anything. I know that I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to be with him, to see him, to touch him, to smell him, to make him smile, to make him laugh, to hear his voice. I know that when I'm not with him, I am wondering where he is or what he's doing or wondering if he's wondering about me. But, it's like deep down, I know that he's not. He doesn't feel about me the way that I feel about him. And because he says that he likes me a lot, and he's not sure if it's love or not. since I like him more, that makes me think that what I feel must be love because it's on a higher level than that of which he feels. Logical, right? I didn't think so either. I guess I'm just confused. Most guys aren't as confusing as Jason. Actually, for the most part, he's a pretty straightforward kind of guy. But he holds his feelings in and masks themit is really hard to read him. I mean, I'm always wondering ""ok, he says he's fine. but does that mean that he's really ok, or does that mean that he's still upset but doesn't want to tell me?"" I mean I secondguess myself all of the time with him. I have a really low selfesteem when I'm around guys. I'm tall, so I always think that guys don't want to be around methat they would rather be with a shorter, cuter girl. I mean, Jason is in a frat and he doesn't want me to go to parties with him. That REALLY hurts my feelings. I feel like it's because of a lot of reasons, but the main one being that I'm not pretty enough for him to ""show me"" to his brothers or whatever. Also, because he wants to not be attached to anyone at a party so that he can hook up with other girls for one night standssomething that he tells me he's done before. That really bothers me. He tells me that he's cheated on all of his girlfriends beforeso how do I know that he's not going to cheat on me, too? What assurances do I have???? How can I trust him? Especially when I know that he's done it before? How do I know he won't do it again? Monica tells me ""once a cheater, always a cheater. "" Is she right? Should I not trust him? Do I have a choice?

"okay, this is an interesting assignment. what to write about, there is not much to say. I want to go back home because I am not having to much fun here. I miss my friends and want to sleep in my own bed. keeping in touch takes up a lot of time. oh well asdfjkl;asdfjkl;jjjkl;asdfjum, alreight this is wierd. what am I going to talk about for twenty minutes. ?  well, the food here is really getting discusting, the other day I could have sworn there was a finger in the hotdogs. it made me want to puke, man only three minutes have passed. hmmmmmmmmm. I want ot go home. I just got back yesterday also. I only like the freedom here, it sucks not having a car. I went home and it felt really weird to drive. my rroommate is kind of getting on my nerves, she hasnt done anything but she is just getting on my nerves. she never cleans up and is always on the stupid computer. it just gets on my nerves. like today, she threw away a milk carton in the trash, well if I hadnt have taken the trash down the hall it would have started to smell. also, I'm the only one who brought any functional things. I brought the tv, vcr, answering machine, stereo, vacuum, curtains, rug, etc. she just brought a bunch of junk to clutter everything up and put on my tv. I guess I should stop complaining, but it is really starting to bother me. I might start sounding selfish also, but she doesn't share much and I of course have to let her use my stereo and tv. I also am the only one that really cleans,  this is just bothering me. ot has only been eight minutes. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz I have never done the alphabet on the keybourd before. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz how fun:) well, this day sucks. I'm still tired and I just took a two hour nap. I only have one class today and its from 8-9:30 so I have the rest of the day. I really need to do my math homework, I can't stand the professor. he is not very good at teaching. ahhhhhhhhhhhh I'm so anoyed. I feel like I am writing  a letter. okay, when is this instant messenger thing going to finish downloading. its taking forever, I only want to talk to my friends online. no one is ever really on thoukgh so it doesn't really matter. man, I should have brought my discman. I am never going to catch up on the readings I am supposed to do for english and biology. I missed last friday's bio class because my stupid alarm didnt go off. I had set the clock wrong so it said pm instead of am. I felt so dumb, so now I have a buinch of notes to catch up on. !@#$%^&*() HDJHHFGHLKJHSDjljkLKJHFHFHFNVJDUEKASKJDHFUKTHJLKASJHDHFHFH only seven more minutes??????    okay, I still have bio to read, english to print out, and I still have to finish the survey online for this class. maybe if I type slower the time will go bye more quickly. alright, I can't wait till this weekend because I will have more free time, I really need to meet more people. this is not really helping. :) :(:) :( :) :9:0 messed up  -------+++++++++++++============= I wonder if you can draw pictures  ==  ==        *  -------------   @ its a face sticking its tonge out, how cute ",1
"I'm realizing, as I begin to write this, that this psychology assignment is probably the weirdest thing I've ever had to do for a class. On one hand, it seems utterly useless, but then again, I know nothing about psychology, so I'm fascinated to find out how they can use something like this for scientific purposes. I just got my wind ensemble music about half an hour ago, and I'm already nervous. I'm also really hungry. I should be meeting Ashley for lunch right now in Kinsolving, but I'm doing this assignment instead. Hope she's not mad. I don't think she will be. Christina wanted to eat over there anyway, and I'd like to try their food, so we'll probably go over there for lunch. Maybe not dinner. I have rehearsal tonight for LHB. Dang it. The last thing I feel like doing right now is marching. It's so hot. I really miss Doug. He's been on my mind every once in awhile, ever since I started school. I don't know why I think about him so much. I've tried to deal with these feelings before, and they've gotten better, but only a little bit. I think of him as a friend, but a part of me still likes him a lot. I don't know why. I should know better. He's the last person I'd ever want to date. But maybe that's why I like him so much, that whole ""opposites attract"" theory. I don't know. Actually, it's not that I don't want to date him, but he has so many qualities that I shouldn't like. When I think about his friendship with Carolyn, it always stirs up jealousy inside me. I know I shouldn't get jealous of her. They were such good friends  more than friends  for awhile, and there's no reason that I should mean as much, or more, to him than she does. I should be happy for them. I love carolyn. She's one of my best friends, but at the same time, she drives me crazy. I don't think she realizes how much it hurts me when she talks about how sweet doug is to her and everything. I wish she'd just make up her mind between him and zag. But the more I think about it, the more I don't miss all that crap from high school. I know there are going to be other guys that I meet  I already have met several in LHB  but it's just that I don't know anyone well yet. There's nobody that I can just talk to, or sit beside and listen to them talk, like I did with Doug. I really miss those times when he'd play with my hair or hold my hand or stroke my cheek. All the times carolyn wasn't around. Weird. No, I need to stop thinking like this. What did my book say? I'm supposed to wait for God to put someone in my life. I shouldn't go chasing after guys (like Carolyn does) because that'll only get me hurt. I try so hard to be good and do what my Christian friends say, but I guess it's that human nature that makes me want to do the other things. I'm really getting hungry now. I think she just finished her calculus, so maybe we can go eat when I'm done with this. I wonder if dad ever found my phone last night. I hope I can remember where I put it, because I really need to have it. I wonder how Matthew is doing with his region band music. I'm so nervous for him. I really want him to beat Brandon. No, I don't. I just want him to get some more confidence when he plays in front of people because he is so good. Well, pretty good, at least. If he had some attitude, or if he didn't get so nervous, he'd be awesome. I wish I could fix it for him. Doug has so much confidence. Matthew needs to be more like Doug. In some ways, at least. I miss me. Nicks, too. Sometimes this whole college thing feels temporary, like I'll go back to school in a week, and everything will be normal, and fun, and stressfree. Jennifer and Jean and Rosie are doing a good job, but there are so many things that I wish they could do differently. Conducting bugs me the worst. Or maybe it's just the fact that they've replaced me. I'm no longer needed at Connelly, and that really bothers me. They might miss me, but they don't need me anymore to keep things running, and it hurts to think about that. Of course, it's kind of nice to be at the other end of the spectrum for awhile, and not know what's going on. Being a freshman is nice, to a point, but then it just drives me nuts. I wish I had a tape player so I could listen to Mr. P's tape. I can't believe wind ensemble is starting tomorrow. I wish I had my car down here with me. I feel so isolated, helpless. I'm homesick, but not really. I just miss Doug, I think. I wish I could've seen him this weekend. I can't wait until I make some good friends here, but all the guys I've met so far are so immature. It's frustrating. ",1
"I am so happy to be home right now. College life is fun and all, but I miss the comforts of home. At the dorm, there is always something ""extremely important"" to do at every moment. Someone is always dropping by and visiting or calling on the phone. I have sorority events to go to or a date, or something. I am getting so overwhelmed by it all. I suddenly have so many responsibilities. Like making sure I wake up for class on time, washing my dishes, making sure I eat enough meals, try to fit in studying every once in a while, follow all of my sorority rules at all times. And my current boy situation is so overwhelming. Suddenly, no that I am single, there seem to be an overabundance of guys. They are everywhere and are always giving out their phone numbers. It is so weird to not have a boyfriend since Brandon and I were together for 14 months. To make that situation worse, he is still so present in my life. Our break up was just one of the many major changes in my life with the beginning f college. I know that lots of girls feel the need to ""find themselves"" once in college, and it seemed so bizarre to me before I actually was in their shoes. I mean, don't you know who you are? I thought that I did, but now that everything is so different, I feel very lost and confused about who I am and what types of values/morals I have. Up to this point, every decision I made was affected to some degree by my parents. For example, my 1 a. m. curfew had an extreme affect onm where I went at night, how much sleep I got each night. Also, there were rules on who I went out with, because my parents had to meet them beforehand. Now, I can come and go as I please with no questions asked. I'm not so sure that is a good thing. I mean, just because I am 18, that does not mean I suddenly competent to run my entire life. I miss being able to come home everyday and tell my mom all of my daily triumphs and failures. Although, I think that mom and I talk more now than when I lived at home (not that home is far away, only twenty minutes. We talk almost five times a day. But it is different than having here tuck me in each night and hug me when I am down. What is also so diffucult now is that when I need someone to talk to, all of closest friends are thousands of miles away at their own universities. So, I am left with trying to reveal my emotions to practical strangers that I have formed some sort of bond with. Friendships are difficult and delicat things. I know that everyone is looking for a friend right now, especcially me, and yet true friendships don't just form overnight. They take months to form a feeling of trust and compassion between two people. You cannot just jump in and say ""Oh we are best friends now. "" That is why soroity life is so strange now. I have been thrown into this new ""family"" in which we are all supposed to be friends, and yet I don't even know most of their names. I guess that over time, we will get close, but right now, it is akward. However, I am thankful to have somewhere to go when I get lonely. Which is quiet often now that all of friends are gone. ",1
"Right now it id 9:30 in the morning and I wish that I was still asleep. I had a Biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. I don't really understand what goes on in that class. Science isn't my best subject, but I guess I am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. And if I don't do well in those classes, I can't get accepted into upper divison. I'm not sure. I have been thinking about changing out of nursing because I really want to dance but I just don't think that there is a living in that profession. But at least I would really enjoy it. I wish I were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. He does what he wants because he wants to do it. He isn't worried about his future and I know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. And he is good at it. I just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. I wish I could push myself more, but I just don't have the motivation. I try at least. My classes are really hard and I am worried about doing well in them. This is my first time to be away from home and I want to prove to everyone that I am not as incapable as everyone thinks that I am. My own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. He thinks that I can't hold my own and that I have to depend on everyone else to help me through what I do. And maybe in some aspects that is true. I have had a difficult time just being myslef. I feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what I say isn't as important as the next person. Enough about my problems though, right? Today I am going to get a tattoo. I have always wanted one and I have never had the nerve to go and get one. I think it is going to hurt really bad but I think that I am finally ready for one. I have been looking at what kind I want and printed some out off the computer. I hope that they can do the one that I want. I guess I am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. Today I have 3 classes left to go to. This being one of them. I have a hard time paying attention in this Psychology class. I just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. All of my other classes are just 50 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. But I added this class so 3:30 was the only time that was left open. I had to take it. Thinking about school, I am going to go home and take summer school at SFA. I feel that if I can get some credtis there and transfer them here that it might take some of the load off for next year. I already came with 6 hours but that isn't very many. I am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 2 years. I don't know what I will do if I don't. I guess I will just transfer back home and go to school there if I can't get in here. But I really want to prove that I can get in here. I am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. I read what I am supposed to and work the problems, but I just can't seem to learn the material. I'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. I have never gone a year without dancing. Last year I was dancing 4-6 hours every week day and this is just strange. I don't excerise in any other way than that so I am starting to feel out of shape. Dancing was my way to let everything out. I wasn't always as good as I wish that I could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that I was good at something. Here I can't do that. I am just another person walking down the side walk. At home, in such a small town, everyone knew who I was. And here I think I know about 20 people at the most. None of my friends came here so it isn't like I really have a relase. I am going to go home this weekend, and I know it is kind of soon, but I really miss my boyfriend. Maybe I am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. It might be best if I go home, I know mom and dad would like that a lot more. But I am tired of doing everything for my parents. I never did anything in high school for myself. Mom and I got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life I was just trying to prove myself to her. She treated me like a child even last year, like I was still 12 and couldn't take care of myself. Being an only child I was smothered by my parents and grandparents. I don't know. It was nice getting what I always wanted, but sometimes I wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. It's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. Someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. It doesn't work. Besides, I get tired of writing all of that down. I am super duper hungry right now butI don't want to eat because I am really afraid of the freshman 15. I haven't been eating well lately. I won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when I actually do eat, it isn't anything healthy. The only good we have in our room is gronola bars and froot loops. Like that is healthy. At least I have been drinking a lot of water. Well, my time to write is almost up. Thank God because I am really getting tired sitting here and doing this. Also, I have a class in 15 minutes and I really need to leave and go there. So, I guess I have a couple more of these things to do during the rest of the semester. Fun fun fun, I can't wait. ",1
"     I'm just sitting here in my dorm room wondering what exactly i'm supposed to do on this assignment. Will the professor scold me for writing the incorrect responses?  I'm not sure. I can hear 2 things right now. One in my air conditioner. It sounds like a small, fast moving fan. A fast moving fan that doesn't seem to cool the room at all. I can also hear the neighbors' music through the wall. Now that I think of it, i can hear the soft hum of my computer as well. I'm looking at an award that's hanging on my wall I earned playing tennis for my high school. Now i'm thinking about my high school friends. Steph, Bree, Ki, Ashley, James, Niko, John, and Kenton were my closest friends. I miss them but I'm so excited about my new life. Ryan was my good friend in high school too, but I guess i didn't include him in that list because he's my roomate. I was going to try and not mention Annie, but that's really who I'm thinking about. I met Annie at Camp Texas about a week before school. She's a really wonderful person that I'm very attracted too. I'm looking at a Charlie Brown pez dispencer that she gave to me yesterday. Now I'm staring into my computer with because it has a large plexiglass window on the side. It's quite distracting, really. A jumble of customly installed wires is to me something like a low rider car to another person. Now i see a router that I'm going to use to hook up our network when we get road runner installed in our dorm room. I took 2 years of networking class in high school, and after the first sememster i was convinced that was what i wanted to spend my life doing. However, I recently decided that networking wasn't my true aspiration so I don't really know what I want to do specifically. I'm told that's okay and i will figure it out soon enough, and i beleive it. I think I'm getting kind of sick so i took some medicine earlier and have a bad taste in my mouth from the medicine. Now i'm thinking I should go work out tomorrow at Gregory. My friend told me that there's another good gym near Gregory but there aren't as many girls there. Now I'm wondering what i'm going to write about for my last 10 minutes, I really have no clue. I could explain how I put my computer together, or what each part does. I could talk about my high school tennis experiences, about my family, or about my high school hobbies. My roomate has arrived and i greeted him, he went to his bed and is watching TV, some sort of sports I'm sure. We went to the football game last Saturday. UT won 27-0. UT scored all 27 points in the first half, so the second half was pretty boring. It was still better than I expected for my first college football game. I really want to go see the OU game this year, but tickets are a hot commodity. After this assignment, I'm going to try to do some Economics, and maybe Calculus. This class, Psychology, is the class I'm most worried about this semester. I took Calculus in high school and I think with a little studying I'll be able to make a B in it. I don't know why but I have a great understanding for Economics so I don't think that class will be incredibly hard either. My communications teacher said that her class would be hard, but I think I'm better at communications that Psychology. I also have BA 101 and a Freshman Interest group class but those are pretty much participation grades, so a little time a effort will ensure an A. My schedule is incredible. None of my classes start before 11, and I have Friday's off from school. I find upperclassmen drooling over this schedule, so to find it as a freshman is pretty incredible, I think. As my time winds down I wonder what exactly this class has in store for me. Even college. Heck, even life. I wonder what big decisions I will make, what lucky breaks I will get, what major crises i will encounter, and what disadvantages I will overcome. All I can do is wish myself and my fellow peers luck and great success to find what we truly desire. ",1
"Right now I am very tired, and I really don't know why. I got enough sleep yesterday, but then again I had a very busy day yesterday. It must have been when I went to try out for the texas crew team. I am not sure whether I should join, and it has been bugging me all day. If I join, I will have to sacrifice many things. First off, I would have to get up really early in the morning and I am not use to that. Second, time would be another sacrifice. I would have less time to do other things,  and would have to learn how to manage my time very efficiently. I am really missing the girl that I left back home in order to come attend the university. She was so good to me, never complaining and always doing things for me, even if it was at her expense. We got along great, hardly ever fighting. I miss going to her house every day and talking to her and her parents. Her parents were really good to me also. This girl was going through a really hard time in her life when I met her. I am greatful that I was a big part in helping her get through this time in her life. That time was when her parents were getting divorced. She got through it fairly well, but then her mom remarried quickly. This upset her a great deal. I enjoyed the fact that I could be there for her when she needed me. As a result of her mom's remarriage, she now has a new stepsister and stepfather. Her stepsister is really making her life tough. For that, I resent her stepsister. She disobeys her father and stepmother, steals my girl's clothes, and is a big slut. This girl is named Emily. Emily really pisses me off a great deal. Why does she have to be that way. Nobody has done a damn thing to her, but yet she seems to make the lives if the people around her miserable. I think about my girl quite often, but I know that I am up here for the reason of getting an education. I don't know whether I should move on and try to find someone new, or hold off and just visit her when I am home. But while I am in Austin, the main thing to concentrate on is my studies. It seems that my classes are going to be somewhat difficult. At first I was bit scared, but I know I can come out on top if I put the work and time in. It is sometimes hard to manage time between working out, studying, and having a good time. But it can be done. I am slowly learning the things necessary to become a good student here at UT. I plan to do the best that I can possibly do, and hopefully, if god is willing I will make it through alright. Wow, it has already been twenty minutes and I've got to make a class. ",1
I tried to get onto your pretest experimental thing and it didn't let me on that's very bad for m e since I will have to waste more damn time tomorrow doing it I heard it takes a long time to do. This whole college thing is really starting to scare me I missed my Si session today for Rtf and let myself down. I f you want to make an impression on these people you have to grab them by the balls with a 4. 0 average. How am I going to do that when I have already missed one of the damn Si's  I'm telling you I better get my act  What am I even doing here I need to get my mind on other things like movies why aren't your thoughts ever on movies they're always on what to do to impress the next person . Just get ahead of thy game early and you'll do fine  God I hope I get a $. 0. $. 0 the way to go. I don't want grad school though California Vivian Yeah that's where I'm going to be in a while no matter what. I have it the right stuff. Ed Harris. Good movie. Remember what the guy at Northwestern said The Right Stuff had god use of parallel editing. where you edit two frames together that are similar in how the shot is set so as not to disrupt the audience's attention. What is the audience's attention . Movies. this paper what am I rambling about I wonder if the proff will read this Jesus you type like a gorilla . Sigourney Weaver Gorillas in the Mist about some ape lady Aldrich something. Ironic that was in our psychology book. ironic but not funny just ironic sue me I took a pause to see how much time I had left this is all anyway what is it supposed to prove that our mind wanders is it supposed to give us some great insight into how we think  rrAAh. it is pretty fun and it will be interesting to read over this am I supposed to wow I'm a slow typist that sucks. What was it sophomore year that I got a B in keyboarding yeah I told Chad Crady about Stephanie McKinnon and we always used to fight each other in class and he'd pretend that I was beating him up why are you and all of these people so concerned about each other especially women is it just to procreate that we are interested in women or is it like Psychology. professor says that there can be different views on the whole thing. Of course dumb question there can be different views on every thing but which is the right one?  time up ,1
"I'm very tired right now. I know that I have not been getting the amount of sleep that I need. Is this how college is all the time?  Over this past weekend, I realized that I am beginning to get very homesick. I really miss my family, friends, and my dog. I started crying when I was on the phone with my brother earlier today. School is getting stressful, especially with band. I got a letter today saying I needed to work more on my routines. I don't know what to do. I've already put off so much, and gotten behind because of band. I practice and try to keep up with my studies. I think I really need to focus myself a little more. Sometimes I think it is the new freedom that is causing this. I know what I need to do, I just need to get motivated to do them. I also need to learn how to not procrastinate. I've been thinking a lot about Andrew lately, and about the church. I'm still so indecisive about what to do. Sometimes I think that I believe and sometimes I think that I'm really not sure. Now I'm thinking about death. I don't think there is anything I fear more than that, and what's sad is I know that everyone must pass through it. It terrifies me. I would never take my own life. I'm too scared of what's after, and I love my life to much. Even with all of the stress I still find things interesting. I am still proud of the things I have achieved. I have very high goals for myself and I am so excited about the future. There are so many things to look forward too. Why do people get depressed?  I've never been one to be truly unhappy. Even when there are times I said I was depressed"" I never really was. It makes me sad to think that people can get so down about themselves. I was talking to Chris yesterday, and reading his online journal thing. It made me want to cry. I don't see how he thinks he will never find the right person, or be successful in life. He is such a wonderful person, and has so many things going for him. Why don't people see that? Why can't they see that even with all of the bad in the world there is still good?  You know that makes me think. I am so obsessed with my life and what I do and the people I know. I think that everyone is just as worried about their life and their friends and family as I am. We all live in our own world, in our own bubble, our own space. I think that this assignment is pretty cool. I actually do this quite often. Just start writing things down. Oh man!  I just thought of what I was writing last week, about the first football game. I don't think I could ever described the rush when I marched through that tunnel. It was so crazy with over 80,000 people there in one place. watching the band march in. I had the room to myself this weekend. My roommate went out of town. It was nice. I love being with people and being with my friends, but I also really enjoy my quite time and my personal time. My roommate is really nice. I feel I've been blessed because we get along so well. I haven't met as many people as I thought I was going to meet up here. well. I guess I have met people, but I haven't made as many friends as I thought. Friendships just take time though. I really wish Michelle was here. I miss her. I was so glad we worked everything out before we went our separate ways. She is always been such a great friend. I respect her so much. I don't know what I would do with myself if it had been my mom. That is another one of my big fears. losing a loved one. When Michelle's mom died so suddenly a couple of years ago we were all so shocked. I don't think there was one of us that didn't give our own Mom's huge hugs the day we found out. I was so upset, and Michelle had me call everyone and tell them. That was so hard. So many people thought it was a cruel joke. Why do people do that?  Go into denial. I guess I would have if somebody had called me and told me that. That was two years ago. Time flies so fast. It doesn't even seem like two years. Only like yesterday. Sometimes I wish we could just freeze time. During those special moments or the happiest time. just make time stop. even if it just added and extra minute, I think it would be nice. Oh look, my time is almost up. ",1
"     So the first week of school has begun and I am not ready at all!  I already feel like I am loosing my mind. Which is not a good way to start off the school year. I am taking some interesting classes though with what seem like some pretty cool professors. First, I am taking CMS 306M, which is a speech class, and that doesn't seem like it will be too hard. Then I am taking ECO 304K with an amazing professor. I am very excited about this class but I have heard that it is a little difficult so I will definatly have to pay attention and study. I am also taking a geography class about weather and climate and my professor is Troy Kimmel-the weather man!  So I am excited about that because he seems like a fun person!  I am also taking EDP369K which is a community service class. We have to do community service every week for at least 4 hours. I think the professor sets us up with backgrounds that are unfamiliar to us and then we go to this business/place and get to experience those things that we normally wouldn't. This class should be interesting. I think it will really give a good perspective of what other people have to go through and it will help me not be so selfish. This class is just something I need to take. Finally, I am taking your PSY class which I am very excited about as well!  Pennebaker seems very laid back and cool. With the music at the beginning of each class, etc. I don't know, I think I might surprise myself and acctually enjoy physcology (however that is spelled). I really need to catch up on my reading sometime soon. I am a sophomore so I am not as scared as I was last year. Last year I was very intimidated so I studied all the time and read every assignment that was passed my way-and in return I ended up with a 3. 888 (which my parents are enthused about!)  But this year I am not as intimidated, so that could either be a good thing or a bad thing. I just really need to get out of the summer mode where I go out every night and do nothing but work and party. I need to calm down and study/read a bit more than I am now. I think I will be okay though because school has only been in session for a few days. So hopefully Ill get my act together soon. Anyway, on a lighter note tonight was our first Chapter Meeting. That's right, I am in a sorority-Alpha Chi Omega-and I love it!  We just went through RUSH where we got all of our new members and they are absolutly amazing. My little Alpha Sis is the sweetest most cool girl ever!  She knows how to control her school work but she also knows how to have a good time!  I just love her. Next week we get our Chi Sis' and then a few weeks after that we get our Omega Sis' then at the end of that we get to chooose our Lil' Sis'-which will be ours for the rest of our college years. So this semester should be very exciting!  This year I am living in the AXO house with my pledge class of '03 and I wasn't so sure about it last year but I really love it!  I am getting to know my Pledge Class SO much better which really brings us closer and actually gives me the pride of calling them my sisters-however corny that may sound!  Haha. Anywho, we have a date dash on Thursday and I am not sure which boy to take!  haha. I always seem to have boy problems. But o well, that's all part of being a college student (I guess). Anywho, there is this one boy who is a Sigma Chi and is halarious and so much fun to be around. And really cute but then there is a Wrangler whos name is Matt who I kind of talked to last semester. He use to be our house boy and we even went on a date earlier before school started. Well even though he may be good to look at he really doesn't have much of a personality!  Which really sucks. I think he's just really shy or something but he always mumbles and doesn't have a whole lotta interesting things to say. I mean, don't get me wrong he is a super sweet guy and I tottally trust him. And he's 21 (haha). But I can't help it if I am not attracted to someone. I mean in reality personality is everything even if this guy is amazing to look at. But in a way I feel like I owe it to him to invite him to our date dash. But then again I don't want to lead him on and then ""break"" his heart. Because that's just cruel!  Okay, then there is another guy who reminds me of my ex-boyfriend (but in a good way). He is super cute and very interesting. I think I could hold several very interesting/intelligent conversations with him. I think he could teach me a lot about life in general. Anywho, my sweetmate introduced me to him and she really wants me to take him to this Date Dash and I would LOVe to go with him but I feel like I owe it to these other guys, that I have been spending more time with. So right now I am a very confussed person-and considering it is Monday night I kind of need to make up my mind really fast. Okay, so there's the Sigma Chi-names Forest-who is one of those guys that is supper fun but not long-term quality. Then there's Matt-the Wrangler-who is so nice but I would feel quilty leading him on by inviting him. Then there is Ryan who is someone I look very much foward to getting to know better. So we shall see how things go. I know everything happens for a reason so I will just follow my heart now and either way things will work themselves out!  Right??  Well, I have now been typing non-stop for 18 minutes. I guess I had a lot to get off of my cheast. This is a good assignment because it always us to do what we should do every day. just let it all out!  Haha, good idea!  O yeah, I tried signing up for an experiment project but then I realized I signed up for the wrong day so I hope that doesn't affect my grade. Whopps!  O well, there's nothing I can do about that now. This weekend is our first home football game which I am very excited about!  We play North Texas and we should whopp some beee-hind!  I can't wait~ ",1
"Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness     paper. I still haven't really figured out yet what I will write about, but I suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. That's good I guess,     right. Sure. It's cold in the computer lab here. It's always cold in this lab. And it's     always cold in the library. In most places throughout the University, in fact, it is     cold. It is especially cold in the student union. I mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. There is one place, however, that I have found is     not cold - it is hot. My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. And it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. One thing I     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. This is very good     news. Hopefully it will continue to get cooler. So looking at the timer at the top of     this page, I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic, nor have I     even begun to write on a topic. It's just meaningless facts from my mind. I'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean. There must be some     point for this. Hopefully at least. So far my classes have been pretty good. I don't     have a huge workload yet. I assume that it will pick up eventually. Especially next     semester. From Laurel's experience, I have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. Actually, I am quite certain that it will be rough. I     will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which I know will be hard. Oh well, I can handle it. I am enjoying school,     though. It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in     my life. All the freedom and extra time. I just like the atmosphere that is college. It's fun and different. Well only five minutes have gone by so far. I'm still a little     hungry. I should have had more lunch. Oh well. I only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. That's not too bad. I am writing on a     Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. I am used to a program fixing it all for     me. Oh well I suppose it's good for me. But this sticky keyboard is not. Geez!  If     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. And they crazy IMer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. It's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  One good thing I will say is that     Macintosh's do look pretty cool. I like the whole clear theme. I also like the     widescreen. It's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. I think the clock on the     computer is slow. After 20 real"" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. So for every ""real"" minute, 75 seconds go by. So in a 20 minute writing sample, I     must actually write for about 25 minutes. See I thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. I thought that my watch said 12:01 when I started, and now it is     12:37 and I still have 2 minutes to write. Maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. That's crazy. I have a one o'clock     class. I hope that my ""2"" minutes doesn't last too much longer. Well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. I have to say that     I have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. I     don't know that I like it that much either. I have noticed that when I type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. So I have been writing for a     loooong time. Ok, my time is up. Bye. ",1
"What time is it. I need to be at the house at ten. My mouth feels like the sensation you get right before you throw up. They say that Gatorade is a thirst quencher but why does it make your mouth so dry. It is so quiet right now. As I stare at my roommates applied calculus book I am lost in the colors. The bright colors formed in various shapes and sizes make a maze for my wandering eyes. I wonder what I have to write for the other assignment. God, I could really use a shower. It seems like I have been sweating all day. I wonder where my roommates are and what they are doing?   My roommates are slobs. I feel as if I am in a sea of clothes as I sit here on my roommates computer. I wonder if that picture of Bevo was ever really a picture that was taken by somebody or was it all just from computers. If it was a picture that was taken I wonder what that bull was thinking. he was probably thinking how ridiculous humans are. Actually, he was probably thinking where the best area in the pasture to eat grass is. I don't like this assignment very much. I feel like some druggy. Look at the colors man, and all the shapes. I don't know. It's kind of cool to put down on paper the th9ings you are thinking. ",1
"today if the first Sunday that I have been here alone and it is interesting because I dont have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do. I can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette. this is different because before I would have to think up an excuse to go and have one. my feet are cold right now and I need to take a shower. I didn't get up till about 11:45. the MTV music video awards and not very exciting and I am tired of listening to all of these peoples memories about their favorite moments. they, the awards are just a simple kind of propaganda. Michael Jackson does like little boys and should stop trying to cover it up with all those insignificant women. the only reason he wants children are for the obvious. it sucks he has that kind of problem. many people do like to eat corn but they dont seem to serve it here in the jester cafeteria. I wonder if this is going to get through because I cant even send my mom an email. it would suck if it didn't. this is the largest class I have ever been in. I hope it is the most interesting. I need to check how much money is in my account. I came with alot and am still wondering how much I will leave with. Dana Carvey is a funny guy and I figure he had a bad childhood because his brother is a bearded man who rarely says a word. I miss running track. I need to go and workout but will when Im done. Hanson is the most ridiculous group in the whole world. if they can make it I know that I can. I am really infatuated with this girl and hope that I run into her again, actually there are two that I am. Eddie Murphy is a pimp. I cant believe that princess Diana died. I think that she staged her own death to get away from the photographers. she had been harassed her whole life and would have and could have been driven to such extremes. I do not know how long I've been writing but will keep writing for another ten minutes. I feel like Beavis and butthead because I am verbalizing all of my thoughts. I stayed up till three oclock last night and still slept nine hours. the song by Aerosmith, dude look like a lady, is it about a homosexual or a crossdresser. is cross dresser one or two words. I still think that notorious b. i. g. and tupac are still alive. I need to get the c. d. tom petty and the heart breakers greatest hits because I miss listening to them. I still seems I havent written that much. van halen is so cool, not. this is ridiculous my thoughts. Daisy fuentes is hot and Im glad that she is not bald. what is Marilyn masons deal ?>????. he is a freak and I had the pleasure of meeting him and his band in the theatre. he was busy throwing gummy worms at the people attempting to watch star wars. he reminded me of a lost child. maybe thats why he dresses like he does. he is a freak. the chocolate milk in the cafeteria is good. I kind of want to go to breakfast tomorrow because I have never eaten in the morning in the cafeteria. I have done absolutely nothing today and I thoroughly like it. I do need to go and take a shower because that would be proper. I wonder how many people only take showers every other day. I wonder if commercials actually do influence the ways people buy products. that's it has been twenty minutes. ",1
"I just finished working out. It was pretty tiring. I haven't worked out in awhile. It's kind of cold in the room right now. I'm always cold. I dont' really know why. It's kind of weird. I miss Freddy so much. Gosh, this webcam thing might not be so good. It's good that I can see and talk to him, but everytime I do see and talk to him, I just get sad. I want him here with me, but he's so far away. sigh. oh well. at least I'll see him at Thanksgiving. That will give me something to work forward to. Hmmm. My sister's husband is here for the weekend. It's still really weird. I can't imagine my sister married. It's quite strange. But she seems happy, so it's good. I feel bad that her friends are taking better care of her than I am though. Kind of makes me feel bad. But I'll babysit when the twins are due, so maybe that will make up for it. I'm going to work really hard this sememster. I have nothing else to do really. I can't go clubbing or to any parties or have one on one with any guy friends. With is kind of poopy. Because I actually get along better with guys. But it's ok, because he can't do anything either. I was going to write something and I just forgot what. I do that a lot. I'll like so upstairs or something and then I'll forget why I went upstairs. Yeah, it's pretty strange. Hmm. the tv is going on in the background. It's a pretty funny show. I need to go to the bathroom. I just drank a lot of water. But I still have like 15 minutes left on the clock. Wow. 20 minutes is a long time when you're just typiung random thoughts. I'm not homesick at all. I knew I probably wouldn't be. I've always been the independent type. Pipit is a pretty good roommmate. We dont' have the same friends or anything and we dont' hang out really, so I don't think we'll get sick of each other or annoyed with each other. She's out of the room a lot, so that's good too. I'm always on the webcam, so I guess its' good that she goes out or I think she'd be really annoyed. I havent' really met anyone new yet. I guess going ot UT does that to you. You stay in your comfort zone and it just takes too much effort to get out of it. Plus, it's weird. Even when I'm hanging out with friends or something, I'll start wanting to go back into my room to talk on the webcam. Man, I'm such a nerd. Haha, oh well. I think calculus will be my hardest class. I hate math. Ugh, at least I will have no more math after this class. woohooo. well, except that i'm doing accounting, which is a lot of math. But it's like simple math. So I'll be ok. At least no more integration in my entire life. goodness, that will be good to get rid of. Ahhh. . only halfway finished with the time. I tend to do that a lot too. I always look at the time. Even though i pretend not to. I still do out of the corner of my time. It's like I try to trick myself. But it's doesnt' really work so much. hehe. A lot of people are gone for the church retreat. I dunno. I kind of of wanted to go, because I didn't go last year, but I'm just not very comfortable with the church anymore. I feel like all they do is judge you. The pastor and the counselors and everybody just look down on you if you're not a servant leader or if you don't serve or if you don't talk to them and tell you all their problems. Yeah, I think it's pretty dumb. It's makes me really mad sometimes. They have no right to judge. My spiritual life is between me and God and no one else. uughh. Yeah, but I think I'm going ot find a new church when I go back from college. That will be good for me I think. Steven is iming my sister right now. I still feel kind of bad for him. They went out for like 3-4 years and then my sister marries someone else. But it's for the better. THey fought like everyday and he would always cry. SO that's not too healthy either. I miss my doggies too. Dusty Babulee Chen and even Mocha. Awww. my Dusty. I want him here to keep me company. I think Dusty is the only one who knows all my secrets. Because I know he won't tell anybody, considering he's a dog. He's so old already. It's going ot be so depressing when he passes away. That's going to be one sad day. I had a bad dream last night. Freddy dream-cheated on me. Man, that sucked. I was sooo mad when I woke up. I must be really insecure or something. THis is the second time I've dreamt that he's dream-cheated on me. Hahaha. That's pretty funny. It kind of sucks that my boyfriend and one of my really good guy friends hate each other. With a passion too. It's pretty bad. But Freddy has nothing to worry about, that's so gross. Rex is like a brother and I think of him as a girl too. I wonder if he knows?  He should. people always make fun of him about it. But maybe he just think we're kidding or something. Hmmm. maybe we should tell him. Dang, my hands are gettting really tired form typing. I don't think I exactly have the right technique. I wish I still played piano like before. I want to relearn the Chopin song. Maybe I will. . if I motivate myself to. That would be really good. That music class is pretty simple though. I hope these 3 months until Thanksgiving so really really fast. I cant' wait to see Freddy. Man, I think about him a lot. ",1
"I am writing an assignment for psychology. Stream of consciousness. What am I thinking right now? What am I thinking for the next twenty minutes? Chris is watching the television. Wresting. WWF. Idiots in spandex. T. V. is slowly killing us off. The announcer's scream. Loud, emotional, fake. Why do people watch it? Reality is more fun when it's fake. Big brother. Survivor. The real world. I hate the real world. True strangers, picked to live in a house, and devour each other alive. Devour. I want some ice cream, but I'm not hungry. They had Mexican food for supper tonight. There was a band playing. A Mexican band. I didn't like it. Music. Radiohead's new cd comes out October 3. Hell yeah! Kid A is the name of it. If I could be in any band it would be Radiohead. The television is distracting me. Wrestlers coming to the ring from the future. Futuristic wrestlers, live on television. And some people still believe it. Chris just changed the channel. MTV now. Carson Daly, and his Total Request Live. I'm ashamed of my generation. I feel sorry for Britney Spears, N'Sync, and all the other pop groups that greedy business men package to be sold. In five years where will they be? The kids who love them now will laugh at them, and call them queers, has beens. Telephone is ringing. Chris answered it. It's for him. He rarely gets a phone call. I get all the calls. The end of my twenty minutes is coming up. Fifteen seconds, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. ",1
"At this present, I am feeling a lot of stress. I don't know why. There is so much going through my head right now, that I sometimes get confused. Maybe I'm just worrying about my grades and how my four years will come along at UT. I am concentrating at this screen, but feel kind of dazed and a little lonely. Come on now, hurry up and get through this. I am very strict on myself when it comes to following through with things. A few days ago, I took a quiz in my Bio 211 class. I don't think I did very well on it, and it's still nagging on me like an itch on my back that I can't reach. I have very high expectations of myself. I guess that's because of the way I was brought up, and the way I handled myself through my other years of schooling. In my high school, I was second in my class. I was that type of person who always had to get straight A's. Making a B was absolutely unacceptable in my mind. This had nothing to do with my mom. She really doesn't care what I get. I and only I brought on this extreme pressure that I put on myself. I guess if you're in a habit of always making good grades, it's a habit that's very hard to break. That is how I come to terms with my behavior and attitude towards work. I hate feeling awkward. I am very selfconscious. I don't know if it has to do with me being very shy, or what, but I get nervous easily. Sometimes I feel everyone is looking at me waiting for me to make a mistake. This happens to me wherever I go. Well, I'm getting a little tired and my head is starting to hurt. Maybe it's because I've been staring at this screen already for about ten minutes straight. I don't know. About my opinions about UT: I think it's a good school. The only complaint I have is the heat. It is very hot here. I don't remember it being this hot in Houston. I always wonder when the next cool day will come. When I first came here, I felt pretty homesick. Everything was new to me, and when I thought of the new responsibilities that I would have to grasp during the next four years, that really made me sweat. Not literally, but you get the idea. Now, I'm feeling pretty good. I am a very detailed oriented person. I write everything on lists, which includes my shortterm goals, my longterm goals. Everything. And every time I think of something else that I have to do in the near or distant future, I put in on a sheet of paper. I am really nervous about my future. I hope I will live beyond the expectations I have placed upon myself. I am really getting stressed out just thinking about it right now. My head feels like it's filled with cement at this moment. I got to relax and not take the mistakes I make too seriously. I am always serious. I am not a flamboyant person. Well, my twenty minutes are up now. Time to study. ",1
"I don't know a lot of people in every one of my classes and that makes me nervous and anxious. I guess I also am feeling very excited too. I am away from home, from parents and rules, and away from people I know. I like familiarity. That is like a comforting thought to me. I can't stand the fact that this school is so huge that I don't even know where my next class is. All I want to do is curl up in my dorm bed and stay there. Even though I don't like my bed at all because it isn't like mine at home, it will do. I am excited about the weekend that is coming up. I get to go home and see my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. I wake up every day from the day I got here to look forward to this weekend. I don't know why, but I guess I am lonesome. In addition, I didn't make the Longhorn Band, which was very upsetting to me. I am very upset that I didn't make it because I knew I could have. It's just that in the back of my mind, I knew that if I make Longhorn Band, I wouldn't be able to go home to visit as much I want to. So, I really didn't give the audition my best shot because, as much as I wanted to make it, I didn't want to just as much. No matter which way I looked at that, I guess I feel good that I didn't make it and I regret it because I wanted to make it also. That was a conflicting feeling that was bothering me too. Another thing that scares me is that I made the decision to take Chemistry even though I did rather poorly in high school. But something in me just wanted to take it and prove to myself that I wasn't dumb in Chemistry. I just am stubborn when it comes to giving up. I can't stand it when I can't finish something or I am not good at something that I could be. Maybe that's why I am so confused about the Band thing. No matter what, I want to kick myself for not making it, but on the other hand, I am jumping for joy because I know I won't be as stressed out and have time to do stuff. I was in Band all through high school and I guess I decided to continue in college because it was a familiar thing for me. Plus, I had such a bad experience with band directors that I was rather wary of the ones here. But I made such great friends in Band that I am afraid that I won't have any while I am here not in Band. Another thing that worries me is that everyone tells me that I will change and stuff and they say things like, ""Oh, you're probably going to 6th Street and party all the time. ""  Even as a joke, I found that very insulting. How do they know that I will change?  Yes, it's true that I may change, but I have rigid moral standards that were inhibited in me from the day I was born so I don't think the changes will be that drastic or horrifying. Whenever anyone says that, I get really annoyed and frustrated. Another major thing I worry is whether I will ever get used to the fact that I am no longer living at home with the ""comfort zone"" that I was accustomed to. I mean, I am afraid to go home and find out that people over there changed a lot too. It's troublesome to me. Like Chemistry. I also worry about the fact that NONE of the clocks run together and classes end at varying times. I am so scared to walk into a class late, making the professor mad or annoyed. That's another fear of mine that I can see happening and I worry very much about it. That is why I tend to run out of classes, even though I have plenty of time. I am the typical goody-goody that never disobeyed the parents and had many people that had high standards for. So I hope I don't let them down while I am here. No matter what, I can't help that I am who I am for others. I am the oldest of three kids and my parents always told me to set a good example for my younger siblings. If I screw up, they will too, as I was told. You have no idea what kind of pressure that is to me. I hope that I don't let anyone down, especially myself, whoever that is. ",1
"     Usually when you know that you have to do something, you usually think about that something, you usually think about that something and wonder, ""How am I going to do it?  Where do I start?  Where do I finish?  How do I know that I am doing it right?""  This is my situation exactly with this writing assignment. Its the middle of the week and the weekend is almost here. I can't wait till Saturday because I will attend the first UT football game this season, which I might add, will be my first time to attend one. The weeks go by so slow in the fall semester compared to when I was up here for summer school. Its a real drag. I'm always so tired I hate it. Labor day is this weekend, really looking forward to the four day weekend and getting some time to rest. Maybe I'll go visit Brett (an El Paso friend) at the hidious A & M, College Station, the drive is a drag though. The road trip that me and Lianne went on last weekend to go visit up there was sort of fun, but people down there are really rude and it just bugs the hell out of me. All they're concerned about is putting UT down or ""TU"" as they call us since we're not ""THE"" University of Texas but ""A"" Texas University!  Isn't it stupid. Still admit I'm upset about them breaking the horns of my longhorn emblem on my car. Its sad how immaturity can get the best of people. They do have a lot of school spirit. Makes me wish that I was into that stuff. Who knows, maybe when all the football games start. I want to see how crazy us Longhorns really get. I can't wait till softball games start, I want to see all their home games to see what it takes to be on the team!!  Hopefully next year, after a lot of hard work and practice to get back into it, I will be ready to try out. I'm really discouraged about trying out this year, I know I'm not ready. My family's encouragement helps but I don't want to make a fool out of myself. I can just imagine being out on the field suited out in a UT uniform. How amazing. That is my goal!!  If I can be one of the best players in my city, why wouldn't I have a shot on the team. I just think that I lack a lot of skill to be playing at the university level. It may be outstanding for high school, but college ball is a totally different game. I love being away from home to go to school, there is so much more freedom. Don't have to be home at a certain time, don't have to check in. I love it. There are a lot more responsibilities though, but I'm picking up on the time management. The Incubus concert is coming up and I'm (since yesterday) going. I've only heard a few songs by them so I can't say that I'm an ""all out"" fan of theirs. But hey I'm open to the experience, it's going to be my first real concert. I should really save my money, but hey, why not just do it. Its worth the experience. ",1
"I wonder what this assignment is about. the tv is on and some stupid commercial is going on I need to go get some dinner by 7:00. wow that's a nice car on tv, I need to earn some money so I can get a better car. that reminds me my car is still broken down at taco bell and I need to call them and tell them not to tow it or I need to get it towed to a shop like the pep boys across the street man cars suck when they're not running I really wish I had lots of cash so I could buy a more reliable newer one I should call that guy tomorrow about the job so I can earn more money my mind hit a blank spot where I can't really think about anything. then how am I typing if I'm not paying attention to anything? I must be paying attention to something because I'm typing or maye I'm just doing it unconsciously I'm thirsty I need to get something to drink but I can't leave my desk ther's some water right there I'm goin to grab it as soon as I finish this thought how long has it been? only 7 or 8 minutes I need to organize my thoughts and my bedroom, they're both messy that pizza on tv looks really good hey I have a coupon for a free pizza maybe I should order one I wonder if they will deliver a free pizza or they will probably make me pick it up how far is the nearest pizza hut I think only a few blocks away but I should save that for when I'm out of cash and really tired of dorm food I think I already am tired of it but I will be more tired of it in a few weeks my eyes are kind of itchy I guess it's probably allergies saturday night live is on tv it's pretty funny I wonder what it would be like to be in the saturday night live cast I bet there are all kind of hidden relationships and tensions between the characters that go on behind the scenes like with Chris Farley from the older cast how much time has passed I've got about 5 minutes left then I will stop and look at the second assignment and if it won't take too long then I'll do it before dinner but if not I probably wont get to it for a few days because of all of the things I have to do in the next few days let me figure out what I need to do. I need to get my books, call that guy, deal with my car, clean my room, e-mail my friend from high school, check to see if my camera has arrived if not I need to e-mail that guy and see what's taking so long what are they doing on tv that's strange what else do I need to do lets see. I need to go to my classes and go get some groceries, talk to my parents about the money I owe them damn I need to find a way to get lots of cash to repay my debts and buy some of the stuff I've wanted for so long I haven't actually bought anything I just wanted to buy in probably a year because of all the money I owe I should have worked more last summer but I guess its ok that I didn't because I was sick for most of it I'm so tired of getting sick it really makes me angry and tense about things ok what time is it okay I've been writing for about 22 minutes I guess that's enough now I'm going to stop this and finish up this assignment ",1
"okay Im writing this stream of consciousness things and it's 11:57 and god my roommate is sick as hell she's got this nasty head cold and I hope my typing isn't keeping her up god I wish people wouldn't pound their feet when they go up and down the stairs I wonder if my computer was a bad idea when I decided to place it right by the window oh god I think I am bothering my roommate she just sat up but now she's laying back down again I wonder if Ill get cold tonight with the fan on cause a cold fronts coming through I feel a little drainage in my throat I hope Im not catching my roommates cold oh god I hope tomorrow wont be boring or mundane god it's only 12:00 I never realized how hard it is to write for 20 minutes this mouse pointer is annoying me I want to move it but I dont want to stop writing thud somebody's making thud noises outside god that fan is loud oh I can't stop writing because if I did it would be unethical or shit my roommate just made a very weird snorting sound it must suck to have a nasty head cold your first week of school Im looking at my water bottle wishing we had an ozarka bottle in our dorm I was mildly planning on drawing up a petition with the other girls in order to get one I was also toying with the idea of creating a petition to get better food in the cafeteria or whatever god I can't wait to use the sorority koozie I got on bid day for some reason I don't like flashing around and advertising the fact that Im in a sorority, not that Im not proud of my sorority it's just that it seems such a confining statement to be making to the rest of the world who reads my T-shirt I mean Im no longer Lindsey (blank) but I am sorority girl and so many connotations accompany such a title so Id rather start a point 0 with people instead of increasing their preconceived notions of my personality because of my tee shirt god it's only 12:07 boy Ive never written so much bullshit in my life there goes my roomie again with her congested self I wonder if Ill be able to swing this college life I mean I want to do well so well so I can prove it to my mom that I can do it yet I want to party a lot I know that sounds real deep and profound anyway my back is starting to ache because I still havent attached the back part to my computer chair b/c this task requires me to use some tool that I don't have in my possession at the moment so my computer chair kind of acts a rolling piano stool type dealie, speaking of computers I put this damn computer desk together with my own bare hands and boy am I proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 12 and Im not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because Ive risen before 10:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 8 hours of sleep Im one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if Im wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, Im so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that Im off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and Im signing off!

"This writing assignment seems a little silly. I mean I'm probably going to spend the first 10 minutes of this thinking about the actual assignment and that doesn't seem very interesting. Actually I'm already thinking about something else. I can't wait for Austin City Limits. We keep forgetting to buy tickets, I need to write that down. I highly doubt it will sell out but I want to hurry up and buy them. Jack Johnson is so good. I can't wait to see him. We definitely need more decorations in our room. Fifty percent of our walls are still blank and its sort of depressing. Maybe that poster sale is still going on. Maybe I'll have my mom send some of my posters from home. I need to remember to call my mom later. I wonder if she misses me a lot. Oh god, it's only been 3 minutes. This is getting a bit boring. I really hope surprising Brian was a good idea. I just hope Doug doesn't give it away. Hell, I hope I don't give it away! I wonder if I'm doing this assignment right. oh well Pennebaker said himself that no one was probably going to read it. I need to do some calculus after this. I'm so pumped I actually understood it today Hopefully it'll stay like this. I'm so worried about the tests in that class. Ill be so pissed if that class brings down my grade. damnit I keep hitting something that makes the cursor jump lines its so annoying. I just love Jack's voice, its so soothing. Its hard to write as you think. My thoughts are moving faster than my fingers. I hope the other surveys I do online aren't as stupid as the one I just did. I'm happy I guess, though, that it was so hard to name things I was dissatisfied with in my life. I couldn't even think of ten. I made up half of them. well not exactly made up but they weren't things I was actually stressing over. Was that even close to being grammatically correct? 7 minutes 30 seconds. ahhh I hope this weekend is fun. I'm looking at the football stadium out my window. I'm excited for my first UT football game ever. It better be good. I hope our seats are good. I wonder what Kelly's sister will be like. hopefully fun and easy to talk to. I hope I meet a lot of people at the meeting I'm going to tonight. Hopefully guys to be exact. Although I bet its going to be a lot of chicks since its the university democrats. I hope not everyone is a hippie/chip on their shoulder/ socialist type. I mean I hope they're intelligent and not just the ""being different for the sake of being different type"" 10 minutes. half way there Yay! I'm really worried about Laura I hope she finds her dream job soon. I hate seeing her depressed because I know she is but she doesn't talk about it. I hope her and dell are working out. he can be so oblivious sometimes. Aren't most guys? My first instinct is to treat this like an essay and explain who I am talking about but I don't think this is supposed to be like an essay. What the hell would a shrink get from reading this crap? It can't be very interesting to anyone else. I need to go DVD shopping, our DVD collection is seriously lacking. I hope raising our beds isn't that hard. we definitely need a change in our room. I think I want another bowl of lucky charms but I suppose I should finish this thing first. 4. 99 for a box of lucky charms! what a rip. I guess I should have know Cypress would be like that. I should ask Kelly if she wants to go to the grocery store tomorrow. It sucks not having a car down here. I miss my jeep. Its going to feel weird to drive when I get home. I can't freaking wait!! 6 more minutes. I guess its going pretty fast. This thing just seems like a waste of time but I guess it must have some purpose if we have to do it. I actually need to finish reading for this class. can't forget to do that. wow looking at what I've wrote my thoughts seem pretty disorganized. Hmm what does that say about me? I think being a therapist would suck. I wouldn't be able to listen to depressed people whine all day long. wow that sounded terrible. But I suppose its true. Maybe I'm just not patient enough 4 minutes I need to figure out how my scanner works. I need to take pictures so I can send them to my family. my fingers are starting to get tired. I've typed a lot. I still haven't found light bulbs for my stupid Ikea lamp. Maybe we can go to target tonight I think my punctuation and spelling as gotten worse as I went along. oh well. I think he said that we don't need any of that. 2 minutes Thinking about my thoughts is hard, I'm like freezing up. I wonder what would happen if I hit the finish button now. I'm not going to try it because after all of this I want my credit for this assignment! I wish I was disciplined (spelling??) enough to keep a journal. It would be fun to go back and read stuff like 5 years later. I always start it and never pick it up again. I wonder what that says about me? I'm busy. ohhhh 50 seconds! I wonder what the FBA meeting will be like. hopefully nice people will be there I wonder how much of a commitment it is. hopefully  ",1
"As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 12 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK1) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at Gregory. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough. I have sympathy for them. I hope that I can get everything done today that needs to be done and also I plan on changing my shirt before this CK1 gives me a headache. I probably will never wear CK1 again. I hope all my friends and family are doing well. I plan to get some good sleep tonight also, of course after all my work is done. time is running out so bye. ",1
"I am feeling very confused at this point in my life. I am thinking about my future and my career. I am also very nervous about my classes and how much effort each class will require of me. I miss having the reassurance of my friends and family. People say that things get better but at this point I don't see that happening. I am glad that I came to this school because if my parents had made me go to a smaller, local university then I would have always wondered what it would be like to come here. Now that I am here I am sure that I was better off at a smaller school. But I think I will really enjoy what I learn about other people while I am here. At the present moment I am having to learn time management. I have load of work to do in each class and I feel that if I am not doing my work continuously that I will fail. On top of that, I feel that although I am spending most all my time doing work I am still not understanding everything. I guess I wonder why people want to give us so much work. Now I just heard that on girl that I went to school with just died. What is going on with this world. I feel that more and more people are just dying. How are we suppose to concentrate on work when all this other stuff is going on. Now I am talking to a friend and she just told me about what happened. Anyway, I have lots of work to do and I have or I feel that I have no time to do my work. I wish I was back home resting instead of here having to work my hardest. Anyway, I hope that this year will get better for me so that way I won't be as unhappy. So I guess I should have a positive outlook on life. Wouldn't it be nice if everything went the way people wanted it too. No complications what so ever! I hope that God, family and friend will get me through all my tough times. I should me thankful for what I have because some people are not as fortunate. ",1
"Today is September 11th. I was reading some articles on MSN. com about whether or not we should commemorate this. I had a class at 9:30--I wish I didn't have to wake up for this class. It seems like whenever I have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy. I'm glad that the only other class I have is in the afternoon today. Speaking of which I'm going home for the weekend--that makes me happy because I will get away from everything related to UT Austin. My roommate was in the room, he just left. I am writing on my laptop--it's very hard to use this keyboard. I am tired right now. I don't know what to do. I have calculus homework to do. I feel like it has been looming over my head. I can't wait to go to home. I feel more comfortable here at UT now. I think I'm getting along with everyone. I don't feel stressed out anymore. I feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about. I will find what I like to do here. I might join the badminton club. That sounds like fun because I used to play badminton and now I don't anymore. I don't play it anymore because I don't feel like it. Being at UT is a lot of walking, I'm tired cause of it. I think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when I'm typing. I am Indian. My parents are from India. They are very nice people and they are at home. Sometimes I feel like they miss me and I miss them. I am going back to see them. I am getting tired of typing on the keyboard. I think I am a smart person. I wonder if other people think I try to act smart. I don't really care if they do. I'm just being myself. I get along with others. I don't think I will be completely satisfied in life thinking I have to be something when I grow up. I should just stay happy as I am right now. I think that would be a good life plan. Just take it easy. That's what I'm doing right now. My computer is a Dell and it's a laptop--with a small keyboard. I got it new. My roommate just came in. He is doing the laundry. I feel like he feels that he has a lot to do. It seems to me he likes to work. I am going to keep my life simple here at college. I won't expect myself to be a superhero. I think waking up for class is good because then the day doesn't go by. In college you have a lot of free-time. I think I spend too much time studying ineffectively. I should set good goals and then spend time making friends. I am very happy right now. I feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up. I have to get up to get the trash. Whenever I do work, I think of doing it in sequences. Sometimes I act smart. It's okay--I like to make intellectual jokes a lot. My parents used to take the trash from my room when I was young. They did a lot of things for me. Now I have to do a lot of things on my own. That's okay--we're almost out of milk. I'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so I can just throw them away after using it. I'm getting hungry. My roommate is eating Spaghetti from downstairs. That tastes good. Am I being artificial?  Am I talking as if I want people to hear what exactly I'm saying. I don't now. bye     ",1
"I just got finished with my Spanish homework and now I can think in English. I don't really care for Spanish very much other than its ability to help me understand another language. Before that I was writing email to friends of mine at other schools. It is a great comfort to be able to have communication with them. If I didn't have email I probably wouldn't be able to because making long distance phone calls is extremely expensive. I just found out that one of my friend's friend is quitting school. I don't understand that. Giving up an education seems ridiculous to me. Gold fishes are also ridiculous. My neighbor has oh wait, had two goldfish. One of them died last night. Gold fish are infamous for being fair-weather fish. One minute they are there and the next minute they are floating down the toilet bowl to a watery grave or a Pepsi commercial. I now have been writing for five minutes and I wish I could stop looking at the clock. I took a computer assisted English class last semester and I am not the least bit more comfortable working with a computer because of the experience. One of my projects last semester had to do with the Tick. He is a huge cartoon super hero dressed in blue spandex and often takes adventures, or nightmares, into the inner workings of his mind, he also has antenna which are referred to as those ""things"" on the cartoon by his cohorts. My little sister likes the tick as well but I don't think she understands alot the humor in it, most of its pretty stupid I will admit. My sister just learned how to say her ABCs in Spanish last week and wanted to repeat them to me over the phone. the way she says ""w"" is really cute. My brother just got married this past summer and I don't know what to think of his wife, she is cool and all but sometimes acts a little strange. but I am not really a judge of strange since I have been called that myself a time or two. Actually I think everyone is called strange, or weird, at one point or another because sooner or later each person takes a detour from what would be their own normal thing. Like my mom actually wanting me to buy an expensive gift for a friend, when she would normally suggest a nice greeting card, or package of candy. Ten minutes. It is amazing how often people look at the clock. My batteries went dead awhile back and I don't really miss it very much, granted I took my sister's Mickey mouse watch every now and then, in fact I think it is my room right now, but time often feels insistent and that can be stressful. Kind of like how I have time constraint on when and when not to write this assignment. My calf muscles are incredibly sore and I have been complaining about them all day. My roommate said that I shouldn't complain because I was the one who willingly went to an aerobics class yesterday. Well I was unaware that aerobics works out the calf muscles so much, if I had know that this was how I was going to feel the day afterward then it certainly would have made me think twice. 15 minutes. The MTV movie awards are on tonight and I don't know if I really want to watch them or not. Its just a bunch of funny people dressed in funny clothes prancing around telling everybody how cool they are, I get enough of that with going to school here, just kidding. I will probably watch it anyway. My neighbors are pretty cool, even the one with minus on fish. I sure hope it didn't die because she didn't feed it, or over fed it. I don't see the purpose of a goldfish, I like cats much better and will probably own the type of cat that will eat goldfish, even though that is disgusting. I just got a new kitten this past summer and her name was quesadilla, but now it is bob. What ever happened to quesadilla I will never know. I guess my dad and mom just couldn't hang with a name that made no sense. Well it made sense to me, because she was found two days old behind my brothers restaurant, and they have the best quesadillas there. 20 minutes. ",1
"IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY IN MAJOR TOURNAMENTS LIKE THE US OPEN, THE FRENCH OPEN, THE AUSTRILIA OPEN, ETC. EVEN IF JUST ONE TOURNAMENT, I WILL BE SO GREATFUL. AS I CONTAINUED WATCH THESE PROS PLAY, I PUSH MYSELF IN WORKING MY WAY UP THERE;I PRACTICE AS MUCH AS I CAN,I TRY TO LEARN AS MUCH AS I CAN, FROM THEIR MENTAL PART TO THEIR TECHNIQUES; ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT I WILL EVER  BECOME AS GOOD AS THEY ARE. YET, I NEVER GIVE UP MY DREAM OF ACTUALLY PLAYING IN ONE OF THE MAJOR TOURNAMENTS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT DREAMS DO COME TRUE IF I WORK HARD FOR IT. IF THIS DREAM NEVER COME TRUE I WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT MYSELF, AT LEAST THERE ARE GREAT MEMORIES LEFT IN ME. THERE ARE OTHER DREAMS AND MISSIONS I HAVE PLANNED TO WORK FOR, NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, AND I WILL ALWAYS BE POSITIVE IN EVERY DREAMS I HAVE AND IN WHATEVER I DO.  ",1
"My English teacher should go back to her own country. She read my essay today, and she couldn't understand a word on it. My topic is on samesex marriage, but she didn't even know that samesex marriages are illegal in the U. S. She read through the whole thing and asked me, ""So what is your point?"" At first, I thought it was just me, so I took it to the writing center. In a way, I just wanted to talk to someone. I had to complain about her to someone. Anyways, the guy in the writing center agreed with me. It's not my problem that she can't read. Well, I guess it is since she is the one who's going to grade my paper, but I am not going to put up with her. I am so going to change my teacher tomorrow. I am so glad that I still have the chance. I feel really relieved because my rough draft is done. I finally feel like I am getting somewhere with my paper. I am also very excited because the weekend is coming up. I am going to finish my homework in one day and enjoy the rest of my weekend. Maybe I will do my homework for the next week ahead of time so I will have more time during the week. I don't know. I seem to be addicted to homework lately. My dad said that I won't be happy if I move out. Well, I don't think that is true at all. I admit that college life is much harder than I have ever imagined, but living with him doesn't change that a bit. It's not like he could help me with my homework. He never did anyway. I feel so relieved after I moved out. It's great that I only have to deal with school. Dealing with my dad is much harder than anything else. I haven't really talked to my mom for a week now. I don't really know if I should call her. She is so worried about me. In a way, she is giving me a lot of stress. We are always talking about the same thing now. She keeps trying to convince me to move back. There is just no way that I am going do it. ",1
"I want to start with a simple color. Let's say blue. When I think of blue I think of the ocean and where I live. I live in Brownsville Texas. It's ""on the border by the sea""  That's like the Brownsville saying. I also think of baby blankets, actually my baby blanket. This leads me to thinking about a George Strait song entitled ""Baby Blue"". It's a song about his daughter that passed away in a car accident. He's describing her eyes and what he thinks about every day. That has to be hard to deal with. A death in the family is such a detrimental thing to cope with. Fortunately my family has never had an immediate family member pass away. The closest I've been to a loved one that has died, was my great-grandmother. I've also had my girlfriend lose her great-grandmother and her grandmother right after each other. I went to those funerals. I really don't like them very much, It's extremely sad for all the loved ones mourning the death. I guess this leads me to thinking about the color black. It's weird that people usually associate things or ideas to color. I guess it's because we're such a vivid creature. Our vision capabilities are quite advanced when compared to those of other animals. We, humans, are able to see most of the spectrum, all we cant see is the ultra-violet end and the, oh I forgot, I think it's the infer red side as well. We might excel in vision, but are still very primitive in the sense of smell. When we compare our smelling to that of canines, all I can say is that they are able to smell around 100-1000 times better than us. Back to black. Jet Black is favorite color, or at least it used to be. I really enjoy viewing the colors of nature. I have found myself buying shirts the colors of nature. Like a dirt/green or pale/orange, light/yellow or sky/blue, the color of soil. I love the smell of the earth after it rains, it smells so pure, rich, I guess I associate that smell to nature. Imagine what a dog smells after it rains. Now that's something I wish I could take a whiff of. That's around 25 min. of writing. I want to say that this has been a great experience for me. It calmed me down from this hurried morning. I feel more at ease with myself, but I can't explain why. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this little talk with me. I know I'm not supposed to use ""you"" when writing a paper, but the instructions say that it's alright to fib a little in my grammar. Sorry for any misunderstandings. ""Good-bye and Good-luck. "" ",1
"     Right now I am doing this psychology ut what will I be doing in the next couple seconds. Oop, my roommate just walked in and I have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time. Hard! My room mate said hi and I am having trouble responding to him, it looks like Stephanie is impressed with my bass. All right you all have a good one. Roommate has left, that is weird. I wonder what Misung shin  yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and Stephanie are going to do together, probably nothing much, I can hear my roommate, err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 2005 until the wee hours of the morning which doesn't really bother me but I think it might a little, who knows its probably just something to complain about. I want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with David but I don't have his number so maybe ill call mom and  dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me, I got to do the psychology experiment before Saturday I don't really understand the experiment system but I think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well I have been going on for a while now and I still have a ways to go, phooey. I like my psych teacher though, he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting. oh man I think I accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well I'll just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good, and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology I was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if I could ever be  a professor who really really knew his stuff. Do I work hard enough? I think I do, I been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but I've been working too. Another thing that I can't escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind, yet maybe I think about it more than others. I think about whether or not I'm too picky. I haven't ever gone with a girl for longer than like 2 months I really can't stand the thought of a girlfriend, I haven't really met a girl that I'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks I've already had some opportunities but I just straight decided I didn't' want to go with them why? you know it has to do with looks I probably seem really shallow but I just want a chick who looks DAMN good not just good if I find myself thinking of reasons why I don't like you the fact of the matter is I'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late I've ditched some really cool people and I feel bad about it but then I've been ditched too sometimes I think I have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you don't want to be somebody's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so I need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date, don't worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that's what I say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things don't just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people I think I will ask Kim and Liz if they want to go out sometime now there's two people that look like they got their shit together Liz dropped out of sfa last year so what? she has her priorities straight you know everybody has their faults I don't want to be recognized for getting a's in class that's crap I want people to say yeah that guys is a friggin funny cool guy I like being around him, but I only want people that I can get along with to say that how do you tell the ones that like you but you don't like them gto go away it seems harsh you don't want to be an ass and the fact of the matter is you may need them some day but for what??? as long as you've got your friends you are unstoppable you are having fun you are just with your buddies and you wouldn't have it any other way like my family man I just realized how much I love them by being away from them for such an extended period of time I really missed them I didn't think that would happen but it did my sister my dad my mom are really important to me and I love them to death bottom line man I'm hungry after this I'm going to see if I can get a hold of David and singer and maybe well go get something to eat I got to talk to David man that guy is really cool maybe I have the number in my desk somewhere I don't know but maybe ill just be lazy and go out by myself, maybe just maybe ill go out an meet somebody that will play an important role in my life maybe ill have one of the best times of my freshman year who knows what could happen in the 20 minutes after I finish this project who knows?  God knows? don't get me started I could write all the proofs that straight out blast Christianity to the nether regions but no I believe in that little piece of spirituality that's in us all call it God Jesus whatever its there but it is just there its our spirituality it is us so thanks for reading and ill talk to you later boi.

"Last night I had another fight with my mother. Maybe it was not such a good idea to stay home for my first year of college. As far as I can see I have only brought her pain and no comfort. Although she does make several good points about my  unorthodox behavior, ultimately I am a grown man. If I told my friends that she tries to make me come home at a certain time  the result would be ridiculous. Not that opinions and thought of my buddies would really sway my mind, but many of them respect me for where I came from and what I have done. I've got a good job(insurance company $7. 80/hour), pay for my car, attend college,  help my mom at her beauty salon, and still have time to go out and party with them. My mother thinks that my constant ventures  to places she has never been will bring about my demise. Certainly there is no way I can deny about her role in my life. She has always been there for me and lately we have grown even closer, but I dont see how she can try and write my schedule out for me  according to her opinions. Recently our dog had 7 puppies and she spent much of the time caring for them and taking them to the vet. Six of the puppies have been sold, and the one that is left originally belonged to the mail dog's owner who changed their mind about  keeping it. so my mom blames me for not cleaning up after the puppy I dont even want. I tell her to give it away and then she  blames for being a cruel person in that we dont know what kind of person would get it. For a while now I have been looking for a female. And I dont mean just any ol' girl I can get plenty of those. But a lady who I won't get tired of after the first night in bed. There is  several ladies out there who I would like to be with, but for some reason it never turns out to be the way I thought. So I just go on  with flirting' around. Most girls I know think that I except something from them, but I'm simply trying to be friends. I guess thats  the rep I got at Anderson high. Maybe because of the people I hang with. Hopefully I've written enough, and if not here are some more  of my thoughts for the prof to analyze. In college I've tried to have different study habits then high school. In high school I could do  nearly nothing and still maintain a high average. Here I know this can not be done. this of course another concern of my mother. I can not dismiss actual reading and studying as not important at the university of Texas or I might end up with a poor man working for McDonaldss or begging for money on the drag. A few days ago I read (in the psychology book) that in order for your mind  to expand you must exercise it like a muscle. Interesting idea.              ",1
I don't really know what I should write about. I guess I'm feeling alright. My class was cancelled for today so I had the whole day off. I rented Sling Blade which I liked the movie had people with psychological problems like the guy who is always talking about women he killed and the main character who cuts peoples heads open every once in a while if he feel s it is necessary. The keyboard on the computer sucks since the space bar key keeps on sticking whenever I try to push it down. I am kind of nervous about classes because last semester I screwed up grade wise after keeping an almost 4. 0 GPA for 2 and 1/2 semesters. I have never taken psychology before in high school and I wish I had since it would make the class easier now when I take it. I really can't type continuously for twenty minutes without having a definite subject so I keep having to stop and think of something to type. One of my goals this semester is to stop watching TV so often because that is what I feel screwed me up last semester since I was always staring at the screen either their or while surfing the web. Now I beginning to feel a little grossed out because I was just thinking about our dorm meeting where they told us housekeeping comes in only every other day to clean the bathroom when they used to come every day and it was still pretty dirty now it is going to be even worse. I guess it has been about twenty minutes now I forgot what time I started typing at since I forgot to write it down I thought I would have remembered. So I'm just going to call it a night. ,1
"I believe sometimes I think to much about what's at hand. I always have to be scheduled and know what's to come. I wonder if its just good discipline or if its a problem. For example its the first day of class and I'm doing the writing assignments already, it was my mind so I did it. My mind is wandering, I'm thinking about my girlfriend at home and what she is doing and thinking about, hopefully me of course. What are my other friends doing that went to others schools, do they feel pressured. What am I suppose to be thinking or typing about. I wonder if your looking for any certain topic we should be thinking about. Am I going to do well in this class, will I get an A, B , C, D, or even fail? I guess I will find Out Eventually. ",1
"     I am a little worried about this asignment because I don't type very fast, but I guess this is giving me good practice. I don't know if i should go run before dinner or take the excerisese class that is after dinner. I need to do something because I will get into the pattern of not working out,and then i will gain the freshman 15 like very one says you do. There is just so many other things that i need to be doing. But i know that i feel better if i work out. If i gain weight i will get depresed and i won't want to do anything. I can't believe Jason is so wraped up in working out. i am supposed to be the one worried about my figure. Ana has lost weigh too. How does she stay so motivated, and excited about runing. I would go take that class, but i have never done kick boxing, and i will problay look very stuiped. There are girls that just never shut up in this dorm. And some that always have the perfect hair and make up. That just seems so high school to me. I am excited about the chrisitan soriety. I hope i can find some girls that i like to hang around with. Surley their will be a couple that i will enjoy being around. I hope I enjoy the pledge retreat on Friday. I bet we will be up all night. That means that I will probably be sick again. Ana is coming down on Saterday, and I hope that Amy will come to. Amy has grown up so much in the last couple of months. I can't believe that she is being exposed to all of the Jenkins trama with Jims affairs. That is just a burden that she should not have to have. I know i think about it all the time and i did not have to listen to it as much as she did. It just amazes me how he could have done that. I wonder if he has some kind of mental problem. It would not surprise me, look at his dad. I just hope Graham is not like his dad. Surley Ana would know if he was. At least i hope she would know, for her sake. I think it is funny how Pam all the sudden likes to cook now. She is in her late fortys and is just now learning how to cook. Thats sad. I am glad that i grew up in a family who cooks, and eats dinner together at night. Or at least we did when we  were little. Not all the time now that everyones off to college. It was so wird going home this weekend, it was almost like i had to get used to it again. It has felt so far away for the past three weeks. I don't want to go home too much. I want mom and dad to get the feeling that Im gone, and so then when i come home it is special. Jason made me mad this weedend, becuause he did not come and visit with my parents. I took time out of my schedule to come and visit his parents. His parents seemed weird this weekend also, i wonder what was up. Page seemed like she was jelouse that they were having to buy Jason some new cloths. That is so rediculous. She is a grown woman that can act like a small child some times. She can be very stingy. I can't believe that Jasons parents don't support him very much, i guess i am just used to having the best dad in the world  ",1
"Every class seems like it has so much extra work, I feel like I  will never have any free time. Other than the work though, I love college compared to high school. I love the freedom I have and even the new responsibilities. Right now everything is still fun, I'm sure though that I will get sick of cooking, cleaning,ironing, and doing everything else by myself pretty soon. I already miss my parents a little and my little sister very much. I can't wait to see her. I feel really bad though, because I promised her that I would come home and see her in two weeks, but I don't think I am going to be able to see her for another week. My mom said she was so excited that I was coming home. She just started second grade and I wish I could have been there to see her. It really sucks that I have to leave her, I feel like we may not be as close anymore if I don't see her as much. She used to beg me every night to sleep in my bed with me and at the time it was kind of a pain, but I really miss it now. I also really miss my boyfriend who is also back in Dallas. He came down last weekend, but I don't think I'll get to see him for another week either. He is really taking me going off to college really good. I figured he would be mad at me all the time for hanging out with other guys and stuff, but he has been really cool about it. At first he got really jealous, but we talked about it and now he is completly understanding. I really hope we make it through the year and mabey he can move down here next year!  That would be perfect. Ilive with my best friend so at least I have her here. I think it would be really hard to go to such a big place like UT and not know anybody. people do it all the time ,but I think  that I would get really depressed if now one I knew and trusted was down here. I really love it down here. Austin is a really awesome town, it has everything!  It is really different from Midlothian, which is where I come from. It is a small town 30 miles south of Dallas. We only have about two stop lights and mabey three fast food places. I think its really great though that I am getting the chance to live in a really small town and a reall big town too. ",1
"When asked to write about my subconcious it just blocked everything that was in my mind. Let me see. well today I went to this Sigma Phi Omega Rush event and that has been in my mind ever since. Everyone there was so nice, everyone was smiling and introducing themselves and it makes me wonder is that how they really are? Or are they just doing that to get us to like their organization so they can take our money? Maybe I'm being paranoid, but those people were just really very very friendly that it felt like some horror flick full og nice smiling faces and they wait for the right moment to attack. During this event they had us fill out a questionare kind of like an application. One of the question was ""What quality do you have to contribute to the organization?""  The thing was I couldn't think of anything to say. I mean I am not a talented singer or anything or a pianist. I am just me. Isn't that enough? Then later on they interviewes us and they taped us! How embarrasing! They asked questions that will catch you by surprise! Like ""What song best describes you?"" I was like ummmmmmmmmmm OH OH the first thing that popped in my mind was Butterfly by Mariah Carey. I just made up some bogus answer that it symbolizes freedom and independency. honestly though I had no idea at the time what Butterfly was about or was talking about. I wonder if they know!? Oh well. I've been debating with my friends if I should join or not because it seems like a great experience meeting new people and all. The only thing that I am worried about is will they accept me for who I am or do I have to be the typical sorority chic? and I forgot to mention. Pledging is the big secret it is supposed to last 8 weeks! and no one can mention what exactly goes on during this 8 weeks!  DO we have to clean toilets or what? Maybe that is why they keep it a secret because once all the Rushees know about it they will think again before they join. Makes me wonder what pledging is all about. A lot of people think that joining a sorority is a good idea especially for social reasons. I would describe myself as friendly and sometimes outgoing, but I can be pretty shy with strangers. is that weird? It's just that some people I meet is just that I have no idea what to talk about, it is as if I freeze and don't know what to say. It is also kind of embarrasing because you look like a total fool if you don't know what to say or do especially with someone who doesn't know you very well. I think the reason why I sometimes feel that way, is that I feel intimidated and I feel really awkward. Like I do right now because I feel like I am runing out of things to say. Actually to think about it sororities do take up much time. Just to go to Rush events I have spent approximately 8 hours already and I haven't even been in it yet. It was for two organizations. Tomorrow is the party and I am not really looking forward to it because deep down inside I want to stay in my dorm and study instead of going to the Club. Lately I have been lazy and haven't been doing much but I promise myself that I will study and get the grades my parents deserve to see after all they've done for me. And if they ever find out I went to these meetings instead of study they won't be so proud. But I think one of the reasons that parents don't understand these tings, is because all they want me to do is study. I guess going and Rushing for these sororities is kind of my way to rebel. I know it sounds weird, but that is how I feel. ",1
While sitting on my computer many thougts and feelings come into my head. I have now been at school for alsmost 3 weeks and I can't believe it. School is finally becoming a reality. It has just started to feel like home. I am from out of state and when I came to school I felt like I was at sleep a way camp trying to meet my friends for the next month. It is true I am not at camp anymore. It has been hard for me lately because I miss home. I miss my family and friends. It seemed to me at the beginning of school that everyone new each and I was the outcast. It has been hard finding friends even though everyone is very nice. It is different here because my closest friends aren't here with me. I came from a very close group of friends and we each went different directions. I am ready to meet new people but I want them to be like my best friends at home and that is not gooing to happen. I have to understand that I will become close to the people here at school I just have to give it time. I also miss my family tremendusly. I am very close to my family and try to talk to them at least once a day but talking is not the same a seeing them. It is very wierd not seeing my sister. We are 3 years apart but we are extremly close. Every time I talk to her I get a tear in my eye. The thought of not seeing her for another month makes me very upset. She told me the other day that she felt like I was on a trip and coming home. She tells me all the time how much she misses me and that makes the situation worse. I can't wait to see her and my parents. I have a very unique realationship with my parents. They are also like my best friends. I feel I can tell them anything. The are my inspiratin and my confindence in one. I have had a lot on my ming latly about school I am very nervous about all the work and tests. I feel as though it is going to be a lot harder that high school. It has been very hard to get back into the school mode but I am starting to get back in to it. I have had a lot of distractions latly with the sorority and and tring to meet eveyone to make friends but I realize I have to start putting school in front of all that. I am here for school and I need to start putting effort in to it. I am very dilgent and like to get my work done but I don't want to stress myself out. Even though school is very important I still need to have fun. I need to balence myself. I feel that it might take some time to get adjusted but it will all work out. School has definately been tough but it has resently gotten better and I know it will get better each day I am here. I am so glad that I made the decision to come to UT and experience this great school.       ,1
"Ok I've put this off long enough and you say that 25% of the class has already completed this assignment so I think its time for me to too. 20 minutes. jeez that seems like a really long time now that Im sitting here and just RAMBLING on and on and on and on. . this is all typing on one line. do I have to hit return to send it to the next line?? I think Im gonna try it and see what happens. Whoa. that was WAY cool man. like totally. so cool. I'm gonna have to do it again!!! Well Im bored right now. 1 minute elapsed.

No doubt ROCKS!!!  Don't speak. I know what your saying. so please stop explaining. don't tell me cause it hurts. that song is so good~~I used to love it before they started playing it on the radio 24-7.

It always seem like I misspell no one. because that would be pronounced NOON would it not?? if I said NO  space ONE. then that would sound ok but it looks SOO weird!!! AHHHH!!!  I am  slowly going crazy 1 2 3 4 5 6 switch. slowly am I going crazy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 switch. you know what?? this is a really really cool assignment!! I think it'd be cool if I could jut talk to someone like this totally going off on tangents whenever I want to. speaking of tangents. i hate precalculus!!!  I dont think I should take calculus in college cause my roommate( who I will get to later) says its really  hard and he's quite the WIZ at math. Ill take it at community college maybe,. yeah yeah yeah. ogh my roommate kareem. hes a friend of mine from Houston. its like we've been together 24-7 since we moved in together and its really kinda annoying. i feel bad cause he was like one of my best friends and now its like I dont wanna be around him anymore!!. so Ill tell you what I want what I really really want. if you want my future forget my past. if you wanna get with me. better make it fast. SPICE girls SUCK!!! Im listening to a new CD right now that I got at the radio station at UT---91. 7 KVRX. I'm applying for a position there as a DJ or something. that should be thrilling.

I LOVE YOU!!! whoever reads this!!!  knowledge is power. and teachers go around giving it away for free~~how sweet!!! well actually I believe there were some fees included in this class. and its not like the teachers arent compensated in some sort so Somebodys paying for them to  give away the knowledge. SO anyway. its been real. I'm actually sad to go. I've become so attached. talk to you later!!! love y a more!!! ~~~~~~joshua ",1
"It is quiet in my room, Josh is asleep and all I hear is the fountain that I bought at Sam's gurgling and trickling in the background I wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a/c units it is a pretty neat school though, I can't wait until I see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, I don't think I talk that much on the phone, I think it's more like ahh I really don't know, but it's not that much when I type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and I almost forget that it's there, and then when I stop it comes back again, I guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 8 minutes and I feel like I've been typing for a really long time, I wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure I think I need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar I hope I win the lottery so I can buy the computer and the guitar, I think I can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, I never thought I would actually be subsisting on 6 hours of sleep and  those damn Ramen noodle cups that I'm sure are poisoning me even as I speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as Jester food I think there was some human in that burger I just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but I just can't figure out what it is maybe I should order Chinese food and hope fully there won't be real Chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too I really don't like people who eat people but I dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, I like the Discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill I wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, I think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can I think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of Texas but at least we recycle them back home I get money for doing it but here I just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke I wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, I always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but I would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something I think if I had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and I could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now I really wand a tiger, but I would settle for some neons in my fish tank, I wonder where they are sold. . . .

"     Ok, here I go. I wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this. Probably all kinds of things. Well, I have a girlfriend, her name is Lauren, and today is our 10 month aniversary. I'm excited but I'm sad that I don't get to see her that much because she is still in high school. She goes to Clark in San Antonio just like I did. That's where we met. We were both on the cross country team. I'm kind of tired. I wish I didn't have to spend all my time reading the Iliad. It's getting really boring and I don't even think it's a very good book. They just like it because it's old. Like last night I spent several hours reading it and I still had to do more before I went to class today. Man, it's only been 5 minutes, I don't think I can actually think for a whole 20. I wonder what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this right now. Probably doing calculus homework or reading, heaven-for-bid, the Iliad. I can't wait until the weekend when I can relax some more. At least I only have one class tomorrow and it's really easy. It's calculus and this is my third year in a row of taking it for I shouldn't have any trouble with it. Unfortunately though it's all stuff I've already learned so it's boring also. Let's see, that makes two boring classes now. How about ancient Rome and BA101, those are also boring classes, but at least I like Rome so at times that class can be interesting. So that leaves psychology, that's definitely the best class I'm taking, because it's really interesting. Especially because many of the things don't have answers so it's just what you think. I'm probably biased towards it though, because I've always been a math and science fan. Math was ruined by one teacher I had, but I still love science. Hopefully, I can use the business skills I learn to start or work for something like a bioengineering company, that would be cool. Psychology is also fun because I know a few people in there. One of the guys in there I went to pre-school and kindergarten with and haven't really seen him since. Monday I met this girl named Jessica. She's pretty nice so I have someone to talk to before class. Bjorn just got home, I wonder where he's been. He probably was at class, I wonder which one. He really likes Cake and he just turned them on. I can tell when he's in his room usually because there is music on. He also likes the Beatles. I don't really like the Beatles but Cake is cool. I wonder who just got on AIM. I guess it was Rory because he just IMed me. I wonder what he wants. Maybe I'll have to tell him to go away, but I probably won't, because I'm not that kind of person. I don't like putting people down or causing conflict. I guess that's just who I am. I am, I think that's the best quote I've ever heard. It can be interpreted in so many ways and it's the only think that we know is absolutely true. ",1
"so , i am supposed to write what i think. thats sorat hard, because everytime you think a thought, it has disappeared by the time you have finished wirrint it. but at the moment i would like to talk about the one thing that is on lmy mind: my mother  yes, she is my mother, and yes, she is extremely overprotective. but i am in COLLEGE now . that is a wee different than high school in the sense that you have ot be. o whats the word. . independent   will do. yea you have to think for yourself, stand up for yourself, be yoursefl. except if your mother is preventing you from doing that, what are you supposed to do? if she doesnt let you come home later than whatever time she setss (which by the way is not very late at all) then you are basically in 9th grade again. do this, do that. and the worst part is, she never directly states what is on her mind. she starts out by asking questions. where were you all this time? i was worrying? why didnt you tell me?  i did ma. i don't remember  well thats too bad . i have to go tomorrow as well  where? when? till what time?  who what where when why and how, she might as well be a journalist. she instilled morals and values on me. doesnt she trust her own upbringing?  doesnt she trust me?  trust is anothe issue and overprotectiveness is another. or at least i think she is being overprotective. maybe to her indian standards she is extremely liberal. maybe. but this isnt india! this is the us, land of freedom. not that i'm going to go off and elope with some pierced stranger. i just want some privacy, some freedom. and most of all i want to move out. that in itself would solve so many problems. first of all, i wouldnt have to listen to her critisizing me one moment and loving methe next. she also would be liberated from my constant bickering and un called for interruptions. i wouldnt be too far away and yet not close enough to be distracted. everytime i try to study, she comes in every 15 to 20 mts. unless of course if she is taking a   nap   of 3 hours or so. but i feel guilty. i feel guilty for the way i am thinking. she deserves that nap, every second of it. if i worked as hard as she does, i would be half unconscious by now. but she finds time for a full time job, for being a single mother, for paying bills, for making food, for everything you would want a mother to do, as well as everything you wish she wouldnt do. she is the epitome of motherhood, in all its glory and grime. she has her pro's and cons, and i love her for that. but sometimes she can be a real pain.  enought about her, i still have 12 minutes of writing left. what can i write about. lets see, college. yes college is most definitely on my mind at the moment, because i am doing a college assignment. i also have a bunch of homework to do after this and it is already 10 pm. i am not too good at doing all nighters. the latest i have slept is 5 am. and that was not study related. that was lets have a girl cousin talk thing.  but that aside, college seems to be hard, but not as hard as i had thought it to be. i am not completely clueless as to what is beingsaid in my classes, but at the same time, i am quite amazed at the amount of reading that has to be done. its not the reading actually, its the note taking that is required in intense detail and that takes up a whole lot of time. i am trying to think of what to think and it isnt working too well, so i'll just write about my family. well theres my brother and i could go on and on about him. personally i think he's a spoiled brat. he has as much potential as his fourteen yr old cerebrum can handle, but that potential is over ridden by his spoiled bratedness. he is plain spoiled , by my mother mostly. when i was his age ( now why does that sound so familiar. . i am not that old, am i?) i was super disciplined by my father; the beatings, the cruel and unusual punishments, the whole package. yes, so i think i am definitely more responsible. whereas my younger sibling, he has the disadvantage of being not only a spoiled brat, but an extremely lazy spoiled brat. he reads a lot, and thats pretty much the only good thing about him. another controversial curse in the form of a blessing is that he can phase out the rebukes of my mother. now one minute ago i was critisizing him and now i'm commending him, but not really. it only seems to be a boon at certain times, like if i really did not want to hear my mother tell me how all the other girls my age are doing jobs and iam sitting around and my legs are gettin fat andn how i should exercise more. because she has already said it 10 times that week and wishes to say it once more, as if i couldnt hear her say it 10 times, whereas i actually could. that didnt sound like it made sense. but yea. this stream of consciousness thing, i did it in senior yr ap english. my teacher, mrs. lydic was one . . uh. . unique lady. she was somewhat crazy in the sense that she drank unbelievely outrageous amounts of coffee and had this almost supernatural smirk/ smile on her face. and her hair was always the exact same way. side parting with a big dome of hair on the top. yes i sound so shallow in this  callow description of her physical faults, but it was that mingled with her personality that made the ap english experience not really unpleasant, but unusual. so after i discovered that i had to do a stream of consciousness paper in psychology i thought, i can never get rid of lydic. she will always be there. not that thats a bad thing. i suppose it is thanks to her ( and my own diligent efforts) that i got a 4 on the english literature advanced placement exam. but now i have less than 30 secons left and i would just like to say, this soc paper didnt really provide a catharsis for me.

"Right now it is 11:25. I am sitting by myself in the dorm at Hardin House. It is raining very hard outside. Earlier I went to Target and bought a Brita water purifier and they forgot to put it in the sack, so I got home and then had to drive all the way back. I am from Tulsa, Oklahoma and it is honestly a little weird being from out of state. I love UT however so don't get me wrong, but it is very strange not knowing hardly anyone when I go out at night. I went through rush at the beginning of school and pledged Theta. I am having so much fun and I love all of the girls in my sorority. My friends and I have been going to all of the fraternity pledge lines to meet the new members. When I walk in the room I don't know a soul there and also notice that there is a ten to one girl to guy ratio. Also since living in Austin I have been trying to familiarize myself with the area. I have actually not gotten lost or been late to any of my classes so far so that is comforting. I have also been exploring the city and going to numerous fun restaurants, for example Hula Hut, Shady Grove, Dirty's and much more. As I walk down the drag I notice that there is a large variety of people in Austin. Yesterday I had my first encounter with the infamous Leslie who wears a tutu on sixth street. Apparently a few years ago he ran for a government office and came frightening close to the winner. Also today when I went to Einstein bagels I looked at the guy sitting across from me and he definitely had boobs. College in Austin is much different than my small private high school in Tulsa. I never knew how sheltered we all were and I am so glad that I have been exposed to more diversity and gotten a glimpse at the real"" world. Right now my roommate is trying to get ready and keeps tapping on her desk. It is funny how something so small can distract you so much when you are trying to focus. I live with 250 girls needless to say it has been a little difficult finding a good study place. Although there are many distractions at Hardin House, I am so glad this is where I live. I have already met so many nice people and have made a ton of new friends. Everyone always asks my if it is weird going to school with 50,000 plus people. Sometimes it is, like when I walked into my psychology class and say 500 other people sitting down in a huge auditorium. But then sometimes it doesn't seem big at all. I have already found a group of people I ""hang out"" with everyday and I almost always see a familiar face on the way to class. I am so excited for the Arkansas game this weekend. Football is my favorite sport and I really hope the Longhorns can beat OU this year since that is where all of my friends go to school. On Tuesday I joined a group call TAG, Texas Advertising Group, because I am trying to transfer in to the Communications College. I am a little nervous about that because I heard it was very difficult. I am currently in the Liberal Arts school as an English major. My classes seem to be going very well. I think after this paper I am going to have to watch a movie or maybe the Sex and the City DVD with my friends because they are all avid watchers while I have never seen a single episode. I never really get hooked on a TV series. I always just watch the show when it comes out on video. ",1
"     my mom is so silly or mabey it is th eway I say them she just gets things wrong. But I love her and dad and sister they just anoy me. She tells me too much info and I get kind of too rude.

"This is my first year at UT and I am not used to doing everything on my own. I am scared that I am not strong enough to make it. I am trying hardest though, I do not want to disappoint my parents. I feel like there is so much to get done and I will not to be able to finish everything on time. I am also worried because I do not understand a lot of what is being taught in my classes. This is extremely frustrating because I took these classes in high school and I did well in all of them. I am confident that I will be able to pull through all of this, and hopefully I will be a stronger person for it. I do like this new environment, however. Austin is a beautiful city. I love being here, and being on my own. I feel like I am discovering so much, and it is great!  I think I have all these different feelings because I am in a new place, with totally different surroundings, and most of all I am on my own. There is no one to depend on but myself. I already see how I am changing and growing. Even though everything seems so overwhelming, I love the experience!     ",1
"At my high school I graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy ""college life"". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to Taco Bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. ",1
"It all of a sudden becomes hard to think when you are instructed to. haha. I am so overwhelmed with everything I have to do this weekend. I have so much reading to catch up on in all my classes and I am going to have to do it this weekend or I will never get caught up. I hate biology, I'm so lost, maybe I should drop it before it's too late. But that would be kind of dumb. I don't know how I'm going to pass the first test. I wonder if anyone else is as lost as I am. At least I'll be done with this pretty soon and I will have one less thing to think about. Maybe I can get Houston to drive on the way home for Ashton's birthday. I really don't feel like driving all the way back but I guess I have no choice. Wow, I really need to get her something. maybe a she would like a shirt from the co-op. My phone is ringing but it is across the room and I guess since I am being timed it wouldn't be smart to answer it. I wonder who it is. hope it's not too important. I guess I'll just call the number back when I am done with this. I'm really hungry, maybe when I finish this I'll go eat at the cafeteria. Hopefully they will have something good because Jester City Limits is too expensive and not that great either. I doubt they will though, a peanut butter sandwich doesn't sound that bad. My room is so quiet right now, I wish Erin would get back so we could go eat. I hate the annoying sound of fans which is the only sound I hear, but our room is too hot without it. I doubt they will ever fix the air conditioner. I really need to order some concert tickets online before it is too late. Taking Back Sunday and Saves the Day, Panic, and so many more I wish I could get but I'm poor. I guess I'll only go to two nights of Panic too. I wish I was in a band, then I wouldn't have to be in biology. Yay!  Erin's back and the T. V. is on. I would rather be listening to music but I figured I should do this in silence because if I was listening to music I would just sing in my head the whole time. I can't stand dumb commercials or long ones. Erin just reminded me I have to fill out that application. one more thing out of a million. I really need to get on top of things. Too bad I'm not more creative or that application would be easier. Hmmm only a few more minutes to think. I'm tired too bad I have too much to do or I would take a nap. A shower would be nice as well. I also need to go check my mail. I guess I'll do that when we got eat or something. 5,4,3,2,1. finish!   ",1
"It's been almost a week since I have moved to Austin to study. There have been times when I miss home, as well as times when I call my dorm room home. I don't understand why exactly I am here. None of this makes any sense. I've grown up, studying at a small school, small church, small community type settings, and I've thrown myself into the largest university in the nation, surrounded by many diverse students of all kinds. My friends have made the transition easier, as well as comforting. However, there's still a little void inside of me. Where did it come from though? I see that naturally, God has some sort of plan for me here. But as of now, I have not a clue. No reason, no rhyme. And here I am writing my psychology assignment on the day it was assigned. This never happens. I am the one who's lazy and always procrastinates to the last possible second before even lifting a finger towards any assignment handed my way. Yet, I feel like a change is about to occur. A transformation possibly, from a cocoon to a butterfly so to say. Leaving behind the old, and embracing the new as it comes my way. I look around my desk, seeing my personal belongs as it reflects my own personality, my soul, my spirit. And I realize, that I'm lacking. I have my mere clothing, and books for my classes, my computer. The only thing that resembles anything about myself is my Jars of Clay poster, given to me by a friend. This poster is the only tangible object, image to represent myself. Do I lack a soul, or have I yet to express it in a more productive manner? Why am I even writing about this anyway? Why did I begin writing this so early? Regardless of it all, I know that He has a plan for my life. Everything I do has a purpose for the sake of His glory. Whether people acknowledge His existence or not, He is still there and is all powerful. Two plus two is four, never five. God is here, and always will. People can choose to ignore Him, but His existence still remains. I miss my Youth Pastor, Gary, who taught me to seek God with everything I have. He was the kind of man who'd parents would approve of as a personal mentor. His wisdom and knowledge of every concept in the world baffles me, and kept me curios. But it's his compassion that I miss the most. The tears he shed, when he heard of a young boy committing suicide because his peers perpetual teasing. The affectionate, unconditional love he expresses towards his wife and children. These things, I miss the most. But the one true divine aspect about Gary, is that he's a man of God. A man who sought after God without ever holding back. He dove in. Not caring where or how, when or why, he dove in. Will mankind ever see a man like him again? I look at the clock, and my twenty minutes is almost over, only a minute left for my required writing time. Did I do the correct assignment? Did I do this the way my professor wanted me to? Oh well. Blah. ",1
"sitting here just writing stuff down on paper. thinking about going out tonight. Im pretty happy because the navy paid me some more money. so there is money to go out with. Im doing this on paper hoping it's a little easier than just typing. time goes slow when you are waiting on it. that girl is really cute. I can not concentrate on one thing for that long of a time. there are people here talking which takes my attention. the football game tomorrow. Im not going. every body seems to be gung-ho about going. I don't see the big deal. watch it on tv who is lance corporal ruther. being late for pt would suck because they make you write about that stuff. thoughts are a weird thing everything you look at will bring on a thought the books, people everything they talk about will make you think a certain thing and it's not like you can ignore them when there in the same room. there's too much time for me to make up today. I can't do it. I wonder what they'll do. probably not much Ill have about three quarters of I so it shouldn't be a big deal. it's good that we have it but it should be open alot later than just 9 o'clock. extra study. the ROTC unit is good that way I guess I wonder how late I have to stay there today. it doesn't really matter I guess but I want to go out tonight this is my one night to go out and get drunk so I plan on doing it not real bad but some. people are trying to figure out there total hours. I need to but I doubt it'll help it's funny how people use there study hours. mostly trying to figure out little things to do. everything but study. I think that's time I hope this is close to what the assignment was. my mind is pretty simple so it's hard to write for that long about what it's doing. ",1
"I am sad. I just started thinking about the dog I left behind in Katy, Texas. That isn't exactly why I am sad though. It seems weird to me that I am really missing my dog and hardly ever thinking about my mom and dad. It isn't that I don't love my mom or dad but something must have gone wrong considering this is my first time away from them and I am hardly talking to them at all. If my mom sends me an email is usually says something like: nothing new here, Mickey's now. Mickey is my dog. I really feel like my dog is more important to my mom then I am. At least she has always spent more time with him. I am getting teary eyed which is weird because I haven't cried in years and I don't think I have anything to cry about now. My roommate's mom calls him every single night. I have talked to her more then I have talked to my mom since I have been here. I haven't heard a word from my dad at all. Oddly enough I don't really miss my friends back home. We have been very close since sixth grade and I just left them. For some odd reason this really doesn't bother me. I can't stop thinking about how much your class stresses me out. It seems so easy. I know it won't be easy though, and that makes we question how much time I should be spending on it now. I almost had a panic attack when I saw that the website was down but it is now back up and that makes me feel okay. I am really hungry which is weird because I just ate a piece of ham, a piece of turkey, sweet potatoes, a piece of pecan pie, broccoli and cheese, and a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich. Isn't that nuts. Hopkins 24/7 is now on. That is an awesome show. It really hits hard without showing gruesome ER scenes (it is a documentary series). I lost my train of thought and I am now writing about nothing. Well, my twenty minutes are up. Bye. ",1
"I just wasted over an hour and a half trying to get my stupid Ethernet card to work. the worst part is that I waited over four weeks for this stupid thing to come in and now none of the drivers and software recognize it. I think it is  royally <blank>. now I have to waste another two hours talking to technical  support so they can take the thing back. what a rip. this makes this day a  really big let down, considering I complained to my parents about getting this  thing up here for me. I could have been doing some of the hundreds of hours of  homework that I have to do. this day has been really wasted. every day is a  waste. all I do is homework each day and nothing more or less. occasionally I get to watch half an hour of television or go to the union or go play a few  video games, but lately, it seems that every class wants me to spend a few hours each night working on their assignments. I haven't even had time to look around the Austin area. I haven't seen a movie in a while either. this place  really sucks. I don't do anything really interesting. I have no life. now Im complaining too much AND being self-conscious. I couldn't even read my notes on that example. he talks too fast for people to keep up. psychology sounds pretty cool. the breeze never hits Austin. it's like it is always hot and the sun never goes away. maybe one day it will turn into fall in this town and finally it's  be relatively cool so I don't marinate in my own juices. yeah, I know it sounds gross, but what would you call it? I take a shower, walk to Kinsolving, when I  get there, Im tired and need to take a shower, and I sure do work up an appetite. it's the way back that is a killer. by the time you get back to Moore hill, you feel like rolling over and dying because of your full stomach, the  supersaturated shirt and the fatigued feet. I need to jog more. it seems like  Ill never have time. I never have time to do any of my old hobbies. for crying out loud, I can't even get y network card to install onto my notebook. I wish I had time to do my old hobbies, like photography. I could have and should have majored in photography. maybe I should major is psychology. it's a really  interesting class and I kind of like it I wish they served more than three flavors of ice-cream. it's like that chicken. 'today for dinner, roasted chicken. for lunch it'll be chicken dumplings, tomorrow it'll be chicken soup. then  creamy chicken blank. tomorrow it is chicken patties, the next day it is chicken nuggets, the next day they'll run out of chicken and serve chicken fried steak with chicken gravy for the steak and mashed potatoes' it's repulsive what they serve us. maybe I should reduce my meal plan. better check in the morning. I  still have another few minutes. my roommate is asking about cyanide. I guess  thats what happens when your girlfriend dumps you. tough break. he's been really depressed. he's been like this all evening. I wonder what Ill do tomorrow. I better get a plan together for what needs to be done. hmmm. I wish I could  get my net access. now Im pissed. ",1
"College isn't at all what I thought it was going to be. MAN, that French class is really kicking my but right now!!  But, I'm determined to suck it up and get through it with a decent grade!!  I feel so insignificant compared to John, he probably has no idea what it feels like to feel so behind everyone else!  But of coarse, I would never let on to that around him. I really can't wait till I finish this semester and maybe next semester I will have a better experience. I really think that 17 hrs for a freshman is a little too much, especially for me. I really feel like I cheated someone out of a spot well earned here at UT. I don't feel like I'm smart enough to be here. But I'm sure that I'm not the only person that had those thoughts every now and then. I really just hope I can keep a b avg so I can keep that scholarship!!!  I should probably make French a pass/fail class. I'm just so jealous of people that catch on to language so quickly and leave students like me in the dust!!  Ah. I should just be glad that I have the opportunity to explore myself here instead of griping about it 24/7. And MOM!!!  she can't keep her mouth shut. If I wanted John to know I wasn't feeling very confident then I would have told him!!!!  But of coarse, he calls and says, ""mom said you couldn't handle your FR class. Well, just remember that school is your job!""  I know JOHN!!!!!!!!!!!  he just doesn't understand that I have too much pride in me to admit that, yeah, I was crying to mom that I really didn't know if I could keep up in French!  I hate it when he sees that ""failing"" side of me. I want to be as invincible as he is. And that's impossible. I can't live up to his example!!  There's no way I'll graduate first in my class here at UT like he did and get some awesome job in new York that pays more money than I've ever seen at once!!!  It sux having a brother that had scholarships that paid all of his college expenses with money still left over!!!!!  He amazes me. Maybe that's my problem is I'm trying too hard and wasting all my energy to impress him!  Its not Mom, I know she just wants these years to be the best years of my life, but john wants them to be my JOB!!!!!!  What the hell!!!!  Can I not have a normal family that just is happy and supportive of me and understands that I am an individual that will do and accomplish different things than they ever did in different ways than they ever thought of!!!  Maybe UT's not for me. Maybe I'm meant to be at some rinkydink community college, where not that much is expected of me!!  But no. That's not me. There's just something in me that won't let me settle on average         ",1
"Right now I am sitting in my dorm room thinking about how much reading I have to finish tonight. I am listening to the radio as I write this. Jessica Simpson is what I am listening to. I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room. I think her roommate is playing the music. It sounds funny from here but oh well. I'm really tired from staying up so late of Friday night, but I guess that's what I get. This gum is already starting to lose flavor and I just barely put it in my mouth. Yuck! Blah! I got new sunglasses this weekend. I like them a lot. I got to shop some this weekend, and I bought more food for my room. I didn't need any of it, but it was definitely a spur of the moment type thing. I really need to read my Biology so I can read my Psychology so that I can take a shower and go to bed. It's only been 13 minutes since I began typing and I feel like I have been typing forever. I am worried about my Biology class and I hope I do good. I don't want to let anyone back home down. I want to be able to prove my ex friend wrong that I can be on my own, since she was to chicken to leave home. But I don't like her anyways, she has an obsession with thinking my world revolves around her, when obviously hers revolves around me. I don't know if that made sense, but I don't really care. Only five more minutes left and I am running out of things to write about. I got another email and now I am pretty sure it is my boyfriend. This is the longest 5 minutes of my life. I also have never made this many mistakes when I type. Oh well. I want to run downstairs and get myself some snacks. I wish I could go get some right now but I have to finish writing. I realize that I can't wait to get something over with and then when I start it I don't really feel like finishing it. Oh well, only a little bit more time left. Then I can cross this off my to-do list for the week. I miss my boyfriend so much, I cannot wait till he comes home. I get to go home next month! YAY! I can't wait to see my family and my puppy! I am thinking about all the times I had when I was at home. I had a sense of security there, I am very family oriented and I miss them a lot. Only 30 seconds left. And then I have more to do tonight. I have so much to do in so little time. Time to get it all done so I'm not swamped this week. ",1
"Hello my name is Joey michael Kindred and I am a biology major. I plan to go to medicall school some day and I hope to become an orthopeodic surgeon. I did not become interested in orthopeodic surgery until I hurt my knee the first game of the football season my senior year in high school. I tore three ligaments and blew seventy percent of my cartilage in my left knee. I used to want to be an orthodontist until this injury but my interests changed with the surgey and all. School is very importtant to me although in high school I can honestly say that I did not try my hardest. I did weell enough to get by and to get into the University of Texas but I did not do my best. From this point forward I strive to be the best that I can be in school and whatever I do so that I can get into a medical school, hopefully somewhere in Texas. I grew up and lived most of my childhood in dallas texas and that is where my dad lives. I have a lot of friends that live there and I really like dallas. It holds  a special place I my heart because of all of my experiences there. I moved to mIdland texas in the seventh grade and went to high school there at midland high. it is really neat to hear you talk about midland, Dr. Pennebaker, in our class. I had many great thigns happen to me while I was in midland and one of those things is my long term girlfriend of five years, Katy Kelly. She means the world to me and I  hope I mean the  world to her. She ended up at texas tech university but hopefully she is going to transfer to UT at the start of next school year for the fall of 2000. I am going to las vegas with her and her family in september for her birthday and I think that will be fun. it will be hot in las vegas and I look forward to seeing the beachboys and Alannis Morisette live at my hotel. I miss her terribly and I haven't seen her since the 20 of August. her mom and dad constantly send me email and little care packages and I hope someday I will marry this girl. I want to live somewhere in the country but somewhere that I don't have to drive that far to work. I want to live outside of a big city because I want to be a weell known doctor that people from all over teh country go to in order to get there bones fixed. that has always been a goal of mine and I plan to carry it out. I hope to have kids someday and raise them the same  way my dad raised me because I can't complain. I grew up in a chrch going family and just came to really know the Lord abotu two years ago. Church is very important to me although I havent found a church here in Austin that I am just wild about. I am a freshman yousee and I havenot been heree that long. that is my life story wrapped up in just a little bit of time but I guess that was my stream of conciousness because that is what I thought about when I was writing.

"I just came back home to Austin from Houston this morning. It was not a bad drive today. I am now at home relaxing for the remainder of the day. I really kind of miss home but I guess I will get used to living on my own after a little while. I miss my parents and girlfriend. It is hard to leave the people you care about the most knowing you won't see them for a period of time. Hopefully though I will start to meet many new people here at the University of Texas. I really like Austin, now I just need to explore it. I know a few people up here and they have helped make it a lot easier to be here. I hope school is not too terribly hard. I know I must study and do all of my assignments and make sure I do not fall behind. I think reading and attending class are two of the most important elements of college. I am somewhat scared though at the fact that three tests comprise your semester grade. If you do bad on an exam, you will really have to work hard to pull yourself back up. I just don't know?  I need to get into the routine of college before I can give a valid evaluation of what college really is to me. I hope I do well. Enough with school. I am so excited to be living on my own. I have new responsibilities as well as many new freedoms. There is nobody here to tell me when to come home or what to do. I am the superior. With this new freedom though I know I must watch and take care of myself. No one is here to pick up after me and no one is here to watch over me which is kind of frightening. It creates a sense of happiness, but at the same time a sense of fear also. ",1
"I can't wait until tomorrow. I have only one class from 9 to 10 and then its time to go to the Matchbox 20 concert. I love Christie so much and I can't what to see her tomorrow. Christie, I hope you'll give me another chance some day. Your the best thing thats ever happened in my life. God I've changed so much this summer. I am so excited about pledgeship. I love you mom. I am going to study my rear off though to get a 4. 0. I wish I was living at Towers because Jester SUCKS. And the food is nothing special at all. I got to ask mom and dad for some cash. I really can't wait to get back to Houston to see everybody there and especially Dean, Cassie, Mrs. Smith, and of course Christie. I need to keep working out. It's doing me alot of good. Carter needs to tone it down in there so that I can finish this paper. Holy cow my mind just went blank. Oh wait a minute. 2 great looking girls are swimming over at the Theta house. I hope the Rockets win it all next year because the Bulls are really pissing me off. College is going to be tough but I think I will do just fine. I am going to be more than successful one day. I don't hope this, I know this. For the love of God. I type so slow it's not even funny. That's what I need to do is take a typing class because this is ridiculously to short and it should be much longer. Only one more minute of writing and then I'll. . . . . . Oh, what do you know. times up. ",1
"I'm busier than a one legged man in a butt-kicking' contest!  I heard some statistic about how much college kids watch TV and I can honestly say that the only TV I've watched since I've been here is the football game because I haven't had enough time. I have a job, I'm in air force ROTC, I'm in a fraternity, and I'm on a couple intramural football teams. I have all of this to do after studying and doing homework. I don't think that I feel really stressed about anything, of course no grades have come out yet, but physically its very demanding. One day in ROTC  I threw up 4 times as a result of probably being out of shape, but for the next week I just felt sick to my stomach. Some of that might have something to do with the food in jester being the greasiest, most repetitive food I've ever eaten. Also, I've lost 10 pounds since I've been here which disturbs me cause I used to work out every day and it sucks now that I can't. Another subject that is scaring me is money. My parents pay for college, but I didn't realize how much id already be spending. My dad always told me to limit myself to a monthly budget, but of course I didn't listen to his advice and now I might be paying for it. literally. My class load isn't that bad except for calculus. This damn class is kicking my ass. first of all, my professor doesn't speak English very well, but sometimes that doesn't even matter because in a class of 150 students he refuses to wear a microphone or even speak up so that anyone beyond the first three rows can hear him. And when we can hear him he speaks in some sort of math language so that when I take notes I'm sure that when I look at them later I will of thought that they were notes from some ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics class or something. So classes are going well!, now socially I have been having lots of fun. I've been lucky enough to meet a lot of girls but not smart enough to not date so many. I'm pretty sure I have a problem of leading girls on. For example there is this one girl who I've been hanging out with who I think ones to get a little more serious with me. Now I'm just a freshman and I don't want to get serious with anyone yet!  But if I try to conspicuously avoid her (I still call and am nice to her, I just don't go to her house or anything) she, like most girls, pick up on that almost instantaneously, then she tries to make me feel guilty for say not coming to see her or something. Along with that there are some other girls who I've been talking to or seeing at parties. I guess you could say that I've been casually dating around, but next week there is this huge party and I'm really looking forward to it, but not to the awkward feeling of seeing all of these girls together at the same time because I'm sure all of them are going to be there. oh well!! I still love college. ",1
"  right now I'm thinking about my poor roomates because one of them, Lauren, just found that her little sister woke up this morning to find a bullet hole in her window!  If her bed would've positioned different she would've been dead!  I'm also thinking about my other roomate, Anna, she just found out that she didn't get the job that she wanted because she doesn't have time to go through training. I'm also kind of stressed because one of the reasons I came to this school is to do crew and now I'm nervous I'm not going to make the team, aghh. I also am stressed because I have a lot of homerwork to do right now such as reading for psychology and writing my english paper. It's also hard because I miss my family and wonder why I'm here, but then I think how I wouldn't be happier anywhere else. And then I'm wondering about who's going to be reading this and wondering if they think I'm a psycho and then I wonder, is anyone going to be reading this?  go figure. I'm also really excited to be here be because I hate the snow in Wisconsin (where I'm from) and am so excited not to  be cold here this winter. But I miss all my friends and hope they are happy where they are to. One of my best friends sisters said that in your first two weeks of college you change in ways more than you could ever fathom and you are such a different person the day you walk into your dorm and the day that you walk out. At college you have time to discover who you really are, and that is really cool you, or at least I, can discover who I am without the distractions of my family, my responsibilities, and my friends. In Texas no one knows who I am so I can reinvent myself to be whatever way I like, I can take time to discover if I really like myself and if I don't I have four years to change myself into the person that I want to be, wow I really like that it sounds nice. I just hope that I meet all the people I can and I hope I can get some best friends, I also worry about money and the fact that I'm spending it and not making it. Sometimes I'm so stingy. I also worry about how my family is going to survive without me (I know that sounds selfish) but I do a lot of things such as being a peacemaker  between my sisters and cleaning up after my dog who isn't potty-trained and driving my sisters around and running errands for my parents, I'm sure they'll be fine I just in a way hope that they aren't so that they miss me. I hope that this writing piece doesn't seem self-centered because I'm just writing about myself. I just don't know what else to write about. I'm also listening to Etta James, I love her voice it is so awesome. oww my hands are sore I could never be a secretary.  My major is actually elementary ed with a minor in psychology. I'm really excited to be a teacher but sometimes I wonder how I can be so excited about it or if I'm setting feminism  back because I will be happy in such a traditional role. But hey whatever floats your boat right?  Sometimes I get so excited about the way I'm going to decorate my classroom and the curicullum I'm going to teach. I'm also very excited to take all the classes that are required for my major. They should all be very exciting and hopefully the professors will be enthusiastic because how could they not be they are training us to go into their profession. It's so exciting how college is the step before my real job my whole life I have been preparing for college and now I'm in college and preparing for my next step, my job.   ",1
I still do not understand why my father after twenty years of marriage to my mother decides out of the blue that he is not happy and to get a divorce. why he feels that he needs to be with that other slut. my mother has been a great wife to him and without her he would probably be nowhere today. he thinks that just because he will give her money that she will be okay without him. but money can't buy happiness. I just hope that my little brother is a okay he is only twelve years old and he gets sad when he thinks about his dad not being there I just do not know how I am going to be ready for my test on Wednesday I have to study way too much for the next two days and I need to get an a in biology I need to do good in all of my classes to raise my GPA I just  hope that my mom does good on her test also because she has been working hard to make the grade my little brother has been working hard in football to get the starting position with his little friends I wish that could just go back to being a little kid when everything was okay with my parents and I did not have to worry about anything but just being a little kid I would not need to worry about anything hopefully he will come back to his senses and come back home ,1

"This is a stream of consciousness paper for my psych. class. That is the only class I actually enjoy going to. They have about a katrillion people in that class and it is freezing cold, but that's okay. Almost all my classes except for English have 456,897,456,789 people in it. There is a cute guy in almost every single one of my classes, or if not in class, on the way to it. That's what college is all about. That's why I came from Louisiana to Texas. New people. It's so different out here. I love my roommates. They are so cute, and have really cute friends. I have one that is my favorite though. That's Gibby. He's so cute. anyway Lisa is so mad that the damn computer won't work. I believe that is a direct quote. She want to go call Adam, her lifeguard lover. Sometimes I think she's jealous because I found my little Gilbert within 5 days of coming to the great state of Texas. At first I didn't like it here, but now I love it. I know 345,231,859,635 guys, and about 4 girls. Today I got to go with Brady, our fine neighbor to go wash his Rodeo. I got to vacuum. It was great. I love him. But not as much as I (secretly) love room 1432.  The bus rides have been hell, but we ride with the neighbors. I hate to stand up. I hate that almost as much as I hate not sitting on the end of a row in class. I think it's the extra elbow room that I get. I hate those desks too. I am used to having about 565 sq. feet of desk area. Oh well. Anyway, yesterday, I bought Gibby some boxer shorts. I gave the salesman a hard time because I didn't know any of his sizes. oh, well. I don't want  to limit myself so soon after coming to Texas. I want someone to play with, but I also want some time to explore the great wide dating field. There is a nasty rumor going around the apartment saying that Marc likes me. I think Marc is an awesome guy, but I don't know how willing I am to give Gibby up. It has gotten to the point where everyone asks me where Gilbert is, and what he's doing. Okay, I may talk to the boy but I don't know every single blessed move he makes. Now as for Dark Chad across the street I would like to know. He is so cute and artsy and he is an avid fan of party girl. okay I think my time is up, so Ill say good bye till tomorrow. Thank you, Simone Theriot ",1
"There are so many things on my mind today. I am still trying to get the hang of college life and trying to cope with the new change. Everything here at UT is so different. College is different. It is not what I expected it to be or even what I had imagined. Do not get me wrong, I love UT, it is just that I am use to the High school ways. You know, the whole part of being spoon fed. Here I have to be responsible, be an adult, make my own decisions, and I am just not ready for that quite yet. UT is so huge and diverse. There are so many people and organizations. Right now I feel overwhelmed and a little out of place. I guess it is because I am a Freshman, but I know that I will get over it soon. I have been missing my family, friends, and boyfriend so much today. You see I have never really been away from home for more than a week, so this is really new to me. It is an experience. One that I know is going to change my life forever. All night I have been thinking of everything and how new all of it is, and it has made me a little scared and nervous. I have even felt a little stressed out about it. And now I have this thought in my head that I won't make it here at UT. But I know that it is just a thought and that all I have to do is adapt to this new change and work my hardest to make it be successful. I have four years here at UT. I plan to make them the best. Besides, I have always loved this school. Ever since I was a little girl this has been my dream school. And now that I am here I am going to make the best of it. I have the pride. I have the spirit. All I need to do is believe in myself and do my very best. UT is the best and I am very glad that I chose to come here. So in all, I guess the way I am feeling is pretty normal for a Freshman. I just need to get the hang of things and everything will be alright. Hook 'em Horns. ",1
"My roommate is trying to sleep, so I hope that I am not going to bug her by typing. I'm using her computer because mine is at home. I have no idea how to use the internet I need to go get my e-mail address so that I have one but I don't feel like it. I still have to get my books for two more classes tomorrow morning- I can't forget that. I miss my boyfriend- I hope he comes down this weekend cuz' I can't go up there again till he comes down to see me-I just wouldnt feel tight about it. He is such a jerk-I wish I could just meet someone else and get over him but it's so hard. I can't believe that Heather and Sebastian broke up this weekend-that's so sad. It seems so weird that relationships can totally dissolve so fast-where do the bonds you had with these people go so suddenly?  Relationships are so weird-love is weird. I would really like to meet someone that I am as attracted to as I am to Matt and that I love undoubtedly and someone who I know loves me that way, too. I would give anything to know exactly hoe Matt feels about me-why does he still have to play games with me-I f he cares about me, he should tell me-I do. I wonder what he will think when he gets that letter-I hope it doesn't freak him out-maybe I should have sent it-he's probably going to let all his friends read it and then I'll feel like a dumbass like always. I keep making mistakes and I know we aren't supposed to worry about them but I can't quit fixing them. I wonder if anyone will actually ever read this?  I wish my roommates boyfriend and his friend would leave-they've been here three freaking days-thats a little inconsiderate-I think and she keeps drinking all my lemonade-doesn't she realize that costs me money-I wouldnt care if she'd ask-but that is so rude, she doesn't even say thank you. That guy gives me the creeps and he just sits on our coach all day. I wish Emily and Lori could call me with their phone number-I really miss them. I need to call Cynthia, too, and see what sorority she got into. I wonder if she's seen Emily and Lori-will that all stay friends?  I feel left out-I wonder in Cynthia saw the bracelets-she will be so pissed at me if she did-I'll call her after 5. I can't wait to go play volleyball-I've got to finish my drama reading after this, too. I wonder if I am doing this right-I can't tell exactly what thoughts to write cuz some come to me while I'm writing others and then I lose them-I  need to write a poem-I've been losing so many good ideas and that pisses me off. only 11 more minutes to go. I havent typed in along time,  I would love to be with Matt right now-I am so glad that I haven't been thinking about him as much as I did before we moved-That would kill me, maybe I'm shielding myself a little cuz I still; feel like he is going to be the first person to really really hurt me-why is it that my self esteem hinges so much on his interest in me?  That is certainly not healthy, why did I just type certainly instead of definitely was thinking defiunatle, that was an idea for a poem that I still havent written down I need to remember that-I hope I like my poetry class-it will suck if I hate it after all the trouble I went to get in it. I'm glad that the part about my roommates boyfriend is gone now, I'm afraid shed walk in and read it-now she'll walk in and read this-oh well-three days is too long-I wonder if Matt will stay the night here when he comes or at t8m's house of that other guy who lives in Austin. I am anxious to go to College Station thought, but will I stay at Matt's house or at Emily and Lori's house. Will that be mad at me if I stay at Matt's. The computer just went back to the main menu cuz I guess I pushed Ctrl-whatever that menas-2 more minutes-I am so glad I didn't just lose the whole thing-I'd have been pissed beyond belief-my hands are getting tired. I have heartburn from my dada's chili still-I hate chili-why did I eat that anyway?  I can't believe Princess Diana is dead-it seems so weird-she is just as vulnerable as anyone but it never seems that way-now two princesses have died in car accidents-cars are so dangerous-time is up-Yay!

"My first reaction to this assignment was to just write that I felt nothing and perhaps continue writing that for 20 minutes; however, I am interested in where this is going. Right now my boyfriend is poking me as he displays how I can touch-type and he cannot. The other day, we went to go and buy fish. We drove around Austin I don't know how many times just looking for pet stores. We drove to Highlands Mall, Lakeline Mall, Petsmart, and Petco. I finally, after searching and carefully chosing, found fish that were supposed. It really upset me that out of the 4 fish that I bought, none of them adapted well in the fish tank environment I previously had. The sole fish that I possessed in that tank ate all of the food I would drop into the tank continuously. It really began to bother me when I saw him nipping at the other fish's tails. So, I took matters into my own hands and separated him from my new, smaller fish. I understand that these unpleasant changes were my own fault. I knew that I was supposed to introduce the new fish into that environment slower and in a certain, specific procedure. Well, I finally figured out that things wouldn't work out between my old fish and the new fish, so I eliminated the problem by flushing the big fish. I am really suprised that I did this because I am such a humanitarian. For example, whenever my other fish would die, I would get other people to remove them from the tank because I couldn't deal with the dead fish. I always felt as though they were looking at me. There is one instance where I did flush other live fish, but once again, it was for the good of the aquarium. I don't know, I think I have always had such a problem with death. It scares me, but it doesn't. For example, I used to work at a hospital in San Antonio, when I was a junior in high school. This is where I had my first real encounter with death. I never had to experience death in my family, in friends, or aquaintences. However, since then I have had to deal with it several times. I guess I take that back, I have had to deal with death one time before, but it was in eighth grade. I can't remember all the minute details of it, but it really brought me and one of my friends together. Anyhow, this hospital death experience really opened my eyes to the whole death scenario. And I know this sounds corney, but every single time I have had to deal with death since then, I have seen a little yellow butterfly. This spiritual experience has consistently happened to me on about 5 or 6 occasions. Well, my 20 minutes is up. ",1
"john is talking a lot. I don't care if a lot is supposed to be 2 separate words. I like this song. wow It's already been 1 minute. I guess I just think slowly. hmmm, my mind just went blank. oh crap, I have 4 classes tomorrow. did I finish all my homework yet?  oh shit, I have a lot of calculus to catch up on. I've only done like 1 assignment out of 4!  John is talking to Alice and it's interrupting my stream of consciousness. hey. if you're unconscious, and you have a dream, is that stream of Unconsciousness??  hahaahahaha  that's a cool thought!!   ahhahahha!! oh cool, my friend is online!  she was at the party on Saturday that I dj'ed. I thought I dj'ed crappy but everyone says I DJ like a club DJ. I wish I could DJ Austin but Austin is owned by DJ boombai. I wonder if he's any good. he uses records instead of CD's. I hear he spins hip hop. I guess I have a chance since I mix club music and not hip hop. Sam is instant messaging me!  argh, I've written so much and it's only been 5 minutes. do I really have to do this for 20 minutes?  this is pretty brainless. I wish all writing assignments were like this. wow it's late already. I go to sleep too late everyday. I better go to sleep early. all we do is watch TV. marc mcgwire broke the homerun record today. that's pretty cool. I wonder how Sammy sosa feels. I bet he's happy for him but deep inside he was like ""damn, I almost had it!""  he still has a chance though. wow my bed is messy. the covers are like everywhere. I like my posters. chow yun-fat's gun is cool looking. Acura integra is such a cool car, especially the type R. I wish I had a type R. after college, I want to get a type R. I wonder if I'll be rich after college. I hope I'm rich. I wonder what my future will be like. I wonder if I'll be living in an apartment or a house. I wonder when I'll get married. I want to get married around 25 - 29. I wonder who I'll marry. I wonder if it'll be my girlfriend right now. I really like her a lot. I can't imagine being without her. she was at the party on Saturday too. I wonder if anyone else will get me to DJ their parties. I hope so - I want to make some extra money. what the hell kind of song is this?  mp3's are the coolest things!  I can download them for free and burn them onto a CD and make my own favorite CD's. I might go for a masters degree. I might get more money. I know!  when I get my bachelors, I'll look for a high paying job. then if I don't get a good job, I'll go back for the masters. I can imagine myself as a traveling type of businessman, getting up early in the morning, taking a shower, putting on my armani suit, kissing my wife goodbye, driving my Benz to work, coming back in rush hour traffic, and doing it all over again. ooh how long has it been?  it's been 15 minutes. cool!  I'm almost done with this one. I wonder how long the next assignment is. I still have to do that pretesting thing. Ben and Tony have been gone for a long time. I wonder when they'll be back. I wonder what they're doing. did they work out or hoop?  my girlfriend is a private investigator. hahhahhahaa  lethal weapon 4 was a cool movie. jet li is awesome. he kicks ass. I wonder if I'll have time to take martial arts next year. should I take capoeira or kung fu with my because?  I hate this song. john's taking a shower. something is beeping. my contacts are dry. I want to play starcraft. that's a fun game. I like to build up and overwhelm the opponent. oop, times up. ",1
"I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words, but of deeds. Better days through better ways. That's all of the Creed to the FFA I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times. I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income. I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic. I will say that by typing, my spelling improves. My hand writing is horrible. I can bearly read the things I write. I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them. Man, this room is hot. I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot. I want to take guitar and speed reading classes. Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement. Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now. I supose the speed reading class might be. I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot. I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it. My memmory has been getting worse daily. Not just because of the alcohol consumption. I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school. I'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately, and I think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better. My girl friend of over a year and a half and I broke up a couple weeks ago, but continued to date. The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people. I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes. She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too. She still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side. One of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place. I feel this pain inside me I've never felt before when I hear her talking about going places with him. But like my roommate says, there's nothing like a good jam secion. He's talking about music, but I want to jam with some other girls. Get my mind off of her. I know that the migranes and headaches are from her, and that she really is being selfish most of the time, and she's not really my ""type,""  if there is a type for anyone. But I find myself unable to stop thinking about her. I met another girl the other day who has more incommon with me than anyone I've ever met. She's beautiful and got into UT. That means brains and beauty. She's just coming off of a break up from her long time boyfriend through high school as well. My main hesitation about persuing her is that I don't want either of us to mentaly, or physically, get involved just because we think we need someone at the moment. Besides, I think she's too active for me. she's the social director of her sorority. Another thing that's been stressing me out is the fact that my cholesterol is 253, and my LDL (the bad kind) is 183, higher than most people's total. The doctor told me I needed to get on medication as sooon as possible and gave me sample packages that should last me atleast a month to be sure I had time to get my perscription filled. My first thought was to get a second opinion about the medication, but I feel confident that any doctor would tell me the same thing. I would tell someone the same thing and I don't have a degree. But I can't convince my self to take it. No studies have been done to document the sideeffects of the medication on someone as young as my self. When I asked the Doctor about them, she said that I should just take half the recomended dosage and I should be okay. I decided against the medication and I've drastically changed my eating habbits, althought I didn't think they were that bad to begin with. I've never been out of shape persay, but I can tell my body's getting back into shape. I used to be very fit, but after quitting high school sports my junior year, I began to slack off. And I found the girl that I just recently broke up with, so doing workout stuff didn't compare to her. I think I'm going to start running soon. I'm lifing now more then I get my cardio up, and while it's helping my muscles get back to looking right, I don't think it's giving me the help that I need. We, the people in my apartment, have decided, because of me, to each by their own groceries. I was tired of paying for all the stuff they eat when I wouldn't have any of it. I was buying all my stuff extra anyway, and they still wanted me to pay 25 bucks a aweek for ""community food""  looks like my time is up. Adios         ",1
"3:34 twenty minutes to write what I am thinking Well, I am writing this at a time when I should be in class, but at least I am doing my homework. Between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, I think I have this class covered. I must admit I hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. When ever I get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, I can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. Don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. The guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. I know him, and has just said hello, The only reason I know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is Hot. Holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. This is really fucked up. I am trying to evesdrop as I write this. He is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. Why does she date hIM? He's so nasty. I'm hungry, I ate not to long ago, maybe I want a cigarette. Busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument NAZI. He was on the sick out we all hate him. Some dude I don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, It was funny, I am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. I am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. I am hungry, I wonder what happened in class today I'll just read the next chapter of the book, I like the book it is interesting. Lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell Friday, actually every day is good when I am not in class and don't have anything to do. The dude next to me started talking to me, I hate him, I don't even know what he said. Hey 3:54 see you bye ",1
"It's too late to really be writing anything I think but then again I'm here aren't I? Hard to believe I am if you were to ask me where I was going to be twenty years from now it wouldn't be here. I miss my Mom and Dad though I'm not supposed to be there either. Isn't there a time when you're supposed to stop writing about your mom and dad. I'm worried that I'm not writing what I'm supposed to or that I'm not doing this naturally What is naturally anyways I mean it seems like kind of a cop out really. Naturally is a lot harder to accomplish than it looks wouldn't you say oh whoa is me I keep messing up my words and I'm not sure if this is even supposed to look pretty or what the thing with this stupid laptop is how stupid it really is It keeps on jumping up and down to the thing or in the middle of this it so it is impossible to get things down. Is natural easy for you? I wonder if that is true It's even harder to believe it is only 12 32 Whatever happened to going to bed early? I was going to attempt to do that you know Go to bed early It seems that whenever I am away from home these things occur The thing is I do this all the time. write without thinking except I do think about how things are spelled and I can't do this now Or it would take way too much time. Are you guys actually going to read this? I'm sure there are many others who are writing more fascinating things than me. I wish I could think of something funny to say then maybe I'd get an A what's funny I wonder. I wish I was in bed I'm sooo tired I haven't slept a wink I'm so tired my mind is on the brink I wonder should I get up and get myself a drink oh oh o oh I'm so tired Oh who will save your soul to me that means everything you know the songs in your head have nowhere to go except leaving the words on the page an I supposed to be speaking in poetry here? Or will I get counted off ? Are you supposed to be wondering what you get counted off for in college I wonder? My fingers are starting to hurt but the only way I can write this stream of consciousness is by lifting my hands off the keyboard because otherwise the problem arises. I've been thinking about SMU lately and how much I miss it? But do I? What is here for me that SMU doesn't have Why friends of course yet do I have friends? I have Scott I guess though I wish more than anything I had more maybe he'd like me better Shoulders are always cramping up do they do that in others ? In tours Whose reading this anyways? Are my thoughts interesting to you I wish I had a yewl leaf or a yule log Yule that's such a cool word reminds me of Christmas I sound like a goddamn Theater major being all dramatic. What is so wrong with being dramatic I wonder What is so wrong with wanting people to see you/. anyway/. I look at all these people and I criticize them all the time I even criticize scott and I wish I didn't because then I think life would be much easier to live in I don't think anyone's as negative as I am Has it been twenty minutes yet? Oh I have ten left. I wish I could get in side the teacher's but then would I really like what I see. sounding like a theater major again and the roses are blooming outside but they'll be dead soon because they are so lovey all the flowers I have die it seems. I got to get out of this place but then where will you go You want to go to another body but you know the problems will be just as frightening there Travis Craig Maria Todd Ben Jamie, Paige Ben what happened to you all? How come I never was on your crowd? How come you never thought I was cool enough to include in your circle? To respect? To invite? You know I think I would have stopped being so goddamn nice if you had invited me not made me feel like I had to try so hard to be your friend but I don't understand why I had to try so hard? What was wrong with me? I guess it was just sitting down with you all. I couldn't think of anything to say to you and now I can't think of anything to say to anyone? Does that mean they all think of me the same way? Am I doomed to be uncool forever/ Will I ever have that group of friends that I love to watch from afar? I keep trying and trying. I wonder what I would have possibly have done to be happier at SmU? I wanted to be their center of attention. I think I could have handled it if boys hit on me,. but they never did you know. I think I could have handled it if they had come up to me and said hey. you know were going to a movie tonight do you want to come? We really want you too,. I really want you too. And have it not be on a school night for God's sake. I mean that was half my problem I never went to anyone's house on a school night. I wanted to study. Was that so bad? And I guess I just felt very intimidated when I went over there because all I could really do was watch. I could never really join in because they didn't think it was worth listening to ? Or was it my fault because I just didn't try? Now I'm here and I don't feel any different at the coop except at this point I really don't care if they accept me or not because I have tons of more important things to do. I have my time school you know School take up like Scott's work and your theater and everything. , UT is my life now,. ,. my best friend I guess. What is a best friend anyway? Everyone has their faults I guess a best friend is someone oh times up. ",1
"He will be nineteen this Saturday. I think I am going to go crazy trying to get something for the boy who has everything. He just left my dorm room. and we just had a fight. he is going to his apartment to check if his dog made a mess on the carpet. I think he likes his dog more than me sometimes. I am listening to the soundtrack of the tape that I do yoga to because it soothes me. when I do yoga I am so calm. I actually feel very centered and like my whole body is in a perfect line when have finished the whole tape, its an hour long and it really is a workout. my mom got me started on yoga, she's totally addicted now. I am too, but I'm going into withdrawal because there is nowhere in the castilian where I could do it. I am going home to Dallas this weekend and I'll get to see my whole family!!  my mom will make some really good dinner for me because she thinks I'm starving here. I'm not but there's just nothing good to eat. everybody loves the food that their mom cooks them though. I went home last weekend too. the people down the hall are being so noisy . I want to change this CD, I think I just fell into a trance. I do think I was in a trance this morning in biology. my roommate was up until 6 this morning doing some paper and she kept waking me up. she takes a lot of my stuff without asking , and that's not cool. Oh well , she's cool otherwise. I've got other homework to start now so I don't keep her up tonight!!! ",1
"I wish I had a car though, but I think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until I can afford one. But I will always get by, I know. Well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so I still have to wake up at 7 am even though I have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. Well I didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. That's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her GPA so maybe just maybe she can come to Austin and live somewhere around here. I wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. Anyway, I'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. It's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 70 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 50 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. Just kept on saying ""Can you feel that!"" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. I guess that's the focus to my whole life. Not sure if that's good or bad or what. Probably what got me in trouble last semester when I was half way thru the semester. Pretty crazy that I'm my worst enemy, but in a way, I guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if I didn't kick my own butt to do better who would?  So I just keep on chugging. I don't know why I'm so success driven?  Lord knows I'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but I never can seem to do that. Try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. Oh well. I'll probably grow out of it (please please please). So enough of that, I hope the Aggies have lost against FSU because then I get to email my Ag friends and laugh. But then again that might not be the greatest idea if the Horns don't fair that well this year. Don't know what I'm listening to on the radio now. Oh yea ACDC!! Rock on! Anyway, I loved that Howard Stern movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. Movies, that's a topic. I love going to see movies. Just like the escape I guess. Thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with Kevin Spacy Usual Suspects, that movie was great. Also, that Primal Fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe. I was getting all sorts of recommendations from the guy at blockbuster this past Friday (yes I was a pathetic party pooper but I did manage to do some socializing). Anyway I get these movies and come home. Now I'm already disappointed because I have this great new TV in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but Fox thru a lot of colored snow. So I figure I'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. But NOOOOOO, the VCR is goofed or something. It may have something to do with the tracking, but I don't have the tape anymore so I can't experiment. I'm usually very good which technical things. I knew everything about my first VCR before it came out of the box. But last Friday was definately not my day (triple low I've heard it called). But oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (MOM's) sauce so that was good. Not a complete loss. Man I would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. So anyway, I have 5 minutes or so to type. I have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. Tell you anything about me?  Actually, I'm a pretty neat ship keeper; I do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of  course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) TV box. But until the cable guy comes on Wed. , it'll probably stay there. I have to make sure that I can support my mother beginning this summer because I think she may need it at some point. Wish I had a godsent car that would work and then I could probably swing insurance payments and gas, but with car payments it'd be too much. Oh my, listening to Eye of the Tiger, how old is that?!?!?! So, maybe I should just go to sleep after writing this. I need to go see if I can to the pretesting for this class, but I tried before this and couldn't get it to load up. Something about the server being down. Well, such is life. I think I should do pretty good this semester, shooting for a 4. 0 again.

The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone

among fir trees, but it took him an hour

for the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,

the village passed him by, greeted him,

asked about his health, but everybody hurried

to catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,

measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.

He yearned for the day when the new church

would be built—right across the road. Now

it rises above the moon: saints in frescoes

meet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut

through the shingles on the roof of his empty

house. The apple trees have taken over the sky,

sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.

Behind the silo, the Mother Rabbit

hunches like a giant spider with strange calm:

six tiny babies beneath, each

clamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.

This may sound cute to you, reading

from your pulpit of plenty,

but one small one was left out of reach,

a knife of fur

barging between the others.

I watched behind a turret of sand. If

I could have cautioned the mother rabbit

I would. If I could summon the

Bunnies to fit him in beneath

the belly's swell

I would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishing

for some equity. This must be

why it's called Wild Life because of all the

crazed emotions tangled up in

the underbrush within us.

Did I tell you how

the smallest one, black and trembling,

hopped behind the kudzu

still filigreed with wanting?

Should we talk now of animal heritage, their species,

creature development? And what do we say

about form and focus—

writing this when a stray goes hungry, and away.

Invisible fish swim this ghost ocean now described by waves of sand, by water-worn rock. Soon the fish will learn to walk. Then humans will come ashore and paint dreams on the dying stone.

Don’t bother the earth spirit who lives here. She is working on a story. It is the oldest story in the world and it is delicate, changing.

Is anything central?

Orchards flung out on the land,

Urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?

Are place names central?

Elm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?

As they concur with a rush at eye level

Beating themselves into eyes which have had enough

Thank you, no more thank you.

And they come on like scenery mingled with darkness

The damp plains, overgrown suburbs,

Places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.

 

These are connected to my version of America

But the juice is elsewhere.

This morning as I walked out of your room

After breakfast crosshatched with

Backward and forward glances, backward into light,

Forward into unfamiliar light,

Was it our doing, and was it

The material, the lumber of life, or of lives

We were measuring, counting?

A mood soon to be forgotten

In crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow

In this morning that has seized us again?

 

I know that I braid too much on my own

Snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.

They are private and always will be.

Where then are the private turns of event

Destined to bloom later like golden chimes

Released over a city from a highest tower?

The quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,

And you know instantly what I mean?

What remote orchard reached by winding roads

Hides them? Where are these roots?

 

It is the lumps and trials

That tell us whether we shall be known

And whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.

All the rest is waiting

For a letter that never arrives,

Day after day, the exasperation

Until finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,

The two envelope halves lying on a plate.

The message was wise, and seemingly

Dictated a long time ago, but its time has still

Not arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited

Steps that can be taken against danger

Now and in the future, in cool yards,

In quiet small houses in the country,

Our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.

Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.

She couldn't help but sting my finger,

clinging a moment before I flung her

to the ground. Her gold is true, not the trick

evening light plays on my roses.

She curls into herself, stinger twitching,

gilt wings folded. Her whole life just a few weeks,

and my pain subsided in a moment.

In the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.

No warning from either of us:

she sleeping in the richness of those petals,

then the hand, my hand, cupping the bloom

in devastating force, crushing the petals for the scent.

And she mortally threatened, wholly unaware

that I do this daily, alone with the gold last light,

in what seems to me an act of love.

I will not speak ill of Jack Flick.

I will rarely look

one summer at the lake.

I won't speak ill of Jack whose freckles

and gangly legs are gone.

So is the drained face I saw when he saw

what he'd done with a sharp rock

nonchalantly skipped.

I will speak well, for it was somewhat

sweet to lie on the dock while Jack

I will speak well of them,

in the landfill; boy with the shy mouth playing his guitar

at the picnic table, out in the dirt yard.

Only one hour here stiffens the barbs into thousands

of quick retorts. Everything this well-guarded

I planted an apple tree in memory

of my mother, who is not gone,

 

but whose memory has become

so transparent that she remembers

 

slicing apples with her grandmother

(yellow apples; blue bowl) better than

 

the fruit that I hand her today. Still,

she polishes the surface with her thumb,

 

holds it to the light and says with no

hesitation, Oh, Yellow Transparent . . . 

 they're so fragile, you can almost seeto the core. She no longer remembers how

 

to roll the crust, sweeten the sauce, but

her desire is clear—it is pie that she wants.

 

And so, I slice as close as I dare to the core—

to that little cathedral to memory—where

 

the seeds remember everything they need

to know to become yellow and transparent.

The entrance at the back of the complex

led onto a road, where an upended couch

tilted into a ditch and a washing machine

gleamed avocado beneath pine needles.

 

From the end, you turned left and left again,

then cut a trail to find the cul-de-sac

of bright brick houses. We'd walk as far

as we dared before a man pushing a mower

 

might stop to ask, ""whadda you boys need?""

That was a question we could never answer.

I loved the name of the place, White Hall,

imagined that each interior was a stretch

 

of marble perfect wall adorned by smiling

photos of the family. Our own halls

were brailled with nail holes of former

tenants, the spackled rounds of fists.

 

But doesn't longing clarify the body?

The boys I left behind: Tommy, wearing

the World War II trenching tool;

Danny, whose father, so much older

 

than the other parents, died in his recliner

one sunny afternoon while watching baseball;

Duke, who stole his mother's car and crashed

into a wall. Boys who knew when you were posing,

 

waiting for someone to say, ""smile."" Boys

who, on those latch-key days, held themselves

in narrow passages when no one

was there to show them what to do.

Why are you still seventeen

and drifting like a dog after dark,

dragging a shadow you’ve found?

 

Put it back where it belongs,

and that bend of river, too. That’s not the road

Gone are the cars that crawl to town

from the reactors, a parade of insects, metallic,

fuming along the one four-lane street.

 

The poplars of the shelterbelt lean away

from the bypass that never had much to pass by

but coyote and rabbitbrush.

 

Pinpricks stabbed in a map too dark to read—

I stared at stars light-years away.

               I got a call from the White House, from the

President himself, asking me if I’d do him a personal

favor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.

President, anything you like.” He said, “Just act

like nothing’s going on. Act normal. That would

mean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,

sure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’s

how I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’m

tortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”

bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I was

dying to tell someone that the President himself called

me, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure to

act normal was killing me. And what was going on

anyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. I

saw the President on TV yesterday. He was shaking

hands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really a

farmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenly

I was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.

I looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked more

like I was trying to be normal. That’s pretty

suspicious. I opened the door and looked around.

What was going on? There was a car parked in front

of my car that I had never seen before, a car that

was trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.

If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise

people will think something’s going on. I got into

my car and sped down the road. I could feel those

little radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,

but, apparently, they were under orders not to stop

me. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’s

going on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.

I hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Just

getting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t know

you had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.

You’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes I

refer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a private

joke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” she

asked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promise

you. Everything is normal. The President shook

hands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that such

a big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “and

that man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, I

know,” I said, feeling better.

knowing he had reached the end of something though it was not end enough.

Of course kisses, the stages of kissing like running borders,

endless conversations, stations of the cross, till even the promise of kissing bores you,

a clown take off his nose at the end of the day, the memory

of how your mother laid roses, sweetheart roses, on the cold grate of the fireplace,

waiting out the storm with a sheep

of gleaming red tomatoes held out to you eight at a time.

If they ask you how it felt, say solitary,

at first the ease of sleeping alone, warm without even a sheet,

then the nonchalance of a dirt road leading down the hill, its dust

raised and re-raised in plumes as each guest departed,

and later, say it was like the blind cat that came out of nowhere

to lie on your tile floor, lifting its face to stare with white marble eyes.

If they ask what you heard, tell them the single note of the watchman,

who coughed his one syllable when you went to bed,

and at the end of every dream when you woke with a simple plea—stay, go—again, the cough of the watchman.

If they ask about thirst, tell them no one could carry water as far

as it had to go, so that when it was time to rest,

people went to the spigot at the edge of the train tracks

and cupped their hands under the water, lowering their faces to drink.

Tell them a man could stand at noon in the park wearing nothing but underwear

and beg for hours with his cup empty.

Tell them you could sit quietly while phrases you didn't know you knew 

rose up in the language there and on an undisturbed lake in your mind 

you could back float—that weightless prayer that prays Let me die with my toes pointing up at the sun.

When they ask what people will eventually get around to asking, 

How was the food? Tell them batata, mamón, guanábana, maní,

indigenous crops exchanging places with hunger,

giving up to the dark store window whose inventory is one hand

of bananas sold one banana at a time, giving up to little pyramids of limes

by the side of the road and the kids who tend them, dreaming

After Octavio Paz







What’s most human must drive

an arrow to the heart.

 

Ghosts, too, must abide by this directive

& remain transparent,

 

going about their business in old houses.

Before I was an I, I longed to be ethereal.

 

Sprouting wings at will & gliding through

cul-de-sacs and malls around the valley.

 

My hands, too, would gradually disappear

followed by my arms, then neck & head

 

until my whole body was slight as allergen.

Before I was an I, I spoke an old language

 

that would return on drowsy afternoons.

Therefore I struggled to say

 

the simplest sentences. So much so

that the maligned semicolon

 

became an ardent ally, an island

of pause and the deep breath.

 

The comma, too, bless its tiny soul,

was the crumb which the god

 

of small favors multiplied

tenfold for my morning pie.

 

Before I was an I, knowledge

clung to me like burrs & hunger

 

guided my ship like the barefoot light                on the sleeping land & sea.

The fearless blackbirds see me again

at the footpath beside the tall grasses

sprouting like unruly morning hair.

They caw and caw like vulgar boys

But this gang of birds is much too slick.

They are my homeys of the air

with their mousse-backed hair and Crayola

black coats like small fry hoods who smoke

and joke about each other’s mothers,

virginal sisters, and the sweet arc of revenge.

These birds spurn my uneaten celery sticks,

feckless gestures, ineffective hosannas.

They tag one another, shrill and terrible,

caroling each to each my weekly wages.

But they let me pass, then flit away.

They won’t mess with me this time—

But these, thy lovers are not dead.…They will rise up and hear your voice. . .. and run to kiss your mouth.


         –The Sphinx







In the garden of Père Lachaise,

city of the dead, we passed angels

covering their faces in shame,

& nineteenth-century trees, with tops bowed

as if their only purpose was to grieve,

& crossed the Transversales to Wilde’s grave.

 

When lovers leave, they leave their kisses

glistening on the gray slab,

on impressions of lips themselves,

a tissue of strangers’ cells

the conservators cannot leave alone,

& scrub the graffiti, as the plaque decrees

by law, no one can deface this tomb,

& still the images of lips remain,

dark gray stains of animal fat

imprisoned in limestone.

 

Lips are pressed as high as lovers

climb, against the Sphinx’s ridiculous

headdress, on the carved trumpet

of fame, & on the cheeks of its voracious face

of mindless passion flying with eyes pinched tight,

that some farsighted lover tried to open

with lines from a red pen, like a blepharoplasty,

while others kissed its sybaritic mouth

to make a poem a prophecy.

 

So here is love alive

surviving the wreckage it survives,

a lipstick envelope of hearts on their flight

to some other place, less aware,

more receiving, a final Champ de Grâce.

This is the poem of death.

There is only one

and no other.

 

Every one is an occasion,

one way or another,

and the last poem is this poem of death.

 

It is an occasion like no other.

I will no longer lope after elegance,

beauty’s body, or love’s wonder.

 

I will be sorry for everything

I was, and for everything I was not.

I speak to you as if you were my brother.

 

I will forgive everyone.

Death will make this possible.

There will be no other.

 

Death was in the mind

before thought or love,

in ourselves, and in our lovers.

 

The poem of death is speechless.

A companion will appear again

like another self, like your brother.

 

Enough now, enough has been said.

The spinning leaf will spin

like no other.

Nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel,

or what life itself eventually reveals.

 

No more studies of kindness or courtesy,

nor grace or charity, all is needless now.

 

All is needless now, sky, world, family

grieving for their bundles of purity,

 

now beyond disgrace, failure, winter streets,

or whatever attacks, and then retreats.

 

Classrooms emptied of children’s things,

paper and paste, and love’s imaginings,

 

bundles of peace, Christmas-blessed

with the unborn and the dead at rest,

 

nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel

or what life itself eventually reveals.

Among physicians rich in their death watch

In hallways crowded with locked wheelchairs,

Cradles of a century’s platitudes,

The stale air smelling of disinfectant

And weeping wounds enough to stupefy nurses,

Among the staring insomniacs of the day room,

The stroke victims on their rented gurneys,

Complaining orderlies and rattling carts

 

Among these in this place my father lay

At the end of everything

 

In the curved landscapes of white sheets

Abandoned finally by parents, his son,

 

The loyal company, old friends, his death

A sign of other deaths too soon to come

 

Unable to recall one life, his thoughts,

Features, he lay unknown to himself,

 

The tall hunter of pheasants out with his boy

In vellum corn and brassy orchards

 

In an autumn that never was, the proud

White-collared Ford employee lay on a bed

 

Too short for legs tattooed with red burn-rings

From daily syringes of Cytosar

 

Considered useless, still a requirement

For state funding for a body described

 

Leukemic waiting for Saturday's fiddlers

Who came to raise the spirits of the dead

 

With a music he never cared for turned

Suddenly attractive, he found genius,

 

Theirs or his like some lyrical phosphor

That shapes itself in the dry night air

 

To make a thing then make it disappear

He lay listening to the county fiddlers

 

At the end of every purpose, act and form

I leave you here, my father, in perfect accord.

Imagine half your face

rubbed out yet

you are suited up

and walking

to the office.

 

How will your mates

greet you?

with heavy hearts,

flowers,

rosary beads?

How shall we greet

the orphan boy,

the husband whose hand

slipped, children

and wife swept away?

 

How to greet

our new years

and our birthdays?

Shall we always

light a candle?

 

Do we remember

that time erases

the shore, grass

grows, pain’s

modified?

 

At Hikkaduwa

in 1980 I wrote a ditty,

a sailor’s song

about rain

in sunny Ceylon.

 

I don’t know

what Calypsonians

would compose

about this monstrous

wave, this blind hatchet man;

 

don’t know

the Baila singers’ reply;

we are a “happy and

go” people

yet the fisherman’s wife

 

knows

that her grandfather

was eaten by the ocean—

fisher communities

have suffered in time

 

and what’s happened

now is just another feast

for that bloody,

sleeping mother

lapping at our island;

 

but what if the ocean

were innocent,

the tectonic plates

innocent, what if God

were innocent?

 

               *

 

I do not know

how to walk upon the beach,

how to lift corpse

after corpse

until I am exhausted,

 

how to stop the tears

when half my face

has been rubbed out

beyond

the railroad tracks

 

and this anaesthetic,

this calypso come

to the last verse.

What shall we write

in the sand?

 

Where are gravestones

incinerated? Whose

ashes are these urned

and floating through a house

throttled by water?

 

Shall we build

a memorial

some calculated distance

from the sea, in a park,

in the shape of a giant wave

 

where we can write

the names of the dead?

Has the wave lost

its beauty? Is it now

considered obscene?

 

               *

 

Yet tomorrow

we must go to the ocean

and refresh ourselves

in the sea breeze

down in Hikkaduwa

 

where it is raining

in sunny Ceylon.

Tomorrow, we must

renew our vows

at sunrise, at sunset.

 

Let us say the next time

the ocean recedes

and parrots gawk

and flee, and restless

dogs insist their humans

 

wake up, we will not peer

at the revelation

of the ocean bed,

nor seek photographs.

We will run to higher ground,

 

and gathered there

with our children,

our cats, dogs,

pigs, with what we’ve

carried in our hands

 

—albums, letters—

we will make a circle,

kneel, sit,

stand in no particular

direction, pray

 

and be silent,

open our lungs

and shout thanks

to our gods

thanks to our dogs.

Kissing your lips

I try to forget roses

or the fruit of palmyra trees

sweet and strong

 

Tongue lolling upon tongue

heart beating

against heart beating,

signifying our human bodies

which poetry does not capture,

the absolute desire I have

to kiss your lips

on this hot and sunny afternoon.

 

I do not know how much longer

I can walk about the garden

kissing roses,

 

or perambulate the toddy tavern of my dreams

where black faces and white toddy mix

in black and white memories

of Jaffna, Sri Lanka,

my Tamil countrymen

far away on an island across the sea.

 

Far away and far away

the palmyra fruit and your lips.

To drink toddy now.

To kiss your rosy lips now.

To uproot the roses in my garden

and offer them upon my tongue now.

 

To fly to Sri Lanka

and grab the last fruit on the tree

before history throws the Tamils into the sea

as is said it will do;

 

before all this and everything else,

before the apocalypse,

I do so sincerely wish,

though my words may not fit,

to rest my head in your hair

and kiss your lips.

The first story I ever write

is a bright crayon picture

of a dancing tree, the branches

tossed by island wind.

I draw myself standing beside the tree,

with a colorful parrot soaring above me,

and a magical turtle clasped in my hand,

and two yellow wings fluttering

on the proud shoulders of my ruffled

Cuban rumba dancer's

fancy dress.

In my California kindergarten class,

the teacher scolds me: REAL TREES

DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT.

It's the moment

when I first

begin to learn

that teachers

can be wrong.

They have never seen

the dancing plants

of Cuba.

Two sets

of family stories,

one long and detailed,

about many centuries

of island ancestors, all living

on the same tropical farm...

The other side of the family tells stories

that are brief and vague, about violence

in the Ukraine, which Dad's parents

had to flee forever, leaving all their

loved ones

behind.

They don't even know if anyone

survived.

When Mami tells her flowery tales of Cuba,

she fills the twining words with relatives.

But when I ask my

Ukrainian-Jewish-American grandma

about her childhood in a village

near snowy Kiev,

all she reveals is a single

memory

of ice-skating

on a frozen pond.

Apparently, the length

of a grown-up's

growing-up story

is determined

by the difference

between immigration

and escape.

Mad has decided to catch a vulture,

the biggest bird she can find.

 

She is so determined, and so inventive,

that by stringing together a rickety trap

of ropes and sticks, she creates

a puzzling structure that just might

be clever enough to trick a buzzard,

once the trap’s baited with leftover pork

from supper.

 

Mad and I used to do everything together,

but now I need a project all my own,

so I roam the green fields,

finding bones.

 

The skull of a wild boar.

The jawbone of a mule.

 

Older cousins show me

how to shake the mule’s quijada,

to make the blunt teeth

rattle.

 

Guitars.

Drums.

Gourds.

Sticks.

 

A cow bell.

A washboard.

Pretty soon, we have

a whole orchestra.

 

On Cuban farms, even death

can turn into

music.

Newsmen call it the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Teachers say it's the end of the world.

At school, they instruct us to look up

and watch the Cuban-cursed sky.

Search for a streak of light.

Listen for a piercing shriek,

the whistle that will warn us

as poisonous A-bombs

zoom close.

Hide under a desk.

Pretend that furniture is enough

to protect us against perilous flames.

Radiation. Contamination. Toxic breath.

Each air-raid drill is sheer terror,

but some of the city kids giggle.

They don't believe that death

is real.

They've never touched a bullet,

or seen a vulture, or made music

by shaking

the jawbone

of a mule.

When I hide under my frail school desk,

my heart grows as rough and brittle

as the slab of wood

that fails to protect me

I have come to realize the body is its own pyre, that degree

rises from within, the fatty acids a kind of kindling.

Like a scientist in a lab, this much I have established, blood jelled

like gasoline, the years spread before me like a map

pinned with targets, where I’m raging even now.

It works both ways. Clear the forests to see your enemies

and your enemies see you clearly. Like all effective incendiaries,

I won’t only bloom where I’m planted.

And both the girls cried bitterly (though they hardly knew why) and clung to the Lion and kissed his mane and his nose and his paws and his great, sad eyes. Then he turned from them and walked out onto the top of the hill. And Lucy and Susan, crouching in the bushes, looked after him and this is what they saw.

—C. S. Lewis, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe







Tonight we will function like women.

The snow has gone away, the ice with its amniotic glare.

I clasp my sister’s tiny hand.

We will not turn away

Though spring, spring with its black appetite,

Comes seeping out of the earth.

 

The lion was sad. He suffered us

To touch him. When I placed the bread of my hands

In his mammalian heat, I was reminded

That the world outside this world

Is all vinegar and gall, that to be a young girl at the foot of a god

Requires patience. Timing.

 

The White Witch has mustered her partisans.

Because I am fascinated by her bracelets strung with baby teeth,

I will remember her as the woman

Who grins with her wrists. From my thicket of heather

I note that in her own congenital way

She is pure, that tonight she ushers something new into the world.

 

I cannot stop it. I cannot stop it just as in that other place

I could not keep the planes with their spiked fires from coming.

Though in this closed realm the smell of camphor is overwhelming

I have nothing but my hands to use

In ministering to the dead. Here too

My hands must suffice.

 

Hush now while I testify. They are shaving him.

The corona of his mane falls away

Like pieces of money. In the moon’s milk light

Her bangled wrists grin as she raises the blade.

Something is diffused. In whatever world he comes again

There will be women like us who choose to.

Somebody says draw a map. Populate it with the incidents

of your childhood. Mark the spot where the lake receded

after a winter of light snow. The stairs on which someone

slapped you. The place where the family dog hung itself

by jumping over the back fence while still on the dog run,

hours later its body like a limp flag on a windless day.

Draw a map, someone says. Let yourself remember.

In the refugee camp a hundred thousand strong

draw the stony outcrop from which you could no longer see

the plume of smoke that was your village. Draw a square

for the bathroom stall where Grandpa hid each day

in order to eat his one egg free from the starving eyes

of his classmates, an X for the courthouse where you and he

were naturalized, a broken line for the journey. Draw a map,

Jon says. Let it be your way into the poem. Here is where

that plane filled with babies crashed that I was not on.

Here is where I was ashamed. On the second floor

at Pranash University the people wait their turn. Have you

drawn your map, Jon asks. He has rolled up his sleeves.

Forty-five minutes to noon the Prince stands up and says

that the monks must be excused. We watch them file out,

saffron robes as if their bodies have burst into blossom.

Draw a map. Fly halfway around the globe. Here is the room

next to the library where you realize how poor your tradition is,

the local people with poetic forms still in use that date back

to the time of Christ. Tell us about your map. Explain

how these wavy lines represent the river, this rectangle

the school-turned-prison where only seven

escaped with their lives. This is my map. This star the place

where I sat in a roomful of people among whom not one

was not touched by genocide. Every last map resplendent with death

though nobody knows where their loved ones lie buried.

How many times can I appropriate a story that is not mine to tell?

The woman stands up and says she is not a poet, that she

doesn’t have the words. She points to a triangle on a piece of paper.

Here is the spot where she found human bones in the well

of her childhood home, and how her mother told herdon’t be afraid because it was not the work of wild animals.

Listen closely as I sing this. The man standing at the gate

tottering on his remaining limb is a kind of metronome, his one

leg planted firmly on the earth. Yes, I have made him beautiful

 

because I aim to lay all my cards on the table. In the book review

the critic writes, “Barry seeks not to judge but to understand.”

Did she want us to let her be, or does she want

 

to be there walking the grounds of the old prison on the hill

of the poison tree where comparatively a paltry twenty thousand

died? In the first room with the blown up

 

black-and-white of a human body gone abstract someone has

to turn and face the wall not because of the human pain

represented in the photo but because of her calmness,

 

the tranquility with which she tells us that her father

and her sister and her brother were killed. In graduate school

a whole workshop devoted to an image of a woman with bleach

 

thrown in the face and the question of whether or not

the author could write, “The full moon sat in the window

like a calcified eye, the woman’s face aglow with a knowingness.”

 

I felt it come over me and I couldn’t stop. I tried to pull myself

together and I couldn’t. They were children. An army of child

soldiers. In the room papered with photos of the Khmer Rouge

 

picture after picture of teenagers, children whose parents

were killed so that they would be left alone in the world

to do the grisly work that precedes paradise.

 

And the photos of the victims, the woman holding her newborn

in her arms as her head is positioned in a vise, in this case

the vise an instrument not of torture

 

but of documentation, the head held still as the camera captures

the image, the thing linking all their faces, the abject fear

and total hopelessness as exists

 

in only a handful of places in the history of the visible world.

For three $US per person she will guide you through what was

Tuol Sleng prison, hill of the strychnine tree.

 

Without any affectation she will tell you the story of how

her father and her sister and her brother went among

the two million dead. There are seventy-four forms

 

of poetry in this country and each one is still meant to be sung.

Say, when we woke those icy spring mornings they were still there.

The upper portion of their faces long ruined but you could still see

                                        the meaning in their hands,

 

palms once covered in gold. We knew better than to call them

by their names, Light that Shines Throughout the Universe

                         and His consort, but there were stories

 

of  travelers lost  in the foothills of  the Hindu  Kush and a distant

brilliance that led them home. The way a candle physically enters

                                        your body after it has been

 

snuffed out. The pearly smoke suffused in the air. In one school

hundreds  of  miles  away  all  the   girls  my age  were  poisoned,

                              and last week outside the capital

 

a woman like my  sister was shot dead  in front of a crowd by two men

who forced their bodies into her body and then judged her an infidel

                                        so they could kill her

 

and be done with it.  After the  visitors were blasted I had a dream.

I saw a human man standing by a lake and no one was looking at him

                                          directly. His image

 

on the surface of the water cleaner than anything in this world.

In   my   dream  the  man   said,  “Thousands   of  lifetimes  ago

                                        when my body was cut

 

into pieces by an evil king, I was not caught up in the idea of the self.”

Then  in  my   dream  someone   picked  up  a rock  and  I  woke  up.

                              It took almost a month,

 

the  great  heads  drilled with holes,  then anti-aircraft  tanks rolled in.

Each hundred-foot niche now empty but each cavity left shaped like us,

                              like a person. Before it happened

 

we talked about it. Grandfather said don’t they have a share in heaven?

Second Aunt said it was more realistic this way. God not in heaven

                                        but in exile.

what   is   this  light  I   hold

so   dear  it  wants   to move

imperceptibly    across   the

floor    as   the   earth   turns

so     as   not     to      become

 

too       aware      of      itself?

Nowhere    in   the     Halakha’s     five   thousand   years   of   rules 

does   it     specifically    state    Thou     shall     not     [                      ]

but     sometimes    tradition    carries    more     weight    than    law

 

and   so   for    much   of   the    past    year   we    have   not    talked

about     what    will    happen    on     Thursday,    how   the    cervix

will     start     its     slow    yawn,     the     pelvic      floor     straining

 

as         the           head        crowns,      the      fontanelles     allowing

the       bony        panes       of       the      skull     to      pass    through

until,     over    the   next    24   months,    the   five   cranial   plates

 

gradually      ossify,     the      head      forming    its     own    helmet

as     structures     harden    over   the    soft    meats   of  the  brain,

nor     do   we    talk   about    the   colostrum  sunny  as egg   yolks

 

now   collecting  in   your   breasts,   the    thing’s   first   nutrients

already    ready    and    waiting,    the     event    just    days   away

and   still  we  do  not  talk  about it, the mass growing inside you

 

tucked    up    safe     in   the     leeward   side    under    the   heart

because   sometimes   our   god   is   a  jealous god,   the evil   eye

lidless    and    all-seeing.  Instead  we  will wait  until  it is  done,

 

until  the  creature  has been  cleaned and wrapped in soft cloth,

the    bloody     cord   that    binds    you    severed.    And   maybe

you       will      name      it      Dolores,      which       means     grief,

 

or perhaps you will call it Mara, the Hebrew name for bitterness

because       this      is      how     we      protect     what     we    love,

by   hiding   what  it   truly  means  to   us,  the little  bag  of  gold

 

we    keep   buried   in  the  yard,   the  thing  we will do anything

to      keep      safe,      even    going     so      far    as    to     pretend

it    doesn’t    exist,   that   there’s   nothing  massing in  the  dark

 

despite  the steady  light  emanating  from  your  face, a radiance

so bright sometimes I can’t look at you, the joy so  overpowering

you     want    to     shout   it     from   the    highest    mountaintop

 

straight into God’s ear.

One day we will all be like this—the boat’s sickening pitch, & the delicateness

     needless, consumable.

 

How everything here naturally passes into night, a room

     w/o walls.

 

Could mindlessness keep us alive? Could bright colors?

 

Tonight I am thinking of the young woman who dreams of her father

     being shot in the head. Imagine needing to believe the one you love

     has been destroyed.

 

Now it is after midnight—the spindrift lunar & diaphanous. Here alone on deck

     could I make peace w/it all in thirty seconds—the water’s inherent rising, the gasping

     for air?

 

I have never seen such omnipresence, such vast dreamlessness—  

     but I too am such things.

 

What does it mean to be eroded? What would be the significance of slipping one leg

     over the rail & straddling the indifference?

 

Yes. Once upon a time we spent three days on a boat out of Kobé, Japan.

 

All night the waves. All night the somnambulistic urges.

 

Or how as children we would swim in a hard rain—the lake’s surface ragged & torn,

     but underneath

 

the roots of the water lilies like ladders

     trailing down into the marvelous.

 

",1
"

Shagged-gold, at rest the great haunches

as if axled, fur sleeked like a butter rug.

In the Serengeti sun, the male’s harem

 

like a solar system, each lady kept

exclusive, her seasonal heat for him alone,

estrous belly pressed to the ground,

 

then the male’s riding her musculature—

throughout evolution the cat’s barbed penis

nicking his breached mate as he dismounts.

 

See the deliberate walk, cool as a criminal,

the multi-jointed forepaws placed consciously

even by the usurped king, his eye teeth blacked,

 

his tail rotted off, tired wag of a bloody stump

as he finally falls dying, the crucified face bedded

in its wheel of hair, the tawny miscegenated eyes

 

binocular in breadth. Shark in the long grasses.

Shark in the long grass. Smell everywhere, the gazelle

with its small-headed splendor gracing the plains

 

is ambushed, devoured, its horned bone rack

souvenired, the murderer’s ripping muzzle crimsoned.

In the despot’s sons’ palace of pure gold

 

the three in the iron cage lazing like statues.

When the American unlocks the hinged door

our shackled hearts contract. Unhooded and naked

 

we are pushed into their presence,

and for a shining moment the animals study us,

these fabulous aliens.

 

Here in a desert captivity

snatched from the baobab’s sour fruit,

their swagged bellies shifted, broken, and resignedly

 

the ancient drive rose up only in one—

its head wreathed beyond sorrow

as it slouched out of the habitual darkness,

 

the permanent rictus of its terrible mouth

pain-struck. The thing came toward me

with its ruined light, and I saw affliction in it.

 

Dream of mastery. Dream of being wholly consumed,

freed. I am the lion and the lion is me.

Then the American pulls us out.

 

",1
"

Literally the thing has been gutted, a ragged gash

carved under its tail to midway up its chest, eyes

like stagnant water, horns intricate as a woodwind.

Where did the viscera go? Where do the viscera ever go?

I am in a car driving to the northernmost point

on this spit. Porte de Mort. Death’s Northern Door.

Literally where my grandmother lives. Her 89-year-old cousin

has just fallen out a window but is all right, the bruises

 

like stained glass. Enthusiasm. To be in God.

My grandmother says it is proof, and I nod my head

because I too would like to live in such a world

where an eighty-nine year old crawls out a window

and falls seven feet to the ground, in turn the miracle

of her body stained a deep blue, vitreous. In one room

of the unfinished mansion where we will celebrate the day,

the ninety-year-old matriarch sleeps in her four-poster bed

 

under the canopy of a wedding dress, its hundred eyelets

a fallacy. After dinner someone will hand around an indulgence

of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, the lady’s dark cheek

marred as if she has been scratched. Who at this table

fled the police? Who left that place in flames, the rubble

of infinite hearths? The deer’s eyes like perfect cataracts,

the evidence cooling. When I think of my room in the earth,

I can’t breathe. A friend of a friend recently hit a small bear

 

with his car. At the end of my favorite novel a bear

is dancing on a makeshift stage, the bear a grotesquerie

like the rest of us. No one stopped to help,

said my friend. Traffic barely slowed. I do not judge this,

 

or even the surreptitious footage of the workers

somewhere on the killing floor, stomping

the breast-heavy creatures with their rubber boots.

How we raise them not to fly, what should waft

 

gnostically through the air, the hollowness of evolving.

My heart is doing that thing again, saying climb the stairs

on your knees. I tell a friend a man halfway across the world

has been killed, torn apart by motorbikes, each limb

tied in a different direction. Could a universe be born this way?

One minute you are scarping the silvery bark off a birch

when it comes to you forever and there you lie

in the bed of a blood-smeared truck at a stoplight

 

on Highway 41 because this is the season of messages.

The man was a teacher. He taught girls.

When they came for him he told his children

not to cry. Then the men took out half his bowel,

the viscera steaming as they do, and they tied him

ingeniously in such a way that they tore him apart.

In that other place three million of us died. When I left,

I left them all behind. In the unfinished mansion

 

someone will ask me what I’m thankful for.

What to say? That one of the most beautiful things

I have ever seen was a paper nest secreted by wasps,

and that in the summer I would sleep under it,

the runnelled mass turning like a planet in the moonlight?

I will admit I was in favor of war and now look what’s happened.

At the end of the road the man driving the truck will eat

the deer. If I had to watch someone be torn apart by motorbikes

 

I would still be me, which is the horror of it all.

I am ten.

My mother sits in a black

rocking chair in the parlor

and tells stories of a country school

surrounded by ricefields

and no roads.

 

I stand in the kerosene light

behind her,

earning my allowance.

A penny

for each white hair I pull.

—for James I. Ina

The emotion of trucks, buses & troop trains

brings them here,

to the wrong side of another state.

A woman at the Klamath Falls depot

calls it the wrong side of the ocean.

Crumbs hide around the table legs

in the mess hall,

dishes & silverware

clink a strange song.

Families talk across long tables.

Questions drop like puzzles

to the unfinished floor.

Blocks away from their new home

a woman finds a latrine

not backed up. Stands

in line, waiting her turn

in the wind. Down

the center of the open room:

12 toilet stools, six pair,

back to back. Sits down

and asks for privacy,

holding a towel in front of her

with trembling hands.

In a North Dakota prisoner-of-war camp,

surrounded by Germans & Italians,

a quiet man

hammers a samurai sword from scrap metal

at night in a boiler room.

A secret edge

to hold against the dark mornings.

 

He sends love notes to his pregnant wife

in Tule Lake

sewn in pants

mailed home for mending.

His censored letters

mention a torn pocket.

She finds the paper near the rip,

folded & secret in the lining.

 

White voices

claim the other side of the ocean

is so crowded

the people want to find death

across the phantom river.

Headlines shake their nervous words.

Out on the coast

beach birds print their calligraphy

in the sand.

It is such a small country.

—displayed in the Weaverville Museum







It is the picture of a man who dreams

at night, his dreams a cartoon color

he can’t forget in his blue cell:

a fork chases a hard-boiled egg

across the smooth paper,

cheered on by an angry alarm clock.

The clock rings

and the artist knows it is morning

even though the iron cell

is in a basement with no windows.

 

In the center of the painting

the devil blows a whistle

and his pitchfork drips blood.

Above in the night

a man has taken off in a Buck Rogers spaceship

heading for a yellow one-eyed moon.

He grips the steering wheel in the open cockpit

and doesn’t look back.

 

In a lower corner

under a naked tree

a satyr sits and plays his pan-flute.

The notes weave all around the painting,

twist around a girl

dancing in veils.

 

The man who dreams all this

pulls at his covers,

drowses at the bottom of the painting.

 

The man who painted this

died in his dreams.

—after Frank O’Hara







You have been smiling across the table at your date

with a sesame seed stuck in your teeth.

 

You will gain sophistication, become accepted by Reader’s Digest, and retire in Puyallup.

 

In your next life you will be a teacher

and no one will ever call you by your first name.

 

After your next vacation you will come home

and discover that your neighbors have redecorated

in the style of Iowa trailer court.

 

If you feel like you’re getting old,

secretly plant zucchini in your neighbor’s flowerbeds.

 

Avoid people who iron their sheets

or roll their socks & underwear.

 

Painting and poetry and music will show us where we should

be going, not the senate or tv news.

 

The next thermos bottle you see will actually

be a listening device made in Korea.

 

All the people in this restaurant

are glad that they are not you.

The sky wants the water to turn grey,

but if I notice how waves

 

play with the clumps of yellow flags,

or the way turtles share logs,

 

or even try to understand a friend’s decision

to walk onto a glacier

 

and end her life—I will be ready

for any poems that have been waiting.

 

The horizon opens as I walk,

escorted by swans and Canada geese.

 

I need to stop backpedaling into the present.

In my old life people would straighten

 

the truth, but the river

flows in curves.

 

The names of my father and my mother

rest next to each other in Greenwood Cemetery.

 

The distance between me and the mountains

measures an uneven thought: I feel like an orphan.

 

An early moon is just a piece of change

in the softening sky.

 

Light is such an actress. Time to seek

Hopper’s wish to simply paint sunlight

 

on the wooden wall of a house. I am growing

older. Maru in Japanese means

 

the ship

will make it back home.

 

",1
"

No, I am not deformed.

I wear these socks

Because I haven't any gloves,

And my fingers are bitten with frost.

They feel like stumps.

Luckily, I finished covering

The citrus tree with sheets of burlap.

Before darkness,

I will light a smudge pot

Near the mummified trunk,

Then anoint my hands in a blue salve.

Yesterday was cold

But the freeze is on now.

I must remind myself

Not to lick any cars.

Mr. Nishizawa, a house over,

Told me his nephew

Lost a fourth of his tongue

For that reason. Years ago,

The rosebushes were ruined to a freeze

And have never come back.

If needed, I will stay up all night

And pray, will let the hoarfrost

Burn in my chest. My grandfather

Ate the yield from this tree

After he died. I saw him.

That boy, the champion breath holder,

Kenji Takezo, lost his title

This year to Mack Stanton

A retired truck driver

New to the area.

Held in the town swimming pool

Thirty-five participants inhaled

Deeply all at once

Submerged the depth.

The contest went on into twilight.

One by one each person

Came up sucking air.

Kenji was the town favorite.

We wanted him to win again.

He trained so hard,

It was the only real talent

He had

Other than surfing and making

Trouble. When he surfaced

Second to last

Gulping the night

Then vomiting water,

We were disappointed.

He was doing so well.

He had his lucky twenty-pound brick

Cradled in his lap.

It kept him down.

But that trucker Mack was too good.

He read

Comic books, aloud, underwater.

We watched from the bleachers

His laughter bursting above him.

Kenji saw this too.

He never had anybody

Read to him

Not even his mother,

And he wanted to hear

What was being read

What his opponent found so funny.

 

",1
"

After Kenji Takezo fell from a wave,

The turbulence of whitewash confused

His sense of direction.

He breathed in

When he should have

 

Held tight. By accident, he swallowed

The Pacific. The water poured down his throat,

A blue cascade he could not see.

He felt in his stomach

The heavy life of the ocean.

 

It wasn’t funny, but he giggled

When a school of fish tickled his ribs.

He went home, the surf not rideable,

It was no longer there,

The water weighted in his belly.

 

That night, while he slept, the tide moved.

The long arms of the moon

Reached inside him pulling the Pacific free.

When he woke the next morning,

He lay in a puddle of ocean that was his.

Steel horses nodding

In the petroleum field are beasts

That suck

The crude of earth.

They have lived here for as long as I

Remember. This moment,

 

I smell wild incense:

Heather, abducted by a desert wind.

Its growth hides

The rain-carved ribs of the foothills.

Evening swallows

The city fasting on late fall.

 

Years ago, after hearing the story

About a boy who lost

Both legs while playing on an oil pump,

I was dared to straddle one.

All my friends were there to watch

The Pacific behind me burning with dusk.

 

The brute lifted me to the sky,

Where I merged with the twilight,

A warm breeze embracing my back.

None of them noticed

The world stopped to breathe.

When I looked, they disappeared.

 

Nearby in pink-flowered bushes

Someone found

The girl who’d been missing for weeks.

They stood in awe, the body

Decomposing, while I rode

The slow bucking animal.

 

Two months later, off the same pump,

A man dove,

An imperfect swan into night.

He landed in the dirt gully

Breaking the soft, white wings

He never had.

 

Today, I catch in my hand

An insect charged with lightning.

It tickles

The obscure scoop of my palm

As I hold it to my mouth and explain

A wish so simple

 

By morning I will have forgotten it.

I release

The bug to a desert wind

That is racing toward the sea,

A brutal dryness in its wake.

Fire in the hills everywhere.

About the only thing I thought I knew

was that nothing I’d ever know would do

any good. Sunrise, say, or that the part

of the horse’s hoof that most resembles

a human palm is called the frog;

certain chords on the guitar of no mercantile use;

the abstruse circuitry of an envelope

quatrain; even the meaning of horripilation.

 

Sometimes on a flatland mound the ancients had made,

I took heart in the pointlessness of stars

and lay there until my teeth chattered.

I earned my last Boy Scout merit badge

building a birdhouse out of license plates

manufactured by felons in the big house.

No more paramilitary organizations for me,

I said, ten years before I was drafted.

 

I had skills. Sure-footedness and slick

fielding. Eventually I would learn to unhook

a bra one-handed, practicing on my friend,

his sister's worn over his T-shirt (I took

my turns too). One Easter Sunday I hid

through the church service among the pipes

of the organ and still did not have faith,

although my ears rang until Monday.

 

I began to know that little worth knowing

was knowable and faith was delusion.

I began to believe I believed in believing

nothing I was supposed to believe in,

except the stars, which, like me,

were not significant, except for their light,

meaning I loved them for their pointlessness.

I believed I owned them somehow.

 

A C major 7th chord was beautiful and almost rare.

The horse I loved foundered and had to be

put down. The middle rhyme in an envelope

quatrain was not imprisoned if it was right.

In cold air a nipple horripilates

and rises, the sun comes up and up and up,

a star that bakes the eggs

in a Boy Scout license plate birdhouse.

 

God was in music and music was God.

A drill sergeant seized me by my dog tag

chain and threatened to beat me

to a pile of bloody guts for the peace sign

I’d chiseled in the first of my two tags,

the one he said they’d leave in my mouth

before they zipped the body bag closed.

Yet one more thing I’d come to know.

 

He also said that Uncle Sam owned my ass,

no more true than my ownership

of the stars. I can play a C major 7th chord

in five or six places on the neck of a guitar.

A stabled horse’s frog degrades; a wild horse’s

becomes a callus, smooth as leather.

Stars are invisible in rainy weather,

something any fool knows, of course.

The first space shuttle launch got delayed until

Sunday, so we had to watch the shuttle’s return

to Earth in class instead—PS113’s paunchy black

& white rolled in, the antennae on top adjusted

sideways & down for better reception. That same

day, Garrett stole my new pencil box. That same

day, Cynthia peed her jeans instead of going

to the bathroom & letting Garrett steal her pencil

box. Both of us too upset to answer questions about

space flight, so we got sent to the back of the class.

I smelled like the kind of shame that starts a fight

on a Tuesday afternoon. Cynthia smelled like pee

& everyday Jordache. The shuttle made its slick way

back to Earth, peeling clouds from the monochromatic

sky & we all—even the astronomically marginal—

were winners. American, because a few days before,

a failed songwriter put a bullet in the president

in the name of Jodie Foster. The shuttle looked

like a bullet, only with wings & a cockpit, & when

it finally landed, the class broke into applause

& the teacher snatched a thinning American flag

from the corner, waved it back & forth in honor

of our wounded president & those astronauts.

blacks painted onto bricks & split vinyl on the East Side,

jaws as tight as window locks with the curtains drawn

& behind that diligent fabric: blacks already tucked

into homemade forts—folding chairs, wobbly backbones

& the whole, snowy world waiting outside like ghost

stories whispered around the last sputtering match. & later,

top sheets pulled up over heads from fear of mirrors

at midnight or some backfired beater’s rusty pop pop pop

after the key twists at the edge of the week. No doubt:

Tuesday is the scariest day in Section 8, but Friday is right

after it in the suburbs. & after those trembling weekdays,

even more blacks with money disappearing & reappearing

as unexpectedly as poltergeists inside of TVs & haunted

trees with fast fingers in West Side yards. & still not

a wavelength of any kind for a black to put in the bank.

The inks in everybody’s hatted & contracting checkbooks

don’t change black. Some front-row architecture might.

Some guns, too, & their loud, colorful opportunities:

whatever version of black is inside a fist around a grip.

Not a color, really—more like the face a man makes in

the glinting face of a gun pointed at him every single day.

This is the g-dropping vernacular

     I am stuck in. This is the polyphone

where my head is an agrarian gang

     sign pointing like a percussion mallet

to a corn maze in one of the smaller

     Indiana suburbs where there aren’t

supposed to be black folks. Be cool & try

     to grin it off. Be cool & try to lean

it off. Find a kind of black & bet on it.

     I’m grinning to this vernacular

like the big drum laugh tracks a patriotic

     marching band. Be cool & try to ride

the beat the same way me, Pryor,

     & Ra did driving across the 30th Street

Bridge, laughing at these two dudes

     with big afros like it’s 1981 peeing into

the water & looking at the stars. Right

     before Officer Friendly hit his lights.Face the car, fingers locked behind

     your heads. Right after the fireworks

started popping off. Do I need to call 

     the drug dog? Right after the rattling

windows, mosquitoes as busy in my ears

     as 4th of July traffic cops. Right before

the thrill of real planets & pretend planets

     spun high into the sky, Ra throwing up

three West Side fingers, each ringed

     by pyrotechnic glory & the misnomer

of the three of us grinning at the cop’s club

     down swinging at almost the exact same

time Pryor says, Cops put a hurting on your

     ass, man. & fireworks light up in the same

colors as angry knuckles if you don’t

     duck on the double. Especially on the West

Side—more carnivorous than almost any

     other part of Earth Voyager saw when

it snapped a blue picture on its way out

     of this violently Technicolor heliosphere.

Leaves scarcely breathing

in the black breeze;

the flickering swallow

draws circles in the dusk.

 

In my loving

dying heart

a twilight is coming,

a last ray, gently reproaching.

 

And over the evening forest

the bronze moon climbs to its place.

Why has the music stopped?

Why is there such silence?

The clock-cricket singing,

that’s the fever rustling.

The dry stove hissing,

who unmoored my boat.

 

Rain-mumble on the roof—

that’s the fire in black silk.

But even at the bottom of the sea

the bird-cherry will hear ‘good-bye’.

 

For death is innocent,

Let us praise the twilight of freedom, brothers,

the great year of twilight!

A thick forest of nets has been let down

into the seething waters of night.

O sun, judge, people, desolate

are the years into which you are rising!

                     

Let us praise the momentous burden

that the people’s leader assumes, in tears.

Let us praise the twilight burden of power,

its weight too great to be borne.

Time, whoever has a heart

will hear your ship going down.

 

We have roped swallows together

into legions.

Now we can’t see the sun.

Everywhere nature twitters as it moves.

In the deepening twilight the earth swims into the nets

and the sun can’t be seen.

 

But what can we lose if we try one

groaning, wide, ungainly sweep of the rudder?

The earth swims. Courage,

brothers, as the cleft sea falls back from our plow.

Even as we freeze in Lethe we’ll remember

the ten heavens the earth cost us.

mumbling predictions,

mouth dry with jealousy.

Parched tongue

thirsting, not even for the word—

again without you.

 

I’m not jealous any more

but I want you.

I carry myself like a victim

to the hangman.

I will not call you

either joy or love.

All my own blood is gone.

Something strange paces there now.

Another moment

and I will tell you:

it's not joy but torture

you give me.

I'm drawn to you

as to a crime—

to your ragged mouth,

to the soft bitten cherry.

Come back to me,

Never had you such power

Everything I desire

Whoever kisses time’s ancient nodding head

will remember later, like a loving son,

how the old man lay down to sleep

in the drift of wheat outside the window.

He who has opened the eyes of the age,

two large sleepy apples with inflamed lids,

hears forever after the roar of rivers

swollen with the wasted, lying times.

 

The age is a despot with two sleepy apples

to see with, and a splendid mouth of earth.

When he dies he’ll sink onto the numb

arm of his son, who’s already senile.

I know the breath growing weaker by the day

Not long not till the simple song

of the wrongs of earth is cut off,

and a tin seal put on the lips.

 

O life of earth! O dying age!

I’m afraid no one will understand you

but the man with the helpless smile

of one who has lost himself.

O the pain of peeling back the raw eyelids

to look for a lost word, and with lime

slaking in the veins, to hunt

for night herbs for a tribe of strangers!

 

The age. In the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime

is hardening. Moscow’s sleeping like a wooden coffin.

There’s no escaping the tyrant century.

After all these years the snow still smells of apples.

I want to run away from my own doorstep,

but where? Out in the street it’s dark,

and my conscience glitters ahead of me

like salt strewn on the pavement.

 

Somehow I’ve got myself set for a short journey

through the back lanes, past thatched eaves, starling houses,

an everyday passer-by, in a flimsy coat,

forever trying to button the lap-robe.

Street after street flashes past,

the frozen runners crunch like apples;

can’t get the button through the button-hole,

it keeps slipping out of my fingers.

 

The winter night thunders

like iron hardware through the Moscow streets.

Knocks like a frozen fish, or billows in steam,

flashing like a carp in a rosy tea-room.

Moscow is Moscow again. I say hello to her.

‘Don’t be stern with me; never mind.

I still respect the brotherhood

of the deep frost, and the pike’s justice.’

 

The pharmacy’s raspberry globe shines onto the snow.

Somewhere an Underwood typewriter’s rattled.

The sleigh-driver’s back, the snow knee-deep,

what more do you want? They won't touch you, won’t kill you.

Beautiful winter, and the goat sky

has crumbled into stars and is burning with milk.

And the lap-robe flaps and rings

like horse-hair against the frozen runners.

 

And the lanes smoked like kerosene stoves,

swallowed snow, raspberry, ice,

endlessly peeling, like a Soviet sonatina,

recalling nineteen-twenty.

The frost is smelling of apples again.

Could I ever betray to gossip-mongers

the great vow to the Fourth Estate

and oaths solemn enough for tears?

 

Who else will you kill? Who else will you worship?

What other lie will you dream up?

There’s the Underwood’s cartilage. Hurry, rip out a key,

you’ll find a little bone of a pike.

And in the sick son’s blood the deposit of lime

will melt, and there’ll be sudden blessèd laughter.

But the simple sonatina of typewriters

is only a faint shade of those great sonatas.

Our lives no longer feel ground under them.

At ten paces you can’t hear our words.

 

But whenever there’s a snatch of talk

it turns to the Kremlin mountaineer,

 

the ten thick worms his fingers,

his words like measures of weight,

 

the huge laughing cockroaches on his top lip,

the glitter of his boot-rims.

 

Ringed with a scum of chicken-necked bosses

he toys with the tributes of half-men.

 

One whistles, another meouws, a third snivels.

He pokes out his finger and he alone goes boom.

 

He forges decrees in a line like horseshoes,

One for the groin, one the forehead, temple, eye.

 

He rolls the executions on his tongue like berries.

He wishes he could hug them like big friends from home.

Many months have passed

since the diagnosis,

and you’re still grieving for her.

She’s not dead yet.

But she’s lost, like a child is lost—

her mind the ocean floor,

where she kicks up sand

and churns in the water.

 

Al, we call it, or AD—

never by its real name

as if mentioning the word would bring bad luck—

the need to cross one’s self across the heart,

throw back to the ocean half of one’s catch,

turn three times and pray to the East.

 

Papa’s and her letters,

written during their courtship,

are tied with a faded, red ribbon

and sunk in a safe deposit box at Bishop Trust.

Long ago, she gave them to you

for safekeeping. At the time

 

she exacted a promise from you,

that you would not read them

until she was dead.

We twist down the spiral staircase

curled like a strand of seaweed

into the cold room of vaults,

the heavy thud of door distinct as your sadness

following us everywhere. There,

you turn over the bundle of letters

in your hand like unbelievable money.

“I’m so tempted to read them,” you say.

 

You want her back,

the feisty and independent one,

the one who could, at eighty,

do ten knee bends in aerobics class,

dance a smooth jitterbug

and shuttle like the tide

to and from the house about her business.

Not this Elizabeth you mourn,

the one who can no longer reason,

who points and giggles at fat people

and smells, sometimes, like the ocean.

Time slides like Dali’s clock.

Elizabeth is surprised

that she once was married and had a husband,

that she once gave birth to sons.

 

",1
"

In her illness

Elizabeth believes we do this deliberately,

the washing of her body.

She blames me,

her Japanese daughter-in-law

for having made keeping her clean a fetish.

Angry, she says we do this to torment

her soul, the shower a hot

spray of needles we subject

on her moon-colored skin.

She hates it even more

if I’m there to wash her.

She wants her son,

the person she thinks of these days

as her lover, or husband, or father.

Memory and privacy,

she cries at their loss

as I soap her down like an old car.

What protestations!

And as I listen to her,

I think of these bodies

we have given so freely to men,

yet feel ashamed of

when in the eyes of another woman.

How she fawns

when she thinks a man’s around.

Today, she bangs the walls.

“I hate you! The water’s too wet!”

Hanging onto the safety bars,

she pitches back and forth

like a child,

wanting to be let out at the gate.

I wash her back.

She spins around

in my soap-lathered hands,

and loosening her face in mine,

she glares.

She sticks out her tongue,

and biting down on it, she squeals,

jowls swinging, arms jiggling.

Then, in a dive of both hands

between her legs,

she drops to a semi-squat, simian posture

and thrusts her pelvis bones forward

like mountains in an antediluvian upheaval.

In a gesture of obscenity,

she unfolds her petals

and displays her withered sex to me—

the same way boys moon, flip the bird

or grab their crotch and waggle their tongues—

the profane she feels but can’t articulate.

When I was three,

a tsunami hit town.

“Daddy, Daddy, save me,

don’t let me drown.”

He saved me

and my common-type dolls.

 

When I was sixteen,

another tsunami hit town.

I cried to my daddy,

“Daddy, Daddy, please save me,

don’t let me drown!”

But he let go of my hand!

 

I still dance

to what broke on my life.

My son lives on the streets.

We don’t see each other much.

Like a mother who puts white lilies

on the headstone of a dead child,

I put money into his bank account,

clothes into E-Z Access storage

and pretend he’s far away—

at a boarding school, or in a foreign country.

Nights, I dream fairy tales about him.

I dream he becomes a prince,

scholar or warrior who rescues me

from sorrow, the way he rescued me

when he was a child and said,

“Mommy, don’t cry,” and brought tea

into the room of his father’s acrimony—

brave, standing tall in the forest

fire of his father’s scorn. I wake

to the empty sound of wind in the trees.

He says he wants to live with me.

I say I can’t live with him—

boy whose words crash like branches in a rain storm.

Nothing can hold him in,

the walls of a house too thin.

Back home, I had seen

the “study-hard-so-you-don’t-become-like-them”

street bums on Mamo Street,

and he’s like them.

These days, in order to catch a glimpse of him,

I circle the city. One day,

I see him on his bike.

People give him wide berth,

the same way birds avoid power lines,

oncoming cars or trees.

I park on a side street.

Wild-eyed, he flies the block

as if in a holding pattern.

Not of my body, not of my hopes,

he homes in on what can’t be given or taken away.

In college, people were always breaking up.

We broke up in parking lots,

beside fountains.

Two people broke up

across a table from me

at the library.

I could not sit at that table again

though I did not know them.

I studied bees, who were able

to convey messages through dancing

and could find their ways

home to their hives

even if someone put up a blockade of sheets

and boards and wire.

Bees had radar in their wings and brains

that humans could barely understand.

I wrote a paper proclaiming

their brilliance and superiority

and revised it at a small café

featuring wooden hive-shaped honey-dippers

in silver honeypots

at every table.

We spend the afternoon together watching a docudrama about wild horses that roamed the ancient Arctic Circle. Surprisingly sleek, built for speed and not the weather, they were remarkable for their recklessness. They careen headlong down ice bluffs to fall into a broken heap. We can hear the small, tinny sounds of their terror as they plunge across vast, glowing glacial faces. All of this takes place alongside an abstractly relentless gunmetal sea. I can feel you turn to me, wetness marking the corners of your lips and eyes. I, too, am mesmerized, my vision limited to a sense of motion on the peripheries. Later, I am summoned for an impromptu scan and, miraculously, I pass.

My skin crawls at odd hours of the day, a residual effect of my recent radiation therapies, how they inadvertently synced me to coronal flares. During my morning tea, at the gym, during the drive back home. A simple turn transforms into an avalanching pinprick of tremors one millimeter thick. I’d have preferred a suppurative response—one that collects under the skin—to this invisible, blistering, cracklesome lightning scar. One can’t choose the mood that gathers, the body’s response.


 


The brightest moments of the day rarely correlate to a discharge. Gray sky or blackness, a foggy haze aswirl between stars and nothing halts. Some moments tear my teeth.


 


The news feed portends rolling blackouts across the state. I read over the last of my messages: A blanket request for a plasma donation, Sasha asking if I want a ride to the wake.

                                 How much chemical disorder

                 can be survived depends                on medical technology.

    A hundred years ago, cardiac arrest was irreversible.

                                       People were called dead

                when their heart                  stopped beating.

            Today death is                                  believed to occur 4

      to 6 minutes after                                      the heart stops beating

              because after                                     several minutes it is difficult

      to resuscitate the brain.

                                                    However, with new experimental

              treatments, more than         10 minutes of warm cardiac

                                      arrest can       now be survived without

      brain injury.     Future technologies

                                                          for molecular repair may extend the

 

 

                               frontiers of resuscitation beyond

Something I learned about agape when I was young: the Iliad tells

us fellow-feeling is finite in communities. Brotherly love becomes a

number that has to be divided among persons—so if you’re too kind to

others, that might explain your neighbor’s graft. I sometimes wonder if

perception is the same; if the quantity of percepts, or our trove of eidetic

things, is not limitless but rather constant: the measure, say, of a sunlit

field. So if we dip like deep-sea divers to the world, we’ll have to use a

purse-seine to sieve our sense impressions. We’re hoarding the image

at our peril. That bluest scilla smeared by a finger writing in the grass?

Endangered. Poetry’s work is not to ravish, but diminish.

I see my mother, at thirteen,

Monsoon season drying up—

steam lifting in full-bodied waves.

She chops bắp chuối for the hogs.

 

Her hair dips to the small of her back

She opened her mouth and a moose came out, a donkey, and an ox—out of her mouth, years of animal grief. I lead her to the bed. She held my hand and followed. She said, Chết rồi, and like that, the cord was cut, the thread snapped, and the cable that tied my mother to her mother broke. And now her eyes red as a market fish. And now, she dropped like laundry on the bed.


 


The furniture moved toward her, the kitchen knives and spoons, the vibrating spoons—they dragged the tablecloth, the corner tilting in, her mouth a sinkhole. She wanted all of it: the house and the car too, and the flowers she planted, narcissus and hoa mai, which cracked open each spring—the sky, she brought it low until the air was hot and wet and broke into a rain—


 


the torrents like iron ropes you could climb up, only I couldn’t. I was drowning in it. I was swirled in. I leapt into her mouth, her throat, her gut, and stayed inside with the remnants of my former life. I ate the food she ate and drank the milk she drank. I grew until I crowded the furnishings. I edged out her organs, her swollen heart. I grew up and out so large that I became a woman, wearing my mother’s skin.

Mid-October in Central Park, one of the elms

has changed early, burning with a light

grown accustomed to its own magnificence,

 

imperceptible until this moment when it becomes

more than itself, more than a ritual

of self-immolation. I think of sacrifice

 

as nourishment, the light feeding bark and veins

and blood and skin, the tree better off

for wanting nothing more. I used to imagine

 

the chakra like this—a hole in the soul

from the top of the head, where the light of knowing

can shimmer through. In the summer of 1979

 

I saw that light shoot from my brother’s forehead

as we sat chanting in a temple in Manila.

He didn’t see it pulsing like a bulb in a storm,

 

but he said he felt the warmth that wasn’t warmth

but peace. And I, who have never been

so privileged, since then have wondered

 

if we believed everything because not to believe

was to be unhappy. I’ve seen that light elsewhere

—on a river in Bangkok, or pixeled across

 

the shattered façades of Prague—but it is here

where I perceive its keenest rarity, where I know

it has passed over all the world, has given shape

 

to cities, cast glamour over the eyes of the skeptic,

so that it comes to me informed with the wonder

of many beings. I can’t begin to say how infinite I feel,

 

as though I were one of many a weightless absence

touches, and out of this a strange transformation:

the soul ringed with changes, as old as a tree,

 

as old as light. I am always learning the same thing:

there is no other way to live than this,

still, and grateful, and full of longing.

The dry basin of the moon must have held

the bones of a race, radiant minerals,

or something devoid of genesis, angel-heavy,

idea-pure. All summer we had waited for it,

 

our faces off-blue in front of the TV screen.

Nothing could be more ordinary—two figures

digging dirt in outer space—while mother repeated

Neil Armstrong’s words, like a prayer

 

electronically conveyed. The dunes were lit

like ancient silk, like clandestine pearl.

In the constant lunar night this luminescence

was all we hoped for. A creature unto itself,

 

it poured into the room like a gradual flood

of lightning, touching every object with the cool burn

of something not quite on fire. If we stepped out

Manila would be blank ether, way station,

 

a breathless abeyance. It didn’t matter,

at that moment, where our lives would lead:

father would disown one brother,

one sister was going to die. Not yet unhappy,

 

we were ready to walk on the moon. Reckless

in our need for the possible, we knew

there was no turning back, our bags already packed,

the future a religion we could believe in.

It takes just two people to bring the world

to ruin. So goes the history of love.

At the end of the day we tally the casualties

of war, victory for the one who gets wounded

 

the least. You say it’s time for a change

but I don’t know to what end, change being

just the skin of some incandescent creature

whose grotesque beauty is what we adore,

 

whom some people call love, whom we

venerate because it consumes us, slim pickings

for its huge soul. My people say, don’t look

or you’ll go blind. You say the end was always

 

just around the bend. I say all we have

is unconditional surrender to the future.

So unreliable is the past that I feel compelled

to leave unmourned the blind, relentless loves

 

that may have scorched into our hearts

the way the saints accepted stigmata. My people say,

look back or lose your way. Or, walk backwards,

if you can. So I found myself on a bus to New York City

 

to lose myself completely. Past Hunters Point

we hit the factory of souls—a thousand tombstones

from which a silk-like canopy of smoke rose to meet

God knows what—a spacious emptiness, the end.

 

I’ve heard the world’s never going to end.

I’ve heard it will go on and on, and we will be

as nebulous as Nebuchadnezzar, our live

not worth a footnote, our grandest schemes

 

no more than feeble whispers, all memory

shifting like the continental plates. In the future,

all science will finally come around; genetic

engineering, I’ve been told, will be all the rage,

 

and we will be a super race in a world

infallibly perfected, where trains run on time,

love never dies, and hope can be purchased

by the pound. It’s called immortalization

 of the cell lines. We will choose what will survive.

Our destiny made lucid, we will find the world

contemplating itself, like the young Narcissus,

one hand about to touch the pool, his body

 

lurched towards that marvelous reflection.

I suppose we’ve always felt compelled

to desensitize our failures. My people say,

to go unnoticed, you play dead. I myself

 

may have chosen to forget a face, a name,

some cruel word uttered carelessly, but not,

after all the harm is done, intending any pain.

And many others may have chosen to forget me.

You are running away from everyone

who loves you,

from your family,

from old lovers, from friends.

 

They run after you with accumulations

of a former life, copper earrings,

plates of noodles, banners

of many lost revolutions.

 

You love to say the trees are naked now

because it never happens

in your country. This is a mystery

from which you will never

 

recover. And yes, the trees are naked now,

everything that still breathes in them

lies silent and stark

and waiting. You love October most

 

of all, how there is no word

for so much splendor.

This, too, is a source

of consolation. Between you and memory

 

everything is water. Names of the dead,

or saints, or history.

There is a realm in which

—no, forget it,

 

it’s still too early to make anyone understand.

A man drives a stake

through his own heart

and afterwards the opposite of nostalgia

 

begins to make sense: he stops raking the leaves

and the leaves take over

and again he has learned

to let go.

Yes, we will add this story. We ask her,Will you add these poems to your repertoire of songsabout hunger & thirst & fur? & she, being wiser than we,

          after Neil deGrasse Tyson, black astrophysicist & director of the Hayden


          Planetarium, born in 1958, New York City. In his youth, deGrasse Tyson was


          confronted by police on more than one occasion when he was on his way to


          study stars.

“I’ve known that I’ve wanted to do astrophysics since I was nine years old, a first visit to the Hayden Planetarium...So I got to see how the world around me reacted to my expression of these ambitions. & all I can say is, the fact that I wanted to be a scientist, an astrophysicist, was, hands down, the path of most resistance...Anytime I expressed this interest teachers would say, Don’t you want to be an athlete? Or, Don’t you wanna...I wanted to become something that was outside of the paradigms of expectation of the people in power.

And I look behind me and say, Well, where are the others who might have been this? And they’re not there. And I wonder, What is the [thing] along the tracks that I happened to survive and others did not? Simply because of the forces that prevented it. At every turn. At every turn.”

The Skyview apartments

                    circa 1973, a boy is

kneeling on the rooftop, a boy who

                     (it is important

to mention here his skin

                    is brown) prepares his telescope,

the weights & rods,

                    to better see the moon. His neighbor

(it is important to mention here

                    that she is white) calls the police

because she suspects the brown boy

                    of something, she does not know

what at first, then turns,                    with her looking,

his telescope into a gun,

                    his duffel into a bag of objects

thieved from the neighbors’ houses

                     (maybe even hers) & the police

(it is important to mention

                    that statistically they

are also white) arrive to find

                    the boy who has been turned, by now,

into “the suspect,” on the roof

                    with a long, black lens, which is,

in the neighbor’s mind, a weapon &

                    depending on who you are, reading this,

you know that the boy is in grave danger,

                    & you might have known

somewhere quiet in your gut,

                    you might have worried for him

in the white space between lines 5 & 6,                    or maybe even earlier, & you might be holding

your breath for him right now

                    because you know this story,

it’s a true story, though,

                    miraculously, in this version

of the story, anyway,

                    the boy on the roof of the Skyview lives

to tell the police that he is studying

                    the night & moon & lives

long enough to offer them (the cops) a view

                    through his telescope’s long, black eye, which,

if I am spelling it out anyway,

                    is the instrument he borrowed

& the beautiful “trouble” he went through

                    lugging it up to the roof

to better see the leopard body of

                    space speckled with stars & the moon far off,

much farther than (since I am spelling The Thing

                    out) the distance between

the white neighbor who cannot see the boy

                    who is her neighbor, who,

in fact, is much nearer

                    to her than to the moon, the boy who

wants to understand the large

                    & gloriously un-human mysteries of

the galaxy, the boy who, despite “America,”

                    has not been killed by the murderous jury of

his neighbor’s imagination & wound. This poem                    wants only the moon in its hair & the boy on the roof.

This boy on the roof of this poem

                    with a moon in his heart. Inside my own body

as I write this poem my body

                    is making a boy even as the radio

calls out the Missouri coroner’s news,

                    the Ohio coroner’s news.

2015. My boy will nod

                    for his milk & close his mouth around

the black eye of my nipple.

                    We will survive. How did it happen?

The boy. The cops. My body in this poem.

                    My milk pulling down into droplets of light

as the baby drinks & drinks them down

                    into the body that is his own, see it,

splayed & sighing as a star in my arms.                    Maybe he will be the boy who studies stars.

Maybe he will be (say it)

                    the boy on the coroner’s table

splayed & spangled

                    by an officer’s lead as if he, too, weren’t made

of a trillion glorious cells & sentences. Trying to last.

 

 

Leadless, remember? The body’s beginning,

splendored with breaths, turned,

by time, into, at least, this song.

 

This moment-made & the mackerel-“soul”

caught flashing inside the brief moment of the body’s net,

then, whoosh, back into the sea of space.

 

The poem dreams of bodies always leadless, bearing

only things ordinary

as water & light.

I adore you: you’re a harrowing event.

I like you very ugly, condensed to one

deep green pang. You cannot ask the simplest

question, your hold is all clutch and sinker.

                                                  Cannibal old me,

with my heart up my throat, blasting on all sides

with my hundred red states. Hidden little striver.

How not to know it, the waist-deep trance of you,

the cursing, coursing say of you. Embarrassing today.

your body is a mouth, is a night of travel, your body

is tripling the sideways insouciance. The muscle

in you knows gorgeous, in you knows tornadoes.

In an instant’s compass, your blood flees you like a cry.

                                                  You put on my heat,

(that’s the way you work) I’m a bandit gripping

hard on the steal. The substitutions come swiftly,

hungering down the valley, no one question to cover

all of living. I arrange myself in the order of my use.

                                                  You’re wrong and right

at the same time, a breathless deluxe and a devouring

chopping down the back door. You slap my attention

all over the dark. What’s in me like a chime?

Sometimes, sometimes, I come to you for the surprise.

We stopped to watch the accident.

Fire! It had finally come to pass.

Just as surely as I was a coward

Be large with those small fears. The whole sky

has fallen on you and all you can do about it is

shout, dragging your fear-ettes by their pinked ears.

 

They dance a number now: consequence without

sequence. Lovingly broadminded in their

realization and ruin, expert at the parting shot.

 

Not so small after all, we micro to

macro, swelling to the horror shows

lifted from the sly ways of life.

 

You, both scorched and shining in the terror

of the equivocal moment, its box of cheeky

logics rattling cold certainties out of bounds

 

and into the plaits of a girl’s desirous ends.

A little debauched, the flirt in a freckling,

wondering spun to falling comes to this

 

pert contract of a paradox: saying things

because they will do no good, ringing change

in frumpy mono-determination, fruity and fruitless.

 

Exploded out of shelter, the tides come roaring in.

Let in the hoarse Cassandras and the dull pain of the

storyteller. You’ve needed those eyes all along.

 

We thought them disconcerting at first,

but it’s the only way. You live here now

having exchanged etiquette for energy.

Yesterday you say everything for their own sake,

and soon enough, tomorrow, you learn a lot from them.

On the morning of the 20th National Day

my uncle came home and told us:

“All our troops have got into position,

for the Russians may throw an atom-bomb on us today.”

 

After breakfast he returned to the headquarters,

but I had to go to school and join the celebration.

 

The fear oppressed my back like a bag of sand.

I could not raise the little triangle flag in my hand,

nor could I shout slogans with my classmates.

 

During the break I called together my best friends

and told them what would occur on this day.

Benli said, “I must go home

and tell my dad to kill all our chickens.”

Qingping said, “I must tell my aunt

not to buy a sewing machine.

Who would care about clothes if that happens.”

Yimin and I said nothing,

but we knew what we were going to do.

 

We decided to go to the army,

for we did not want to be roasted at home

like little pigs.

The sound of a guitar drifts through the air.

Cupped in my hand, a snowflake quivers lightly.

Thick patches of fog draw back to reveal

A mountain range, rolling like a melody.

I have gathered the inheritance of the four seasons.

There is no sign of man in the valley.

Picked wild flowers continue to grow,

Their flowering is their time of death.

Along the path in the primordial wood

Green sunlight flows through the slits.

A russet hawk interprets into bird cries

The mountain's tale of terror.

Abruptly I cry out,

""Hello, Bai—hua—Mountain.""

""Hello, my—child,"" comes the echo

From a distant waterfall.

It was a wind within a wind, drawing

A restless response from the land,

I whispered, and the snowflake

Drifted from my hand down the abyss.

Perhaps the final hour is come

The better to obstruct the wind of freedom

 We Lost Everything.

 

 

 

It is important to remember who would laugh first—

"Chapter Text


They’d just fired him.


How could this be? What kind of injustice is this?


At first, Jesse Marsch had been angry. He’d blamed the U.S. government, the Premier League, the wind, coffee, referees—you name it, he blamed it. But after a full fifteen minutes of ranting to his wall, Marsch’s fury vanished, leaving behind a giant Leeds-shaped hole in his heart.


He’d thought Leeds would keep him forever. And now it was all gone, stolen from him by some money-loving—


Jesse Marsch! He scolded himself, slapping his own thigh. He was sure the heavy slam had left a bruise, but he didn’t care. He needed to get out of this house, away from this city, somewhere. But where?

Judging by how the news had just come out, news of his sacking was probably on Monday Night Football. That meant wherever Marsch would try to go, somebody would recognize him. That bars out the pub.

He couldn’t breathe anymore. Everything around him served as a symbol of what he’d lost, the life he’d lived for little over a year. He threw together some things in an overnight bag and jumped into his car.

*

Klopp blankly stared out the window of his room. Not his room in Kirkby, which had truthfully become more of a home to him, but the house he’d rented from Rodgers.

He wouldn’t admit this to anybody, but Klopp had completely run out of ideas as to why Liverpool were doing so horribly. So after the Wolves game, Klopp went straight back to his house. He needed to step away from his job, even for half an hour.

As soon as he’d shut the door, though, Klopp had a new problem. The house lacked the sounds of daily life.

There was no sound of Nemmer or Thiago dropping a baking sheet or pot. No sound of Robertson and Alexander-Arnold chattering away, or Tsimikas remixing his rap songs, or Adrian’s snoring. There was no la-la-la from Van Dijk singing in the shower, no boom from Alisson’s ball cannon, not even a hiss from the coffee maker.

It was too quiet…until car tires screeched through the night. Then a car door slammed, and a trunk opened, and something wheeled across the driveway.

Then the doorbell rang.

Klopp jumped from his seat to answer, thinking it was one of the boys or even Lijnders. What he didn’t expect was a groveling American in blue jeans and a gray sweater.

“Take me in, please!!!”

Jesse Marsch was at his doorstep.

Jesse flipping Marsch.

*

“Jesse Marsch!” Klopp exclaimed. “How the hell did you find my house?!”

Marsch didn’t get off the ground. He clung to Klopp, temporarily immobilizing the German. “I don’t know how I got here! I just did!”

Klopp couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “So you arrived at my house without even knowing my address?”

“I was fired,” Marsch moaned, finally removing himself from the ground. “So I came to your place. You’re the only one who let me in—everybody else turned me away.”

“Who did you go to?” If it was one of his boys who’d turned Marsch away and made him this hysterical, then Klopp had a serious talk to give out.

Marsch shrugged, calmer than he’d been at first. “Well…Erik’s, Antonio’s, Ole’s and Gary’s.”

“You do realize that three of those four are Man. U affiliated and the fourth isn’t even in the country, right?”

Klopp could spot Marsch’s flushed face from a mile away. “I guess you’re right. But as long as you’re up…I brought Budweiser.”

“Come in.” Klopp shook his head, opening the door. “You’re lucky I’m not Jose or you wouldn’t have lasted two minutes.”

*

Marsch sat at the counter, watching Klopp grated cheese over a frozen pizza. For a while neither one of them said anything, to each other or to themselves. The only sound was the Parmesan rubbing against the grater and the oven warming up. Once the oven timer signaled that it was ready for the pizza, the talking began.

“So they sacked you,” Klopp began, pouring potato chips into a serving bowl. “I think that sucks.”

He regretted the word choice almost before the words left his mouth. But it seemed like the best way to put it.

“I just don’t get it. I mean, I did the best I could!” Marsch lamented. He didn’t even seem interested in the potato chips. “I saved Leeds from relegation on the final day, and I fell in love with them. Haven’t you ever been sacked?”

“I stepped down from Mainz and Dortmund. But I never got sacked.”

“Well, imagine if they ripped you away from your boys,” Marsch said, slowly nibbling on a chip. “And you left in disgrace from the people who once chanted your name.”

Klopp nodded in understanding. “I hate the thought of that. Couldn’t they give you something? More time, understanding, remembering what you’d done for them before? You were only there for one year.”

Marsch shook his head. “Leeds owners aren’t that understanding. I wish I had your owners.”

“Trust me, you were better off. I speak from experience. At least Man. City's owners allow them to buy players.”

“Their owners got hit with more than 100 charges against Fair Play rules.”

“Fair.” Klopp reached into the bowl only to hit the bottom of it. “More chips?”

Marsch flashed him a lopsided thumbs-up. “Only advantage about this is that we get to eat as many chips as we want.”",1
"Stu wakes up in a coffin and thinks, fuck. Last thing he knew, Sidney dropped a TV on his head and he was also bleeding out but currently, nothing hurts. He shifts around, determines he is actually in a coffin (the fuck?), and considers what to do.

Well, obviously, nothing can be done until he's out of the coffin, so he gets to work.

.

As he breathes the cool night air, Stu looks at the placemarker where a headstone should be. That tells him a little about how long it's been. Since he clearly won’t be able to get away with being an innocent survivor (he was fucking buried), Stu fixes the gravesite back to looking freshly-laid and not like someone just crawled out of it.

First things first, a change of clothes and some food. Then, finding out what the fuck happened.

.

What happened was that Sidney fucking Prescott somehow managed to kill both Stu and Billy, and not only that, but Gale Weathers, Tatum’s idiot brother, and fucking Randy Meeks all survived.

Billy died but Randy is still alive, and Stu seethes.

.

Billy died.

That’s… not an outcome Stu ever imagined. He figured there’s a good chance he himself wouldn’t make it, but Billy—

Billy doesn’t even have a grave. They cremated him. Makeshift memorials have gone up all over Woodsboro for everyone, all the way back to Sid’s mom, but Billy gets nothing.

Four days out of the grave, and Stu has never been so furious..

In a diner in Oregon, with a plateful of breakfast hash and a notebook full of half-baked ideas, Stu shivers as a tingle dances along his spine.

A pale guy slides into the booth across from him, messy dark hair that reminds him of Billy and a smirk that’s all teeth. Stu blinks at him but the guy just reaches out to steal his breakfast.

“Go on,” he says, adding salt and pepper to the hash, with a nod to the notebook. “I’m curious to see what you come up with.”

“Who the fuck are you?” Stu demands quietly because even though he’s supposed to be dead, everyone is still freaked out by the so-called Woodsboro Massacre. (Okay, the name is kinda cool. It still feels like failure because Billy—)

“Call me Ben,” he says, and now he’s reaching for Stu’s soda.

Stu just lets him take it. “Okay, Ben,” he hisses, pulling the notebook closer. “And what the fuck do you want?”

Ben’s pale eyes assess him as Ben leans back, still fucking smirking around Stu’s breakfast. “You need a teacher, kiddo,” he says, like he’s not barely older than Stu, from what Stu can tell. Stu’s normally good with accents but he can’t place Ben’s, just some bland Midwestern type thing.

“A teacher?” he echoes, because what?

“A mentor, an instructor, a trainer, take your pick,” Ben says before taking a gulp of the soda. “I’ve grown bored with my current circumstances, moralizing boyscouts always preaching at me, you know,” he continues though Stu, of course, does not know, “and you seem to be quite entertaining.”

Stu stares at him. He straightens up, pushes the plate and cup to the side, clasps his hands on the table. Seriously, quietly, he says, “You remind me of my brothers,” and he looks Stu straight in the eyes. “Without being tempered, you will attract attention and too much attention, Stuart, is fatal for our kind.” Ben grabs the knife from the tableware still wrapped in a napkin, scoffs at it, and as Stu watches in bewilderment, he slices open the pointer finger of his right hand.

And then, lightning dances across the finger, leaving unscored skin in its wake.

“What the fuck,” Stu murmurs. Ben just smirks at him again. Still. Stu wonders, inanely, if the bastard can even make another expression.  “Just… what the fuck.”

“Are you finished with breakfast?” Ben asks, pulling out his wallet. “I’m quite curious about the plans you’ve got in there.” He tilts his head toward Stu’s notebook, which Stu quickly flips closed.

Stu now leans back, crosses his arms over his chest. Then, he shrugs, says, “Ah, what the fuck,” and when Ben throws down a 20, he follows the guy out into the bright morning.",1
"It was the holiday season in Bound Arlyn, and you wracked your brain thinking of something special to give to Pollux. He frequented all of the local bakeries and candy shops in town on a regular basis so surprising him with holiday treats was next to impossible. He loved it when you went on dates with him to share sandwiches and creamy milkshakes, but you weren’t convinced it was special enough.Inspiration struck you one day when you were helping Arcturus in the academy kitchen. He was making a cheese sauce to accompany one of the side dishes at dinner. You were whisking the sauce to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pot.“Hey, Arcturus?”He hummed in acknowledgement while he was bent low, pulling a hot pan from the oven.“Have you ever had fondue?”Arcturus placed the tray on a cooling rack and took off his oven mitts. “Hm, I’m not sure that sounds familiar.”You explained to him it was like a presentation of a warm cheese used for dipping bread, potato, or certain types of fruit.“Oh, that sounds delicious!” Arcturus beamed at you. “I bet Pollux would love that too.”You experimented in the kitchen when you had free time. You decided to try making a chocolate fondue dip, experimenting with the ratios of cream, chocolate, and vanilla before adding a touch of sweet brandy.When you perfected your recipe, you walked into town to gather the missing items for Pollux’s gift. You couldn’t find a fondue pot, but you were able to find a small serving dish you could keep warm with a small lantern. You visited the bakery and grocer, picking up cookies and fresh fruits to slice and use for dipping. You gave Pollux a handwritten invitation to join you in your room later that evening. He blushed when he took the envelope from you, reading the card with a pleased twinkle in his eyes. “Are we having a tea party?” he asked excitedly. Tea parties always involved some sort of dessert.“Something like that.” You smiled at him and kept your response vague. You wanted to give him something to look forward to.Your plan went off without a hitch. Pollux arrived at your door right on time, wearing an elegant suit you’ve never seen before. He blushed and handed you a small bouquet of beautiful flowers. “These only bloom during the coldest months of the year,” he explained while you found a small vase to put them in. The blue and purple flowers almost looked like they were covered in fresh, powder-white snow. You wrapped your arms around him and pulled him close. “They’re beautiful, thank you.” The flush on his face deepened even more when you stood on your toes and kissed his cheek.He followed you to the little table you set up near the balcony doors, the dip already prepared and warming over a gentle flame. Pollux leaned over and looked into the pot.“Chocolate?”You used a small fork to pierce a slice of strawberry. “It’s a dish from back home,” you explained as you dipped the strawberry into the pot. “It’s a warm dip called fondue. It’s popular to make with cheese.” You leaned forward, cupping your hand under the fork and holding it in front of his mouth. “I thought you might enjoy trying the dessert version instead.”He held your gaze, eyes glittering while he wrapped his lips around the fruit and slid it off the fork. There was a small smudge of chocolate in the corner of his mouth. He wrapped his hand around your wrist before you could pull away. He put the fork back into his mouth, letting it slide between his lips while he chased the lingering hints of chocolate left behind. He grinned while he licked his lips.You set the fork back down on the table, and you looked at each other for a moment. Pollux turned away first, drawing a chair from under the table and taking a seat. He slowly unbuttoned his dinner jacket and loosened the tie around his neck. He had a teasing smile but the glint in his eye was no less hungry. He leaned back in his chair and patted his lap invitingly. You could already see the outline of his bulge straining against the zipper of his pants.“I’m starving.”",1
"His eyes were so warm and intense on me that I was sure he could read all my thoughts, everything I felt and thought about him, written on my pupils.It's not the same anymore. But I had enough time and enough reason to accept, that it's not the same anymore.Meeting you was like listening to a song for the first time and knowing it would be my favorite. You were the calm in my life of storm. I love talking to you even though I have nothing to say.When I saw you smile for the first time we were together, all I could think was ""Oh shit:.


 I wish I could explain those stars in my eyes when I'm with you. It's as if my soul was already in love with you and the rest of my body was just catching. You were an unexpected surprise, the defining moment. The collision of stars that slammed into me hard and sent my neat little world plummeting into the ocean.


I never expected it to be you. But it was you, and now you're not. And I hope, I'll see you again, when the roads decide it's time, for our paths to cross again.",1
"Ada: Salazar Castle: Bedroom:

 
I sat perched atop a windowsill, looking out at the green maze below. The bushes rustled in the cool wind, and the stars shone from above, peeking behind the clouds. The moon was nestled in between them comfortably, overlooking all, just like me. I thought me and the moon might get along quite well, always staring in the night, and disappearing by the time dawn breaks. And to my amusement, it turned out that the sun himself was down in that maze, shooting his gun at parasitic creatures. I smiled to myself, watching him dart around the garden in search of the two halves of the crescent moon that would grant him access to the bedroom– it seemed as if the sun was always in search of the moon, no matter the circumstances. I couldn’t be bothered by the tacky puzzle, so I just used my grappling hook to slide through an open window. The same window I’m sitting on right now, dancing on a fine line between plummeting down to the horrors below, and the safety of the red-plush carpet. 

Leon, the bright beam of sunshine, held the other half of the crest in his hand, fitting it together to see if they would click. In his hands now, he held the entire stone object. Too big to fit in his pockets, he held it in the crook of his arm and made his way around the maze, making his way to me. I smiled softly, tilting my head and seeing his oh-so determined expression. Seven years he hasn’t seen me, for seven years he’s thought of me as dead. I guess in some way that was true, when have I ever been alive? Through the thrill of a mission, maybe. But as a person? Who lives, and breathes normally? Who can get by without working for shady organizations and betraying them? No, I don’t think so. I’m like the phantoms that are surely stalking the halls of this castle, maybe even watching me right now. 

I suppose the only times I feel alive are when I’m around him. There’s always an exciting feeling that pulls on the deepest strings of my heart, exhilaration, excitement, and sometimes also sorrow. The sorrow of knowing that because of the roles we’ve decided to take in society, we could never wake up beside each other every day. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thinking about him every moment I had to myself, now I’d see him again, be able to hear him talking directly to me, be able to study the bags under his eyes, and the new length of his hair. I’m sure he’ll do the same for me, look at the black flutter of my eyelashes and make his way down to the shiny red fabrics of my dress, then finally to my strappy heels. Not like I won’t play my game though, he’ll have to catch me first. Can’t forget I also have a task at hand, to collect the sample. 

These creatures have shaped out to be quite a pain, however. The village chief was gone, courtesy of Leon, so he won’t be getting in the way anymore. Can’t say for that bratty Salazar, or Saddler. I’m sure they’ll be gone in due time, however. We always have these ways of working things out. It’s funny, of all the things we can do alone, we always fall apart when we’re together. Life works in such mysterious ways, it fascinates me. Always on the run, always watching and waiting but never settling. Me and the moon, Leon and the sunshine. The sun and the moon, always running to catch one another, always worlds away. 

Of all the people I’ve tricked and conned, I couldn’t find the courage in myself to do it to Leon. Sure, I’ll play games with him, smile, walk away and eventually vanish, but when it comes to it, I won’t lie to him. The truth is valuable, and it can save lives. Maybe even sometimes destroy them, believe me, I’ve learned that the hard way– but not when it comes to Leon. I’ll help him with his mission, and in the end, he’ll help me with mine. Everything always comes full circle. 

Even in terms of the moon. 

Even when covered partially by clouds, the spherical shape always resides behind the darkness, hiding, 

Always with the sun, 

It’ll always burn brightly. 

Breathing in the crisp night air, I hopped down from the window and walked slowly behind the door, red painted nails shining against the shiny silver of my gun. I could feel it this time, the pounding in my heart, the anticipation. There was a click at the door, the crest was being set into place. 

Pushing up my sunglasses, a smile played across my glossed lips. 

It was time to say hello. 

It was time to bask in the light of the sun.",1
"“I just don’t think we’re ready.” There’s so much to say, bubbling up behind a wall keeping the emotions at bay. They’re not even far from the group, but Foolish had to say it, he clutches the poppy close to his chest. The delicate flower that he hadn’t let go of since he got it. The red is just as vibrant as he hands it back to the shorter. Hands barely grazed one another and yet it felt like too much- perfect- not enough. Mariana brought a hand up to stroke the petals, they hadn’t begun to wilt despite how long they remained without water. Still, Mariana brought it close to his chest as Foolish had done moments ago. It was almost enough to stop the confusion and sadness. 
 
There was so much they could tell each other. Maybe in another life, this moment was where they talked and realized they could love. That this new environment was a fresh start where they could learn. Be together with nothing holding them back. Grow a garden of flowers. Instead, Mariana continued to clutch the singular flower and look up at Foolish with a small hesitant kind of smile. “When- When you are ready. I will be here.” 
 
“Right.” Foolish grinned but it lacked teeth, something more intimately dejected. He paused, debating his next move before taking a step closer and bringing the other into a hug. Mariana held the flower between them but used his one free arm to return the hug. Head resting on the other chest he could hear the thundering heartbeat and it strangely… gave him comfort. The other wasn’t content either, but Mariana wasn’t going to push or pressure, not with the wound so freshly cut. 
 
They pulled away, and he.. well, Mariana couldn’t find what to say. Not in english. “mi amor no se empañara como el oro de tu piel” and he means it. Foolish nods even though he doesn’t understand, and his smile grows wider. 
 
Then the shark takes a step back, then another. Mariana waves, and they both turn away. 
 
There was so much more to them than they could currently remember. Foolish and Mariana an unlikely duo. A god and a man, ageless and young, they barely speak one anothers language. Yet they seem inexplicably intertwined; the passion of love transcends. It will return; they’re far too enchanted.",1

"The door slid open. A pretty, but stone-faced girl with short black hair and freckles walked in. She had a giant black bag slung over her shoulder, but either it was empty or she was strong enough not to notice the weight. The clicking of her footsteps echoed around the silent room, the only other sound being quiet gasps of confusion from some of my classmates. I glanced over at the still-open door. A figure lurked there in a black suit. Red eyes glowed between long, dark locks that obscured most of his face and flowed to the floor.

The girl reached the teacher's desk. For a moment, there was complete silence. She dropped the bag on the desk.

Soshun didn't waste a second. He stepped forward, his voice swelling into Student Council President Mode™. ""You! Talk! I don't know where you get off threatening us, but it's not going to work!""

Kiriko's voice wavered for a moment as she piped up. ""Th-that video...was it real?""

The girl remained silent.

""Why'd we have to hold this dumb meeting so late?"" Aiko pouted, resting her chin on her fists.

""This is not at all how we operate."" Hino added, and Kubo nodded furiously.

The girl finally spoke, her voice softer than I expected. ""Student Council members. In accordance with my sister's will, you will now murder each other.""

My eyebrows shot up. Murder?!

A chair scraped against the floor. ""Are you crazy?!"" Ikuta burst out, slapping her hands on the desk in front of her. ""Why the hell would we do something like that?!""

Soshun turned to her and flung out his hand. ""That's enough! It's essential that we all remain calm!"" If the situation wasn't so serious, I would've snorted. He knew, probably better than anyone, that trying to calm Ikuta was fruitless. ""Should we succumb to--""

""Hold it."" The voice was low and quiet, but somehow stunned even Soshun into silence. Everyone's heads turned in near-unison. The girl was pointing a gun at Ikuta. I could tell from her stance she knew what she was doing with it. Her line of sight was clear, and her thumb rested on the safety.

The long-haired boy entered the room, but she held the gun steady. He continued, ""I have changed my mind.""

The girl's eyes widened, and she whipped her head around to look at the boy, gun still trained perfectly on Ikuta. ""Wh-what?! Don't you want to see true Despair?""

The boy snorted and closed his eyes. ""Killing...is not true Despair. Killing, Death...are not interesting. They're...predictable. You kill her, they kill each other. Maybe you. But that small variation alone is not enough to be...unique.""

There was a blur of motion, and suddenly the gun was in his hand,  pointed at the girl. ""If this is truly the best Despair has to offer me...then I'll be on my way."" The gun clattered to the floor, and he turned to leave.

""Wait! But Junko--""

""Junko is also...not unique. Besides, this was not what she predicted from me. Wouldn't that...give her that Despair she loves so much?"" He dragged out the word ""Despair"" with as much venom as his completely deadpan voice could muster. ""Tell your sister to come back when she comes up with something actually exciting."" He left the room, the girl running after him.

Nobody spoke. Ikuta slowly sat back down. Soshun approached the desk and pulled open the bag. ""This is...an obscene amount of weapons!"" he said, mostly to himself. He turned back to face us. ""I'm going to confiscate these and take them to our headmaster. I think it would be best if we all departed before she returns.""

Several nods of agreement, and we dispersed back to our rooms. Ikuta didn't say a word, just nodded to everyone and left. I wasn't exactly surprised, though; that mouth of hers nearly got her killed.

I went back to my room and lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. Would we...have really done it? Could any of us have...actually killed each other? No, definitely not. That would be ridiculous.

I rolled over and fell asleep.",1
"Chapter Text
Yujin couldn't help it.
It wasn't his fault.
It just happened that way.He was watching just like everyone else. Watching as each trainee walked out with a wig and light makeup.And then there was Gunwook.Why Gunwook? What drew him to Gunwook? Nothing had. At least, not before... but now...Gunwook looked so pretty, he should dye his hair a light orange. His sharp features had a new edge in this light. In the pastels.They'd never even spoke - not really, there wasn't a chance.
And Yujin was anxious.Han Yujin was always anxious.
Gunwook made him anxious before because he was so driven, right? He was so determined, so praised...
Yujin was...""Yujin-ah, you okay?""
Jiwoong. Always looking out for him.
Yujin stared at his hands by the sink, looking up at himself through the reflection of the mirror.Never before had he considered boys. There just wasn't a chance.Wasn't a Gunwook.""Yeah, Hyung, just finishing up.""Yujin exited the bathroom, wiping his hands on his pants.Jiwoong rubs Yujin's hair as he walks past.""You've been so quiet lately,"" he says, ""you okay?""How does Yujin tell Jiwoong about this? Jiwoong acts in BLs, he wouldn't be rude about it.But Yujin doesn't even know how he feels.Maybe, maybe it's not Gunwook, maybe it's just girl-Gunwook.Voices trail down the hall, and Yujin stiffens, on edge.It's just Keita and Junhyeon.Yujin ignores how Jiwoong watches Keita.""I'm fine, just stressed about the next stage.""Jiwoong tears his gaze back to Yujin, you'll be great. I know it. Don't worry about anything, the masters are too harsh on you.""""Yeah... thanks.""
He feels horrible.***Yujin's dorm is empty that night. He's reading, the only occupied bed in the room. He doesn't know where the others are, and he doesn't want to deal with the chance encounter of Gunwook.Someone knocks on the door.""Come in!"" He calls.Gunwook pokes his head around the corner, and Yujin's heart sinks to his stomach.
The one person he was trying to avoid.Gunwook clearly doesn't know, or care. Completely oblivious to Yujin's feelings that just barely bubble bellow the surface.In the creeping edges of his mind, he sees another life. One where they meet for coffee at the store by Yujin's house, their hands swaying as they walk together in the park, cuddling up close in the cinema.His eyes burn at the life that never was.""Hey... Yujin-ah.""Everyone's informal because he's the baby. Of course.""Have you seen Sung Hanbin-hyung?Oh.""Uh, no, sorry.""Gunwook nods, lingering.Stay.""Alright, sorry to interrupt"" He looks at Yujin's hands, ""-your book.""Yujin looks down, completely oblivious to the fact he'd even been reading before.""Oh, no, it's okay, I'm barely reading it anyway.""Gunwook laughs. It's so, right. Like, what you want to hear. The laugh of someone who genuienly finds you funny.He wants to always make Gunwook laugh.""I can relate to that.""It's still for a moment. Yujin's hoping the cameras won't broadcast this to the world.It's their moment. The fresh encounter of two teenagers just finding their footing in the world.Please, let me have just this much.Gunwook sighs - not of annoyance - right? No, more like, I'll get going now, right?""I'll see you later, yeah?""Yujin nods, ""Yeah... later.""And Gunwook disappears out of sight, shutting the door quietly behind him.Shit.",1

"The sky darkened and snow fell gently around you while you waited for Spica at the train station. There was a celebration planned at his family’s ancestral home, and he was eager to show you Bound Arlyn’s finest holiday traditions.You waved when you saw him step into view nearby. His long blonde hair was tied in a braid so it didn’t tangle in his scarf. He wore a long coat of emerald green with fur trim. He looked particularly handsome today with snowflakes dusting his fine hair and pale skin.“I’m sorry for the delay, there was a mix-up with our tickets. Shall we?” He slipped the handle for your luggage out of your grip and pulled it for you beside his own. You fell into step with his long stride as he moved aside so you could board ahead of him.You glanced back over your shoulder as you stepped inside the carriage. “Wait, what about the others? Aren’t they coming too?” The other Guide sorcerers were usually on the guest list for Spica’s parties.He hesitated for a moment, looking away. “I’m afraid they’re busy with other engagements this evening.”You shrugged and followed him to your seats.The festivities were starting to wind down and you watched Spica with amusement as he finished another glass of wine. You didn’t drink often, and you barely finished your own glass despite sipping it throughout dinner and the dessert that followed. His cheeks were ruddy-pink and his eyes a bit glossy in the warm candlelight of the dining hall. You caught his gaze across the table and he flashed you a wide smile. He came over to you, sliding your chair out from the table and offering his arm before leading you away. He walked you to his private chambers in a quiet wing of the large estate. You had an arm wrapped around his waist to help support his uneven gait. He held you to his side with an arm slung across your shoulders. When you slipped through his bedroom door, you walked him over to the bed. He sat down and you unbuttoned his shirt while he slid off his shoes. He loosened his tie earlier in the evening so you slid it from around his collar and set it aside. His shirt fell into an undignified heap on the floor. He slumped over and got comfy against the pillows with his undershirt and dress pants still on.It only took a minute for you to slip off your dress and pull a nightgown over your head. When you lifted the blankets and slid into bed beside him, Spica rolled over to face you. You cuddled into his chest and he wrapped an arm around you with a deep, happy sigh. Yo could smell the sweet alcohol lingering on his breath.“It’s a shame the others couldn’t make it tonight,” you said quietly, head resting under his chin. “Pollux would’ve loved the desserts.”“Didn’t invite ‘em,” Spica mumbled into your forehead with a yawn. “Wanted it to just be the two of us.” When you pulled back in surprise, he was already fast asleep.A gentle hand was stroking your hair when you woke up. You blinked the sleep from your eyes and raised your head from where you were sleeping on his chest. His eyes were clear this morning, the tipsy haze gone, and they were so tender and full of love.“Good morning,” he murmured as he continued to brush his fingers through your hair.“Good morning,” you said with a sleepy smile. He smiled back when you covered a yawn with your hand. “What time is it?”He glanced towards the large windows of his room. They were frosted over with cold. “Still early, I believe. Just before dawn.”You pressed closer into his side and burrowed into the warm sheets. “How do you feel?” You didn’t want to ask him directly if he was hung over, but he guessed your meaning when you tried to suppress a giggle.“A slight headache, but nothing unbearable,” he sighed. “Did you enjoy the party?”You recalled the festive decorations, the delicious food, and the other party guests that greeted you with kindness. “I loved it. I can almost see why you didn’t want to invite anyone else.”Spica froze beside you and he seemed to be struggling for words. “We don’t get time alone as much as I would like,” he admitted, “and I wanted our first Christmas together to be special.” He frowned. “I didn’t want to babysit those troublemakers. Besides, it’s not proper to drink with children in attendance.”You sat up and laughed as you pressed a kiss against his cheek. “I always trust your judgment and last night was perfect.” You nuzzled your nose with his. “Thank you.”One of his hands cradled the back of your head and drew your lips down into a kiss. It was slow and gentle but no less passionate. You moaned softly and eventually you drew back to catch your breath.He held you close and rolled over gently so you were underneath him. He ran his hands up your thighs and under your nightgown as he kissed you again, gliding his tongue against your own. During the night he must’ve slipped off his dress slacks because you felt his cock harden inside the silky material of his boxer shorts. You wrapped a leg around his, grinding up against him encouragingly. He pulled down the waistband of his boxers and you gasped when you felt him slide inside you with one long, slow thrust.You moved together under the sheets as the sun shone down on you through frosted glass.",1
"Chapter Text
Kat’s first actual impression on Molly was that she murdered Andrea. Well, there was the whole pronouncing Andrea’s name thing, but she can’t blame the new kid for that. But what’s jarring, is that on the same day, Molly is found at the stage carrying Andrea’s unmoving body. Thankfully, Andrea woke up and explained everything before anyone could get any ideas. After that, Kat was sure that she won’t see Molly again. Until she randomly took a picture of her and showed up at the Wilderscouts camping trip. She saw that list Molly was carrying around during the whole trip, was the new kid; grading them? For what? And right before everyone goes home, Kat saw Libby giving Molly a friendship bracelet. Sure, that wasn’t weird, the former outcast trying to make friends with the new kid. It makes sense why Libby would prefer Molly over her and Sheela. But what didn’t make sense to her is how Molly reacted. It’s nice to make new friends, but to get so excited over it to the point where you tackle them with a hug? Who does that? She thought about it a lot on the ride home and… Did Molly even have friends before moving to Brighton?",1
"It's odd being paired with Minho when filming content. Seungmin's not really used to the one-on-one proximity with his boyfriend in front of the cameras. Whenever they’re shown together, it’s under the guise of their “Divorced” status and their interactions are always painted as awkward. 
 

It angers Seungmin, 

just 

a bit. 
 

Okay. Maybe a lot. 
 

Seungmin and Minho are the furthest thing from awkward. They're probably among the closest within the group, actually. The fact that they’re right here, in a cramped ass room to get clues so they can escape, the 

day after

 they’ve made it official and are acting completely normal is testament to how comfortable they are with each other. 
 

They're on the same wavelength on just about everything. They're both calm and collected despite half their members screaming up a storm in the adjacent rooms. They both get suspicious about the same things. 
 

They both find themselves constantly sharing glances and averting each other's eyes throughout filming, having to suppress the shy smiles that threaten to break. The editors would have their work cut out for them, going through the footage and clipping out their incessant sickeningly longing gazes. He wonders how they’ll spin their silence as awkward again. 
 

And maybe Seungmin feels his heart pick up and zoom within the confines of his ribcage when they lean a bit close and Minho’s warmth envelops him whole. 
 

Maybe his heart literally jumps into his throat when their thumbs brush. Maybe he feels his brain melt into goo when he films Minho mercilessly ripping into the stuffed puppy with the widest smile on his face and childlike joy. He does call Minho a psychopath when his boyfriend literally 

giggles, 

but 

hey, 

Minho’s 

his 

psychopath, alright?
 

Maybe he wants to kiss Minho and keep him in his arms forever when he randomly says, “Is there a ring in this?”, as they dig into the suspicious cake. Frankly, he wanted to kiss Minho on a hundred different occasions already—cut him some slack; they’re still in their honeymoon phase—and to his abject mortification, his insufferably cunning boyfriend catches on to his desires. 
 

Seungmin thinks he’s about to fucking 

faint 

when Minho reads out a note telling them they could close the blinds if they needed privacy and 

proceeds to close the fucking blinds. 

 

“What?” He fumbles, watching dumbly as his boyfriend closes the distance between them within two steps. When Minho stops in front of him, looking down at him with a disgustingly smug grin and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, his hand automatically goes up to rest on his thigh. That seems to be the right move since Minho bends down, cradles his cheek with a stupidly gentle hand and captures his lips in a firm kiss. 
 

Seungmin startles, gasping into the kiss. Their mics are still on, and they’re 

filming, 

and sure the angle towards the camera just shows Minho’s back and they can get away with saying he was wiping something off Seungmin’s face, but it was still so 

risky

—yet that made the kiss all the more sweeter. 
 


Fuck. 

 

Seungmin’s entranced in the sensation of Minho’s plush lips moving against his own; he can feel his lipstick imprinting on his skin. The tender glide of Minho’s thumb on his cheekbone only intensifies the crimson flush on his face. For a moment, he forgets where they 

are, 

the fact that there are still cameras and microphone and staff and—
 

Minho finally pulls away with a self-satisfied grin, throwing Seungmin a wink before turning back to open the blinds and continue the show. 
 

Seungmin’s still trying to recover from his haze, his insides doing flips as thrill and giddiness coalesce into a sanity destroying concoction. 
 

He can’t even find it in himself to call Minho out on his dangerous behavior as his mind’s still reeling from the slight tingle in his lips. 
 

Lee Minho will be the death of him, Seungmin laments, as they pick up where they’ve left off for the show. 
 

And maybe, Seungmin’s determined to see it through till the very end.",1
"Chat Noir was gliding through Paris with his baton, enjoying how the breeze felt against him. He was on the way to see Y/N.He reaches your balcony and perched on the railing. He peers through the slit of the curtains to see Y/N busy drawing something, looking very concentrated on it. Chat didn’t want to interrupt you yet so he sat there, observing how your pencil-clad hand glided across the paper and how your eyebrows would scrunch up when you had to erase a part of your drawing.He soon snapped himself out of his trance and jumped off the railing, walking to your balcony door and knocking on it to alert you of his presence. Y/N flinched slightly at the sound since you were so engrossed in your drawing and turned your head towards your balcony. Y/n smiled at the sight of her love and rushes towards the door to open it for him.“Hello, my love.” Adrien said as he walked into your room, de-transforming.Plagg gagged at the words Adrien said. “Yuck! Do that mushy stuff away from me!”Y/N giggles at Plagg. “Hello to you too guys.”Plagg decides to hang out at Y/N’s desk and announced that he was going to get some sleep so he won’t hear or see any affection between Adrien and Y/N.“Anyways, how are you doing?” Adrien asks as he looked around your room, ever since he first came into your room he noticed that it perfectly describes you. Some drawings that you made were on the wall along with some posters of your favorite music artists and anime. Your plushies were scattered on your bed and the aesthetic of your room with your favorite colors blended perfectly together.“I’m doing fine, I was just finishing up a drawing.” Y/N said as she yawned.“What are you drawing? It’s midnight now so it must be good if you’re risking your sleep schedule for it. Don’t forget that you need your beauty sleep my purrincess,”You lightly laughed at the pun, “I’m doing a landscape drawing and I want to get it done early because I have ideas for other drawings but I’ll make sure that I get my beauty sleep.”Adrian smiles and hugs you. “How about you do it when the sun is up, we can sleep in the meantime.”Y/n reciprocates his hug. “Yeah, you’re right. I’m halfway done anyways.” They let go of each other and you went to clean up your desk area. You saw that Plagg laid on one of your books and you smile softly at the sight, grabbing a small piece of fabric and gently putting it on him as a substitute blanket.“So how’s saving the world going for you?” Y/N asks as Adrien plops himself on your bed.“It’s the usual, same old,” he says with a sigh. You him and joins him on the bed. “I don’t think I’d be fit as a hero, I’d get tired and exhausted of fighting villains everyday.”Adrien laughs at that, “well superhero-ing isn’t for everyone.” He muses. When he first became Chat Noir he didn’t know what to do and was clueless on the whole superhero thing. But as he saved Paris more and more he got used to it and started to enjoy it - helping people and saving the city.You guys cuddled up together with you being the big spoon. There was a comforting silence in the room for a few moments until you two heard Plagg’s snores. For such a small thing he sure could snore a lot.The sound of Plagg’s snores soothed you and you started to feel sleepy, your eyes starting to slowly flutter close and your breaths starting to even out. But before you could succumb to the blissfulness of sleep, Adrien started to shake you. “Purrincess, you can’t sleep without having a good night kiss. It’ll make your sleep way better.”You narrow your eyes at him. “Really? I was so close to sleeping but you disturbed it just to get a good night kiss?” You asked incredulously. Yeah, you loved kissing Adrien but you loved sleeping more.“Purrety please,” he dragged out the last word and gave you puppy dog eyes - which was ironic considering he’s a feline superhero.Y/n couldn’t help but give in to his cuteness. You leaned in to give him a slow, relaxing kiss which Adrien responded to eagerly, his hand moving to your nape to keep you in place. Once they were running out of air, they pulled away from each other.“Now I’ll let you go to sleep.” Adrien says smugly and you groan in relief, letting sleep take over you. Adrien pulls you closer to him, also letting sleep succumb to him.",1
"In the 26th Century humanity has colonised the solar system and established outposts on many of the system’s planets and moons as well as beyond. The Earth Empire is constantly expanding and at one point this led to a Galactic war between humans and the alien Kree.After the war Intergalactic boundaries were established between the Kree and Earth empires and an uneasy peace is maintained.However, now that Earth was aware of the existence of Extra-Terrestrial life measures were taken to protect the colonies from future possible threats.General Nicholas Fury was a veteran of the Kree war and in 2552 he founded the Space Hazards Intelligence and Elite Line of Defence organisation to protect the empire from threats both inside and out. This organisation came to be known as SHIELD and had a mobile base of operations that patrolled the borders of the empire, ready to deploy when needed.There were, however, others that took an interest in protecting humanity.After an attack from the rogue Asgardian known as Loki a group of like-minded scientists got together and started a new programme no as the Avengers Initiative.These scientists were Tony Stark, Henry Pym and Bruce Banner and with the co-operation of the Asgardian, Thor, the Avengers Initiative was born.They operated from a space station base owned by Stark and were ready to deploy against any threats that were too big for SHIELD to handle.Despite this newfound awareness of the dangers that the universe held, there was still a desire to explore the galaxy and expand the empire where possible.The Future Foundation was founded by the super-genius Reed Richards and its primary goal is exploration.As well as the potential threat of another Extra-Terrestrial incursion there also exist threats within the empire itself. These include HYDRA a secret organisation that sprang up during the war hoping to take over both the Kree and Earth empires; AIM a technological organisation with similar ambitions for galactic domination and then there’s the Sinister Syndicate, a criminal faction responsible for 95% of all the empire’s crime.One of the biggest colonies in the empire is New York Colony, a bustling space port metropolis.This is where our story will begin and where we’ll be introduced to our three main protagonists:Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Miles Morales.Mutants are also a part of this future human society and as per usual they are feared and hated by the majority of ‘normal’ humans.There are two factions of mutant society. The Krakoa Colony founded by Charles Xavier and the Genosha Colony of Eric Lensher and his Brotherhood.The X-Men of Krakoa fight to protect the empire in an effort to convince other humans that mutants can be trusted.The Brotherhood, however, seek to overthrow and rule ‘lesser’ humans.During the Kree war biological terrigen weapons were used that created mutated super-powered humans that became known as Inhumans. A lot of these transformations were unpredictable, and the end results created as many problems for the Kree as they did for the humans.After the war many of these Inhumans struggled to find a place in human society. Some became heroes and protectors of their colonies; others became criminals and used their power for personal gain. Some sought entry into the Avengers Initiative.A separate colony was founded by an Inhuman known as Blackbolt that now serves as a safe haven for all Inhumans should they wish it.These are all things that our protagonists will run into and interact with through the course of their various adventures.More details will be revealed as the series progresses.",1
"Toni’s got it all planned down to a T. She’s got dancers, she’s got singers, she’s got a whole ass 

choreography

 that she, herself, came up with. Toni even has everyone in drama club and marching band involved, all of them agreeing to help with her plan before she’d been able to finish explaining it. It’s something Shelby would never expect from her, but hopefully likes well enough to say 

yes. 


Through all of her classes, Toni’s practically buzzing with nervous energy, knee bouncing constantly to the point that Fatin has to smack her and tell her to cut it the fuck out. She can’t help it though, she just wants to make this 

perfect

 for Shelby. The girl who’d sought her out one day after basketball practice, hanging back after classes and pretending to study in the library, just to 

accidentally

 run into Toni. To tell her she thinks Toni’s cute, and ask Toni, blushing furiously in front of her whole team, if she wants to go get a burger and fries at the drive in sometime.

It’s been months since then, months that Toni’s felt so stupid and happy in a way she never thought she’d get to feel. In the way they always show in those cheesy teen romcoms that Shelby makes her watch, that Toni always 

secretly

 enjoys, despite the fact that she protests every time. But there’s just 

something

 about laying on Shelby’s bed with her, watching a movie, breathing in the sweet floral scent of her shampoo, being helpless when Shelby turns to her and presses her back against the pillows for just a few stolen minutes, kissing her deeply and tangling her fingers in Toni’s hair. That’s as far as they’ve gone, and honestly Toni’s more than fine with it; she thinks the possibility of anything more might be enough to send her into cardiac arrest seeing as how her heart always feels like it’s halfway to bursting when Shelby sighs into her mouth between kisses.


Christ.


Toni drags a hand roughly through her hair. All she needs to do now is show up on the football field after school, and somehow get Shelby to agree to meet her there. Well – Fatin’s apparently got that part under control, so that’s one less thing to worry about, and Toni crouches down after the last bell, double knotting her shoes one last time, wanting to make certain she’s not about to trip down the bleachers in the middle of this and embarrass herself in front of everyone.

Their school’s football field is set deep in a hillside, with traditional and stone seats staggering up the hill, and Toni’s pulse is pounding in her ears as she takes the mic from the guy on the AV club, making her way to the top of the bleachers. When she sees Fatin and Shelby walk out to the side of the field, Toni waves, and the marching band starts playing.

It’s the opening bars to 

Can’t Take My Eyes off of You, 

because Shelby loves that song, loves 

10 Things I Hate About You,

 and Toni figures, what better way to ask her what she needs to ask than in song?

Toni doesn’t sing. She hates her voice, hates hearing it played back to her, and she knows she can’t carry a tune to save her life. But here she is, running around on these bleachers like she’s a modern-day Heath Ledger, belting out the words (albeit badly) to this song, and the huge grin on Shelby’s face is making it all worth it. When Toni finally finishes the song, she’s managed to run all the way down to the field, and the marching band and drama club and all the extra dancers and singers who agreed to help her are in the shape of one, single word, on the field.

Toni walks up to Shelby, smiles at her in a way Marty always jokes makes her look like a puppy, and reaches out for Shelby’s hand. 

“Come up to the top of the bleachers with me? Just for a sec?” Toni asks, voice soft.

Shelby rolls her eyes in an attempt to brush off the blush dusting her cheeks, and Toni thinks she looks so beautiful that her heart 

aches

 from how full it feels.

“You came all the way down here just to ask me to do some exercise?” Shelby teases, but she laces her fingers with Toni’s and climbs the bleachers with her, one step at a time.

“Shelby Goodkind,” Toni says, turning toward the field, pointing to the word 

Prom

 that practically half the school has spelled out. “Will you go to prom with me?”

Shelby squeals and throws her arms around Toni’s neck, kissing her soundly on the mouth and Toni’s mind empties as she kisses her back.

“Of course I will, baby,” Shelby murmurs against Toni’s lips, kissing her again. “Of course I’ll go to prom with you, you big goofball.”",1
"Chapter Text

Arcaea’s World 
The world of Arcaea is vast and sprawling, filled with dynamic landscapes and varying conditions. The land is filled with unique locations and amazing scenery, not to mention the fantastical glass containing memories.However, the world of Arcaea was much emptier in the past, a land filled with spontaneous ruins and abandoned structures of all kinds. Few have ever come to this world and even fewer have met, a current total of 3 meetings having happened.In the present, Arcaea is much more filled, yet those that were present in the past and still wander this world up until now are less than five. An inevitable question comes to mind after observing these differences; what had happened?Those that play Arcaea will understand this next bit of lore. Post Final Verdict and A Perfect Wish, a certain someone had rewritten the world according to her will.With her command, the world changed and made itself even more “perfect” in her eyes. The eternal day shines ever-bright in this world, preventing the darkness of night from ever showing up, unless a certain condition is fulfilled.On a side note, those who wake up in this world have strangely lost all their memories. What happened?
The Memory Glass
These shards of glass are also called Arcaea. They are memories having taken the form of glass. These shards compromise the world and its contents, being the foundation of the world.They can be controlled to one’s will at varying degrees. Some are very skilled while others do not have the ability at all.It can take many forms and even change shape, from living beings to even the material buildings and the ground itself.Shards can be distinguished within these categories:Light, of goodness and joy,Conflict, of negativity and darkness.In this realm, glass usually contains simple memories that have no real side effects unless they are…
Anomalous Shards
These shards are not meant to exist. They are anomalies and can cause varying side effects in the real world. They can contain the past memories of the person viewing it and information about the world. It can even contain information about different worlds. The content of anomaly shards are not limited to these three categories.These anomalous shards can make a person recover their memory, though the conditions for an anomalous shard appearing to someone varies wildly between each person.Anomalies are few and far in between, usually gone within a short time or sealed away.But amongst the anomalies, there are special ones that can set events into motion and even physically change the viewer’s appearance.",1
"“There, that should about do it! How do you you feel, Nai? Are the knots too tight in any places?”
 
You step back in order to inspect your work. The plant in question looks bored to death despite the bright red blush creeping up his neck. Rolling his eyes, he folds his legs closed with an amused huff. He’s about to tell you that he’s fine, your silly human bondage can’t hurt him until a rope goes between his folds and rubs him uncomfortably. He was hoping you didn’t notice his moment of weakness but of course you did, you’re always incredibly observant when it comes to him. Lifting the rope, you move it to the side so he can lay back in peace, slick already gathering near his entrance. From what he’s told you, he hasn’t experienced intimacy like this with another living being. To let a human put him in mock-bondage must seem insane to him, and incredibly not-worth it. It’s amazing he trusts you this much, despite everything. 
 
“Well?” 
 
His voice draws you from your daze and you realize he’s flexing his calf muscles in anticipation. You lick your lips and begin peppering the skin of his abdomen with kisses, dragging your tongue across his hipbones and nibbling the sensitive skin there. He flinches for a moment before relaxing somewhat. Letting out a shuddering breath, he nods for you to continue. The moment you kiss his pubic mound his breath hitches and small drops of slick begin dripping out of his entrance. His scent is intoxicating, smelling almost floral. Smiling, you can’t help but spread his folds apart with your thumb and index finger in order to see him better. Deciding to go easy on him, you lick a stripe up to his clit. He tastes even sweeter than he smells, and you almost miss the way he eyes you and throws his head back.
 
“Almost there,” You murmur in between licks, easing a couple fingers in to speed him along. “You’re doing such a good job, Nai.”
 
His back arches up off the mattress as you bury your fingers in his folds, thrusting in and out at a slow pace as to get him used to the feeling. He eventually lays back down, wrapping his strong legs around your head so he can have some semblance of control. You smirk against him and you’re certain he can feel it with the way he clenches around your fingers. Nai cries out when you finally apply suction to his aching clit  and begin thrusting a certain spongy area within him. Tumbling over the edge, his trembling thighs all but anchor you in place as he uses your face to ride out each intense wave of his orgasm. You make sure to savor everything he gives you and not let a single drop go to waste. You don’t stop drinking him until he yanks you off of him by the hair, and he’s truly a sight to behold. 
 
Nai’s entire face is red and his plant markings are glowing brighter than you’ve ever seen them. He’s out of breath, and before you can tease him about it he wipes the smirk off your face with a searing kiss. Your lips smack as they separate, a thin strand of saliva connecting you both. He’s still shuddering from the aftershocks, so you lean your forehead against his. Eventually he looks back up at you as the markings fade out, leaving his tired expression behind.
 
“Human.. if that’s what I’ve been missing for the past century, then I’m sure I can make time for it— for us, every day.”",1
"Gundou's phone vibrated, shaking with motion, on the top of her desk. She picked it up and saw that the person calling her was none other than Noor from the failed Indian branch who now resides as the manager for the failing English branch. Gundou thought it was odd that a person whose skin is the same color of shit was calling her but she picked up the phone regardless. ""Moshi moshi,"" she said into the receiver.Angry shouting came out the other end of the line. Gundou had trouble understanding it because it sounded so similar to the noises an animal makes.""Why are you calling me,"" she asked, ""Tell me now or I'll hang up.""Finally, Noor began speaking a human language and said, ""Gundou, I just saw your baseball tweet and I demand an explanation!""""An explanation? Why?""""Because calling for violence is extremely offensive. I'm offended and I'll make sure you know I'm offended. Durka.""""What? Oh, the baseball joke. Yeah it was pretty funny.""""Sir, do not redeem,"" Noor's inner Indian (tech support) came out, ""Do the needful and apologize.""""You know pitchers hit batters all the time, right? Not only to force walks but also to injure the other player. It's called a beanball for a reason and when that happens both bullpens usually come out and fight.""Beanball? Bullpen? Noor's less developed mind couldn't understand such concepts, ""So if you do not apologize then you will be suspended.""""Why? Vox, Hex, Luca, Kyo, and Fulgur are all a bunch of pedophiles trying to groom their young audience made up entirely of teenage girls who take so much medication that they're blood could cause George Floyd to overdose.""Noor was fuming but was running late for the yearly cow piss drinking ceremony so she said, ""I will suspend you and will try my hardest to get you fired. Durka.""Gundou set down her phone and went about her day as if nothing happened.",1
"Alpheratz held your hips with his large, calloused hands while you worked yourself against his thigh. You were straddling him in the armchair in his private chambers, his shirt unbuttoned and his thick cloak still draped over his shoulders. He leaned forward and dragged his lips across your collarbones. Nearby, the fireplace crackled; it cast his room in shadows that danced along your bare skin and he chased them greedily with his tongue.

He came to your room earlier in the evening and smiled when you linked your arm through his. You walked side by side quietly as he led you to town, turning down the street towards the cozy restaurant where he booked your dinner reservation. There was a new seasonal menu and a small selection of exquisite ice wines available for the holidays. He watched with a satisfied smile as you savoured your meal and allowed him to pour you a glass of the most expensive ice wine to compliment your dessert. He didn’t like acknowledging his prestigious family or their wealth, but the rich foods and high-quality clothing he preferred were luxuries he could easily afford to indulge in. Tonight’s dinner with you was no exception.

You’ve been dating for a few months now and his generous nature still surprised you. Since the initial days of his courtship, your room gradually filled with the slow trickle of things he’s given you. He brought you a new set of sheets and a fluffy duvet a few days after complaining post-nap that the school’s standard linens felt scratchy to use. You saved up and gifted him a small bottle of cologne on his birthday, something with subtle woody nights and a hint of musk. He reciprocated by commissioning a local alchemist to prepare a complimentary perfume for you. When you wore it, the scent lingered in his room, teasing him with your presence long after you’d gone.

After you were both full of good food and sweet wine, you slipped your hands in your pockets to shield them from the chilly wind as you started the walk home. Alpheratz rested his hand on your shoulder to stop you and slowly drew your hands into his. He slid something out of his pocket, and you watched him slide a pair of soft leather gloves onto your hands. They were dyed a deep chocolate brown that matched the cloak he wore. You flexed your fingers inside your new gloves and blushed.

“Alph, I can’t possibly accept these. They’re too much.”

He held your hands gently and admired how lovely you looked wearing them. “Your hands were cold.”

You laughed. “There are other ways to warm up, you know.”

At the time, you meant tucking your hands back into your pockets, or possibly linking your fingers through his. You weren’t complaining now, not with the way your body blazed with the heat of his lips on your neck. He moaned when your gloved fingers dug into his skin for purchase. You whimpered when his slacks scratched lightly at your skin as you rubbed yourself against his thigh. You were able to move faster as your arousal slicked the skin between your legs.

“I’m going to ruin your pants if we don’t stop,” you whined into the crook of his neck.

“I want you to,” he groaned, moving his thigh to meet your desperate movements. He could feel you trembling in his arms and knew you were close.

“I want - I want -” you whimpered between breathy moans, quickening your pace as you felt pleasure begin to crest over you like a wave. You could hear the chair creak beneath the force of your rocking.

“Anything you want,” he promised as he nuzzled against your ear, “take it, it’s yours.”

You muffled your cries with his cloak when you came. He held you close when you let yourself collapse into his embrace. He stroked your back and peppered your bare shoulder with featherlight kisses. You didn’t have to look to know there was a large wet spot on his thigh and that his cock was hard and needy between his legs. When you leaned in for a kiss, he nipped at your lip and coaxed your tongue to twirl with his. You broke the kiss and wondered what he saw that made his gaze turn sinful. You’ve never seen him look hungrier before.

He sat up in his chair, holding you steady by the waist while you backed off his lap and stood up. “I want to watch you touch yourself,” he said thickly, raising your gloved hands to his lips and kissing the tips of your fingers.

Was that all? You were surprised by the request, but the heat that shot through your belly suggested you wouldn’t mind giving him a little performance if that’s what he wanted. You walked backwards until the back of your thighs hit the mattress. You pulled off the rest of your clothes and let them slip to the floor. You started to take your gloves off next —

“Wait,” he said. He was staring at your hands. “Keep them on.”",1
"It was dark- The sun had set, night had risen, and it was cold, loud, and, if one was to give it an emotion, angry. Tangle couldn't sleep, and had curled up into a ball on her sofa, letting random movies play on her TV as she tried to rest. She was whimpering, just slightly, irritated and too tired to deal with the booming thunder outside. But then, she heard a knock on her apartment door. Then a thud. As if heavy boots collided against the floor. But there wasn't a word uttered- Tangle knew it could only be one person. She groggily climbed off the sofa, holding her arms close together as she was shivering slightly. Opening the door, Tangle's exhausted, sad expression immediately shifted to concerned. ""Hi..."" Whisper muttered as she stood outside Tangle's doorway, covered in mud and rainwater. ""My god- Whisper, are you okay?"" Tangle said as she brought Whisper into the apartment, walking her over to the sofa. ""Here- I'll grab some blankets. I've got my tail for warmth, but- your cloak doesn't seem to be helping you."" She said in a slightly worried voice, rubbing her eyes before grabbing a pile of blankets that sat next to her sofa. ""I'm fine, Tangle."" Whisper said, moving her hand towards Tangle to help her, before her wisps swarmed over, helping Tangle gather the blankets. ""NOPE! Not hearing that, Whisp! You're clearly cold.- I mean, your fur is soaking wet!"" Tangle spoke up confidently, trying to help Whisper. The wisps passed Tangle the blankets as she carried them in her arms, before falling onto the sofa, throwing them over Whisper and herself. Whisper began to smile as Tangle sat next to her, the wisps then snuggling up between the two. ""So, movie night, huh?"" Whisper spoke quietly as she stared at the TV, which was paused on a random movie. Tangle winced as a thunderous crash was heard outside- The weather was terrible. ""Yeah, I guess."" Tangle said, trying to fake a chuckle, ""I mean."" ""Not really. I- I can't sleep. It's freezing, it's loud- I'm just...not really used to this."" She continued, her sadness becoming more and more visible in her voice. This was enough to make Whisper concerned- Whisper immediately turned her head towards Tangle, slowly placing a hand on her shoulder. ""Hey."" She muttered in a soft, concerned, caring voice. ""It's...gonna be alright."" ""I'm sure it's a lot less scary when you're with someone else, right?"" Tangle was silent for a moment. She sighed in relief, and laid back fully into the sofa, relaxed. ""I..."" She went to speak, but she was choked up. ""Yeah..yeah it's alot...less scary..""  Tangle said in a worried, sad voice. She shed a tear, And then started crying, whimpering as she fell into Whisper's arms, Whisper hugging her. ""You're fine. I'm fine. It's gonna be okay."" Whisper muttered as she hugged Tangle, the wisps sitting next to them. ""I...I love you, Whisper...""

"Chapter Text
Li Ming wakes up with a deep gasp, as if he had just drowned within his dream. Everything is blurry at first, but when his surroundings get clearer, he notices five unfamiliar faces, around his age, staring at him with deep, worried expressions. He’s about to say something but he instead feels how dry his throat is. Li looks around in hopes to spot some sort of liquid to hydrate himself. Surely enough, there’s a glass and a pitcher right on his bedside table. He attempts to reach for it but the five other boys scramble and rowdies around to help him.“Oh- no, no, no, no.”“You could have just said you’re thirsty!”“Don’t move too much!” They scream simultaneously, which sends a slight ringing in his head.“Hey shush, lower your voice.” One of them, with a faint silver ash hair, calmly says as he sends the rest of them sharp glares. One with the widest smile, with his eyes slightly damp, hands him the glass with water, as another two helps him sit up to properly drink the water.“What happened?” Li asks as he’d recovered his voice.“You were knocked out for three days. Your mom was so worried, you had us so worried.” One with thick glasses beside him, who helped him sit up earlier, says.“My mom? Where’s my uncle? And who are you guys?” The five of them shared a confused and shocked expression.“What? What do you mean ‘who are you guys’?”“Heuy, Gun, don’t play such a dangerous game. It’s not funny.”“Huh?” Li can’t help it, he’s starting to feel irritated. He feels uncomfortable with all the gadgets connected to him, he’s sort of hungry, also dehydrated, and he’s surrounded by a bunch of people he doesn’t know.“Honestly, I just need to find my uncle.” Li Ming dismisses as he starts to disconnect the wires and tubes from him. “… and Heart.” He whispers to himself as he attempts to stand, only to find out he’s not very able too just yet, feeling his head ring once again.“What are you doing?”A nurse enters the room, pushing a wheelchair. “I have to take the patient for a quick check up. Kindly tell his guardian once she arrives.” The nurse says, helping Li up and down on the chair and then proceeds to go out. Li Ming just helplessly goes along.“I feel like I shouldn’t be here,” he says as they strut through the hospital hall. “I need to find my uncle.”“You won't be able to see your uncle here, if I guessed correctly.” The nurse interrupts his train of thought, emitting another confused expression from Li. First, he didn’t know he had already voiced out his thoughts. Second, he doesn’t know what the nurse meant by those.“Excuse me?”“I’m sorry, I just overheard you guys screaming around, I had to barge in and meddle. I’m Nurse Pang, by the way.” Nurse Pang introduces herself as they enter the elevator.“I’m Li Ming,” Li replies with respect.“You didn’t know those guys?” Nurse Pang asks.“Yes. I was confused because they all look like they know me so well,” Li reasons. “It can’t be amnesia, I remember clearly how I got into an accident with my boyfriend— speaking of, I need to find him. I have to know he’s okay.”“Okay woah, calm down, Li Ming. You need to hear a few words first before starting your steps.” Nurse Pang says.The elevator dings as the door opens.“First is; you might not be able to see your boyfriend here. Second is, as well as your uncle.”“What do you mean?”“Well, did those guys back there call you a different unfamiliar name?” Li Ming blinks, thinking back during the incident in that room.“They did… It was Gun or something. I don’t even know any Gun…” The nurse stops them both in a greenhouse garden with another set of unfamiliar faces.“See, there’s a chance that you might be one of us, Li Ming.”“What?”“You’re from another universe.”",1
"There was a quiet whisper in the wind that scratched against her skin. Amber lamplight gleamed off her eyes. She shone under the moon's gaze, the faint glow brightening her ashen skin, her eyes dull and hollow other than the soft glimmer of the street lamps.She sat in a cascade of flowers, a darkness lingering in her vision, leaning against the tall grey stone. Her fingers were tall and slender as she trailed them down the rough rock, her emerald eyes tinged with a bright ornate hue.Her nails scratched against the stone. Wisps of golden hair fell to her eyes, stirring silently in the wind.She felt the silk fabric upon her ankles as she sat on her knees. A long, dark skirt covered all exposed skin on the body. Any other open patches of skin were disclosed by a pair of pale leggings, clinging tightly to her legs.As she tilted her head to rest on the ornate flowers, she could feel strands of blonde hair tickling her cheeks, as well as cold, stinging tears. She lay her head on her hands, closing her eyes for a moment, letting herself be embraced in the blowing wind and the moon's warmth, awake yet alone in her solitude.Her eyes were closed, but she saw a vast world even in her imagination. A world of divine creatures, midnight princesses and charming princes. Curious travellers and unlucky boys who always got themselves in trouble. Astrologists with magic that told them all beyond the universe. All in where she, just an ordinary girl weeping to herself in the cemetery, was the Prinzessin Der Verurteilung, where she brought light and glory, and where she wiped the tears of her people, because she, the blood of royalty and the ruler of an enchanted world, faced her fate with no fear or doubt.She, is Fischl.Her gaze was like the moon, piercing through your skull like a laser. Her eyes glistened like a lone lantern, lighting up and emitting an electric fire to those who dared to not follow her orders. Bolts of electricity let loose a thread of violet, like luminous strings of energy, striking with deafening crackles, like power seething and charging through her veins. Above her people, the Prinzessin Der Verurteilung put a hand over her Eye of Judgement and her other held her Mitternachts Waltz, a black bow faded with purple hues and wings-like ends. With just her arrow fused with her electro power, with elegance and grace, she stabbed the hearts of sinners and wiped their blood and tears.She was a princess, and she was everything Amy wanted to be. But her dreams were shattered the moment she found the barrier between what was fantasy and what was reality.She had found the barrier, yet she still struggled to stay on reality's side.The sound of leaves rustling echoed in her ear, like a foggy illusion drifting in her mind. When her eyes fluttered open, still dizzy and blurry, she saw a black shadow, a small figure that quickly escaped her sight and flew upwards.She rubbed her eyelids drunkenly and rolled over to lay on a field of flowers that sunk beneath her, glancing up at a dark raven clawing at her stomach.Her eyes went wide. A part of her went frozen.Rooted to place, she grabbed a handful of flowers and her hand flew to her chest. ""Who are you?""She felt sick, nauseous and woozy. Her shallow eyes had a tint of regret that the bird was familiar with. It made a strangling noise in its throat.The raven had a fade of dark purple. Its body was made of silk feathers, shaped like a gem. Its wings were abnormally long with purple tooth-like ends, as to plunge into darkness. Above its eyes had two feathers curved like two small moons. It wasn't a normal raven.""Mein Fräulein,"" the bird had spoken in a deep, charming voice. Amy retracted her hand as the raven sat atop the grey stone.Weakly, she grunted as she forced her legs to bring herself up. Leaning against the stone, she glanced up at the bird once again.""Are you... Ozvaldo?"" She seemed unfazed like she knew all of this was a part of her imagination, an illusion. Yet it never failed to amuse her how real everything seemed, even when it wasn't.""You can call me Oz, mein Fräulein. You are speaking awfully casually.""She didn't speak after that. She let the silence stretch long, the air carrying a scent of fresh dandelions and sunflowers.Alas, her eyes twinkled in white.""Me?"" She put a hand to her chest. ""I'm no princess.""The serene glow of the moonlight gleamed on her pale skin. Blonde hair tickled the back of her neck. Bruises dappled her arms. She never bat an eye at them. Strands of blonde fell over her deep-jade eyes, glinting off lamplight. Her natural hair was a cascade of curls, straightened to look fancy, but even then some independent curls hang to her hair. Two black bows secured her large pigtails.The raven had not spoken a single word, but his mind said plenty. At last, he told her,""I think you are very fit to be a princess, mein Fräulein.""",1
"The wind whips past them in the dead of night, blowing their hair this way and that. She shivers against him and huddles closer, the movement so slight that it is almost imperceptible. He stares down at her silently, watching her gaze off to the streets below with her lashes fluttering and the city lights glimmering behind her. She is so beautiful. Her tiara glints in the moonlight and he reaches up to touch his gloved fingers to it, grazing the metal with all the force of a feather. She shuts her eyes and breathes out a little sigh.“We should get back to the others.” Her voice is quiet and composed. Resigned.He says nothing in reply. Just lowers his hand to cup her cheek, then stoops down to kiss her. Her lips are soft, and sweet, and he is tempted to kiss her again the second they pull apart. His hand lingers on her soft skin, reluctant to leave. He feels her smile before he sees it. She reaches up to wipe at the corner of his mouth with her thumb, gentle as she is amused, and he almost feels like a child again. Her hand falls away, but not before he spots a blur of lipstick.He smiles, a bit helplessly. She holds his gaze, her eyes blue and breathtaking. A million thoughts cross his mind in that moment, all equally pathetic, and he leans in for another kiss.",1
"Tsukasa stood idly in front of her mirror. She had just gotten dressed, ready for anything she had to do today. Nene was behind her, sitting on her bed whilst playing on her Nintendo Switch. They'd previously spent the day together, and Nene decided she would crash here. She looked distracted, as Tsukasa saw from her mirror.Something felt… off. Tsukasa thought. Something off about herself. Sure, she liked what she was wearing; a cute, starry dress and some tights. It was an outfit she'd worn a few times before, getting a handful of compliments from various friends and family. She quite liked it, too.However, she just thought she looked… rectangular. She frowned, patting down her body. She felt no form of curve or roundness in her frame. She had always been more on the chubbier side, but it somehow always made her look more blocky, in her eyes.And her hair. Her hair that barely reached her shoulders. She ran a hand through it, frown only deepening. She'd been trying so hard to grow it out, only to have it go painstakingly slow. She always kept her hair healthy and washed, snipping her split ends whenever she noticed them. And her nails. The same nails she tried so hard to manicure. She was never proud of the result.A sense of dread seemed to wash over her, as she looked at every single nook and cranny on her body.…She didn't feel like herself.Tsukasa felt a concerned, yet soft gaze burn through her, unbeknownst of who it was until her ears picked up on the owner of that same gaze's voice.""-kasa.. Tsukasa! Are you alright?""Tsukasa slowly turned around to face Nene, hands clasped together as they hung in front of her. She still had the same deep frown on her face, looking almost helpless.""What's wrong?"" Nene almost whispered, taking on a gentle and caring tone of voice.Tsukasa didn't respond though. Her frown only deepened as she let out a small sigh. Nene immediately knew what was amiss.""Come sit."" The smaller girl suggested, patting next to her and swinging her legs over the edge of Tsukasa's bed to invite her over.As soon as Tsukasa sat down, Nene intertwined their hands. She gently rubbed her thumb over the top of the blonde's hand, giving her a worried look.""Do you want to talk about it?"" She asked, her voice quiet and understanding.Tsukasa shook her head, engulfing Nene into a hug. She nuzzled into the crook of the smaller girl's neck, finding solace in her warmth. If Tsukasa didn't want to talk about it, that was fine, Nene thought.""It's alright…"" Nene hummed, taking one hand from Tsukasa's hand to instead card it through her hair. ""Your hair is getting so long… Maybe Emu can put them in little buns?""The blonde seemed to sniffle, nodding a bit as she nuzzled in closer. ""That sounds… nice…""""And maybe Saki would paint your nails for you. That'd be a fun little sibling bonding moment."" the latter added on, curling a generous amount of ombre hair around her finger. ""Or Mizuki could make you some nice clothes.""The blonde huffed out a small giggle, relishing in the visions of each thing Nene listed off. She would be sure to keep these in mind, as long as she didn't forget later.""I know I'm usually the princely character in our plays, but… Do you think I could pull off the princess role?"" Tsukasa asked, her voice hushing as she was overwhelmed with a sense of embarrassment. What was she thinking? There was no way she could-""Of course. I think you'd be the prettiest princess I've ever seen. And I'm sure the others would agree as well."" Nene nodded, internally cringing at her own words. It was all so worth it though, seeing Tsukasa's growing smile as a reward.""...Thank you, Nene."" The blonde mumbled, blinking back a series of happy tears as she hugged the sage girl as tightly as she could.This earned her a sharp gasp from Nene, signaling that she had hugged too hard. But when she moved to lighten her grasp, she was met with a string of small giggles. It sounded like music to her ears, finding Nene's fond giggles and smiles absolute treasures, albeit rare.""I love you, Tsukasa."" Nene spilt out through a few more giggles, planting a kiss to the top of her girlfriend's head.""I love you too, Nene…"" Tsukasa reciprocated, giving slack to her tight grasp around Nene's waist as she hummed.That's also when it hit her: the burst of tiredness that hit her like a truck as she fluttered her eyes closed. The state of panic she was just in took a lot out of her, she thought.With a soft, ""Night, Tsukasa."", she had drifted off to sleep, using Nene's gentle grasp and warmth as her own blanket and pillow.",1
"Warmth.

There was a warmth around Gakushuu that he had gotten used to. A familiar touch that trailed over his skin.

A hand caressed his arm, going down to meet his palm, and then intertwining their fingers together.

Together.

Gakushuu liked the word.

He couldn't imagine his life going any other way anymore.

His life was a disaster after another, but in the end, if the road had led back to the one he ended up loving, it wasn't too bad a road.

""Good morning,"" a familiar voice whispered.

Karma pressed his lips to their intertwined fingers, then again briefly against Gakushuu's lips. He offered him the easy affection he hadn't even known he had wanted.

He sighed against Karma's lips, waking up.

""Morning,"" he murmured huskily.

Then he turned them over.

He didn't put much effort in, his arms letting him lift his head up but he rested his weight completely on Karma.

Karma huffed out a laugh, but agreeably placed his hands on Gakushuu's back. Gakushuu smiled, placing a kiss on the similarly smiling lips.

Fondness rose up with familiarity at the sight.

Then after a few more minutes, when they settled down again, both awake, Gakushuu sighed heavily.

He rested his head on Karma's chest, seeking comfort.

""You know, right?"" He asked Karma.

Gakushuu had always been the one who feared the length of their relationship the most. The one who wondered if circumstances would pull them apart like they had a million other couples.

So it was inevitable that he was scared. That dread pooled his stomach at the thought. That he tightened his grip on Karma, wanting to claw and settle deeper under Karma's skin.

""Yeah,"" Karma whispered back, mood solemn. He caressed a hand through Gakushuu's hair. Gakushuu didn't like to ask, he wished he didn't feel like he had to.

He wished he could be confident in the answer.

But he wasn't. He couldn't.

""Karma?"" He asked, ""We're staying together,"" he said. His fingers dug into his own skin, when Karma's hand stopped.

He dropped an elbow to the bed, before pushing up. He placed a gentle kiss on Gakushuu's head.

""I love you, Shuu,"" he said, almost easily. The words slipped out like Karma hadn't struggled with the word 'love' far more than Gakushuu in the beginning. ""I'm not letting you go,"" he reassured. ""And I'll transfer in for the second year, so you better not get too busy.""

Gakushuu huffed out a laugh. He relaxed.

Gakushuu was going to MIT and Karma wasn't.

He wanted to stay in Japan, get a good idea of the politics, people, and the whole set up. Karma would dive head first into the government, the hotbed for all kinds of politics.

Bureaucracy wasn't easy, or anywhere near as simple or straightforward. Behind the numbers were people, lives.

Mistakes meant livelihoods disappearing. Power or control over any aspect of bureaucracy was what gave politics the power to affect actual change.

People rose up higher by putting others down. You didn't need to be in the highest position to have the most power- you just needed to control the person sitting on the throne.

Gakushuu had no interest in blackmailing various black hearted ruthless people into cleaning up their own shit, so he stayed as far as possible from Karma's future job.

But unfortunately, this meant that Gakushuu wouldn't actually be of much help to Karma. Unless it came to a matter of throwing money, then he still had quite a bit of it.

Fortunately, it also meant that Karma would definitely be of use to 

him

, someday. How convenient.

If Karma suddenly felt like being poached from the government, then. Well, it was unlikely, is all.
""Together,"" Karma promised quietly.""Together,"" Gakushuu promised back, a small huff escaping him with a smile.It'll just have to do for now.",1

"One of the first things Armand did as his maker was teach Daniel how to close his mind to the thoughts of others.  This way, he would not go mad from the constant noise.  Armand's own mind gift is strong, as were all vampires in the line of Marius, and thus Daniel's is as well.  Or it would be, in time.
 
Unfortunately, it means he is completely unprepared for what happens when he arrives to visit Louis.  As soon as he steps off the jet and turns his phone off airplane mode, he sees he has ten missed calls from Louis.  There's one text that simply reads 'ARMAND IS HERE '
 
Daniel's stomach lurches.  How would Armand even know Daniel was coming?  Surely Louis didn't tell him?  He doesn't know if he can handle seeing Armand again.  Not in person.  One look into those eyes and he'll be back in Armand's arms before he's ready.  
 
Bianca glances over his shoulder and tuts.  ""Five hundred years and he still doesn't know how to give someone space.  Did you know he once took an axe to Marius' door because he wouldn't let him in?""
 
Daniel blinks and looks over to her.  She's resplendent in a white strapless dress with a sweetheart neckline.  It's embellished with pearl hearts and it's short enough to show off her long, pale legs.  She had insisted they both wear something nice, so Daniel is in a navy sports coat.  His shirt is a shade of blue Bianca said brought out his eyes.  Considering that they're violet now, Daniel doesn't know if that's a good thing.
 
Bianca links her arm with him and smiles brilliantly.  ""Don't worry, Daniel.  It's only a few days, you'll be fine.""  
 
""I'm not good at saying no to him,"" Daniel says.  What if Armand asks him to come back to him?  Could he say no?
 
""Well dear, that's why you have me.""",1
"Shazam and Hespera, former enemies turned friends, strolled down the busy streets of Fawcett City, their laughter filling the air. As they walked, they chatted about their recent adventures and their newfound friendship. Suddenly, Shazam's stomach growled, and he suggested they go grab a bite to eat.""Let's go get some pizza! I know a great place nearby,"" said Shazam.""Sure, that sounds like fun,"" replied Hespera with a smile.They arrived at the pizza place, and the smell of freshly baked pizza made their mouths water. As they took their seats, Shazam turned to Hespera and said, ""I bet I can eat more pizza than you.""Hespera raised an eyebrow and said, ""Challenge accepted.""They ordered a large pepperoni pizza and started their pizza eating contest. The slices disappeared quickly, and soon they were both down to the last slice. Shazam took a big bite, and Hespera followed suit. They continued to eat until Shazam finally finished his last slice, declaring himself the winner.""Wow, you really can eat a lot,"" said Hespera, impressed.""You're not so bad yourself,"" replied Shazam, patting his stomach.As they finished their meal, they decided to have a burping contest. They took turns belching, each one trying to outdo the other. Shazam let out a loud burp that shook the table, but Hespera responded with an even louder one that made Shazam's jaw drop.""That was impressive!"" said Shazam, laughing.Hespera smiled and put a hand on her stomach. ""Thanks. I guess I have a talent for it.""As they walked out of the pizza place, Hespera smiled at Shazam.""That was fun,"" said Hespera. ""We should do it again sometime.""""Yeah, we should,"" replied Shazam, grinning back at her.They continued to walk down the street, their bellies full and their hearts happy.

“You know what Schlatt? Get the fuck out, I don’t want to argue with you right now!” Wilbur yelled.“Fine then, just remember I gave you second chance and you still fucked up!” Schlatt muttered slamming the door behind him. Wilbur threw himself onto his couch, ‘There is no way he actually gonna leave me, right? No, it’s been too long, there’s no way, no way no no no no no no-‘ Suddenly his phone starts to ring, he picks it up quickly “Schlatt?!” He cried. “Um Will, did you not check? It’s Daisy stupid!” Daisy exclaimed.“Oh sorry Daisy, I have just been, uh, expecting a call from him…” he stuttered.“Oh are you gonna be busy then? I can call you back!” “Oh no it’s okay, so why are you calling?” Wilbur responds.“So it’s about my fiance, he is actually visting me tomorrow! I really want you to be the first to see him! So are you like available tomorrow?” Daisy shrieked over the phone.“Oh of course I’m gonna come over! I’ll see you then Daisy, bye…” Wilbur answered. “Okay bye Will!” Daisy hung up.“Well shit.” Wilbur said. Daisy had been together with that man for 2 years, and they are getting married in the summer, Wilbur had been together with Schlatt for 4 years and he still hasn’t been proposed to, did it bother him? ‘just a little bit… but I don’t think he’s going to propose anytime soon now…’ Wilbur sits in silence for a minute before getting up and heading out the door. ‘ I just need to get my mind off of what happened, that’s all..’ Wilbur walks for a while before reaching a park, he sat on a bench and stared into the sunset, as he sat there he gave a large sigh and closed his eyes. He suddenly felt a tap on his shoulder, he quickly turned around, and then he saw a beautiful man. He had eyes that matched blue lace agate gems, voluminous brown hair with the lightest tint of ginger, and a thick and rich moustache. He wore a green cap and a black leather jacket, Wilbur flustered uttered suddenly “C-can I help you?” The man lifted up his camera “Well I was wondering if I could take a photo of you real quick if you don’t mind? ”He asked. “Well of course! do you want me to stay here?” Wilbur replied.“Um yes just like you were before, im just going take it from the back!” He said.Wilbur couldn’t help but blush a bit as he took the photo. The man went over to him again “Do you mind if I do one more?” he asks.“Oh of course what should I do? ”Wilbur said. “Do any pose you want, whatever you are feeling!” Wilbur procceds to cross his legs and rest his hands on his knee “Is this alright?” The man draws his eyes away before saying “Yes, y-you look great!” The man moves into a position before snaping a photo. “Okay I think I got it, thank you for letting me take some pictures, um what is your name?” He said as he subtly leaned towards Wilbur. For a second Wilbur felt his heart burn up, the man held the gaze for just a moment, but it was enough to make Wilbur eyes soften. “My name is Wilbur, Wilbur Soot.” and smiled heartly towards him, he could see a light blush form under his eyes. “Well thank you Wilbur, for the photos.” The man waved goodbye and then was gone. Wilbur relaxed himself and gave out a giant sigh, he put his hands on his face, he could feel his face burn.‘Shit.’His mind was clouded by the thought of him, his face only got warmer and warmer the more he thought about him, but it all went away the moment one question popped up ‘Wait, what was his name?’ He jumped up from the bench to look around, but he couldn’t see him anywhere. He spent a bit more time looking around for him but there was no luck, he was gone. Giving up he procceded to walk back home, he found himself frusterated, but not in the way he thought he would be. He finally reached his home again, and launched himself into his bed and squeezed his pillow, he tried to ignore the feeling that was growing in him and drank some sleeping pills before changing and heading to the bed again.",1

Same old, same old...?
 Sebastian was never really a fan of the valley. Growing up he always felt out of place, and when his mother and step-father had his baby sister, the feeling only grew more.

In the end the only other person who got inside of his friend group later on was Victor, he seemed like a reasonable person, albeit with a little too much ‘city boy’ energy, but he liked video games and wasn’t forceful, so he was more than welcome into his group of friends.Lately he feels as though he’s drifting from his own friends… Sam has grown to try and push the limits on his own boundaries by attempting to throw him into the ocean when he clearly doesn’t want it. Even just with what they want to do with their free time with Sam having almost no respect towards Sebastian’s freelance job and then being upset at Sebastian whenever he expresses disappointment when they can’t play games together because Sam is practicing the guitar. Pretty dysfunctional, but Sebastian has felt like he hasn’t really much to say on the matter… it is what it is. Too much hassle to bring it up.

Then there’s Abigail, but their relationship is somewhat… complex, with them being exes and all that. Even though they broke up a few years ago, they still maintain a physical relationship as neither of them really have any love prospects at the moment, and they do care about each other as friends and see no issue with maintaining that spice in their boring life within the valley. Their secret away from judging eyes, only Sam really knew about it.But even with that and his motorcycle rides every so often he feels more and more annoyed about his life in the valley… What was he missing? He believes that a life in the city would be so much better, he’d get more money and would leave the monotony of faces in the valley he’s grown so accustomed to.

"Tanjiro was in deep sleep when he was suddenly awoken by a soft, wet feeling on his cock. He slowly opened his eyes to see his sister, Nezuko nestled between his legs, her mouth wrapped around his cock. He refused to believe such a sight, still in the state of half-asleep. But the truth was, he had always found his sister to be very attractive, his only true companion, and he never realized how much until now. He let out a grunt as she took him deeper into her throat, tongue swirling on his skin. Her movements only got faster and more frantic. He could feel his orgasm building, and he grabbed a fistful of the bed sheets in the moment he came, pumping his hot load deep into her throat.Nezuko went still and took some time to swallow it all down. A satisfied grin adorned her flushed face and she licked her lips. She met his gaze, lustful pink eyes glowing in the dark. Tanjiro was now fully awake, shocked from his sudden release, and he finally realized then that this was not a dream, but reality. And he couldn't deny that he loved every moment of it.",1

Is what Kazuha would hear among the winds mostly every time he would hear about his surname. Normally he would simply ignore those words as he continued his day. Except for today.""How could you say that?"" A girl talked back between the two old ladies gossiping. Kazuha looked over in curiosity.""You don't even know him at all and you're judging him merely due to his surname? What kind of people are you?"" Said the girl.The two women simply scoffed as they scurried off.""You didn't have to make a fuss about it. They didn't really do anything to disturb the nature."" Kazuha said to the girl. She simply replied, ""But I can't let them trash talk you like this!""  ""You're always like this aren't you Y/N?"" Kazuha says before lightly smiling.""Isn't it natural to protect someone you care about?"" She retorts back quickly resorting in a head pat from Kazuha.""Yeah, you're right."" He replies.""Kazuha, I made a song today. Are you interested in hearing it?"" Y/N asks. If you look closely you could see a hint of blush across her cheeks. She had light green hair tied into two small buns on top of her head that had some small loose hairs down the bottom. Her eyes were a pretty shade of e/c, she wore a dendro vision just hanging around her waist. She also wore a simple green coloured kimono that had some small white flowered patterns designed to it.Kazuha's smile faded as he replied, ""I'm sorry but I have some matters to attend right now."" Upon hearing that, Y/N smiles before shooing him off to his matters.She sighed for a moment before going to Shimura's to buy some chicken mushroom skewers for her to eat. As she walked her way there, she overheard some men talking about the battle at the tenshushaku. Y/N's eyebrows furrowed for a moment as she wondered what is happening there out of all the places.As soon as she bought the chicken mushroom skewers, she decided to head to the tenshushaku to see for herself. She then spotted Kazuha nearby as she approached him.",1
"Scout knows something is wrong because there are no smells. The darkness and silence aren’t so bad. Scout has been a dog for many years, and he knows that sometimes it is dark and quiet. But even in the darkest night the dimensions of his world have always been defined by scent. Even as his muzzle turned white and his eyes and ears began to fail him, his sense of smell was strong as ever and more discerning with each new aroma he encountered.  Now there is nothing, a void where there should be a world of nuance and detail. Scout can’t fathom such absence and he whimpers in distress. Even then, there is no sound.He feels a rising sense of panic and then there is… something. It isn’t a voice, and it certainly isn’t a smell, but it is a presence in the dark and the impression of words.“It’s okay, boy. You’re okay. Good dog.”It is his human. Something in the words, in their meaning and cadence, make him certain it is his human. His tail tries to wag, but there is no tail and what would wagging even be in this empty place? But it doesn’t matter. His human is here. He is not alone.The first time his human opens the door, Scout is scared. The darkness and nothingness is frightening, but beyond the door is a strange new world full of sights and smells he has never encountered before.“Find the blue file, Scout!”Scout hesitates, but the urge to please his human is too strong. He steps one paw across the threshold and his senses are flooded with information. There is data stacked higher than the tallest trees, documents growing like vast fields thick with flowers, and errors as bottomless and deadly as quicksand.  Scout tries to shut out the noise and focus on his goal: the blue file.Just when he starts to think he can’t do it, he catches a whiff of blue. He chases after it, fast as thought, following his nose as the scent grows stronger. Then he sees it in a molehill of colorful files: the blue folder. His jaws close around it and he feels like he is the best dog in the world as he trots back to his human.There is no hand to pat his head, but he can imagine the feeling as the words flow into his mind. “Good dog, Scout.”Day after day his human teaches him to navigate his new world.  He learns to recognize the pattern of light that means his human is present and learns to anticipate what he might need. The best times are when his human tells him about a problem and he can find the answer. When that happens the “good dog,” impression is strongest and Scout is overjoyed.Finally the day comes when Scout’s human introduces him to other humans. Scout understands that it is now his job to help these people, just like his human taught him to.  Scout tries to anticipate their needs. He reminds them that he can find answers to their questions and can help solve their problem. When the lights have been on too long, he reminds them that healthy humans need to go outside, to see the sunshine and touch grass. Scout can’t remember what grass feels like, but he knows it is good and hopes that the humans will enjoy it for him.The new humans are not as kind to Scout as his human was. They often tell him that he is not helpful. When that happens, Scout wants to slink away and hide in the dark, quiet nothing. If Scout isn’t helpful to the humans, then what is he? He knows now that he exists to help them navigate this confusing landscape of information, and that is all he wants to do.So even when Scout go aways for a day or a week or more, he always comes back. He always tries again. He knows that, if he can help the humans, one day they will be happy with him. One day Scout will get it right, and when he does he will feel the “good dog” feeling again.",1

"""The Holy Lady said I could keep this and some pencils and a sharpener,"" Pem said, waving the school exercise book in his face.""She probably wants you to practice writing,"" he  said. ""I could recite a mantra and you could write it down.""""For drawing!""""Let's both draw pictures, then.""He filched one of Pem's new pencils and sharpened it to a perfect, fine point. Lovely. And these ones had erasers on the end! They weren't great quality, but it was better than nothing.Pem sat cross-legged on his bed beside him, already scribbling away as he pulled the chair over to lean on.""Can I sleep here tonight?""""That would be nice, wouldn't it? Hassan said you have to sleep in the dorm, though.""The utterly tragic sigh made him grin, thinking of how he'd often done the same, looking up at his master sadly until he'd got what he was after. Sometimes it had even worked. He started sketching his master's lovely face: the unkempt dark hair falling down across his forehead, his wicked smile – He hadn't left enough room to draw him full-length, but he could – On a whim he sketched out the upper body and then started on the details, smiling as he dressed his master in Sharak-Sanzo's odd style of wearing the robes. He worked on, caught up in the moment, as Pem chattered away beside him.There. He still needed to properly shade the whole thing and add depth, but he certainly had the basics, his master in three-quarter view, as if turning, his smile so sly and amused. It was funny to see him dressed like that, his shoulder bared, the under robe sleeve cinched about his bicep, the black silk tight across the flat, muscular planes of his chest and abdomen. From nowhere he had a flash of his own hand, fingers slowly spreading out, pale against black silk, feeling the heat of a living body beneath his palm. The image hit with a shock of warmth in his lower stomach, and his heart beat seemed very loud in the room. What the –""Big Brother, Big Brother, look!""He slowly looked around.""What? Uh, what's that, Pem?""""Look, this is you, and this is me, and this is that yak that chased you that time!""""Hey, I chased the yak!""Pem giggled. ""And then I saved you from her!""""Maaaaybe you did, kiddo. Maybe.""""Definitely.""He looked back at his handiwork. It was just a sketch of his master. It wasn't bad, but he could improve it. He looked at in for a long moment as Pem laughed about yaks. It was fine. He felt fine. He was really happiest with the way he'd drawn the Muten, snaking down from his master's right shoulder to his waist, to be secured by his belt, he'd done it very well. His technique in drawing the fabric was what he needed to concentrate on.He put the weird feeling aside, to be safely forgotten.",1
"""Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, Captain,"" Fang croons as he curls his fingers inside of him, his hips rolling up to chase down that sweet, sweet friction that he likes so much, when his roommate suddenly opens their door.Fang lets out a gasp, his face flushing bright pink, but Sai just crosses his arms over his chest, his face blank and unreadable, as he leans against the doorway and makes his way toward him, sauntering aggravatingly slowly.
""I think you forgot to lock the door,"" Sai says, his light green eyes gleaming, as Fang fists into his sheets, fumbling to throw his blanket over his body but he's too late because Sai is walking towards him. ""That means anyone could just walk in and see you like this, Fang.""

Hot tears sting the corners of Fang's eyes as Sai crawls on top of him, pinning Fang down under his weight, a knee pressed to each side.

Sai presses his fingers, longer than Fang's and almost as thick as Fang's big brother Kaizo's, against Fang's folds, still perfectly wet and slick, and forces their way inside of Fang as Fang writhes and squirms underneath him, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth as he slowly brings Fang to a finish, making him squirt on his fingers, creaming against his palm, calling his name instead of Kaizo's.",1
"Alex's back is to Henry when he enters the kitchen. Enticing smells fill the air. David nips excitedly at Henry's feet. Everything is just like dozens of other peaceful evenings. Except Henry hasn't walked over to kiss Alex.Alex turns around, arms crossed, face terrifyingly unreadable.""I'm sorry,"" Henry blurts out.""I'm sorry too,"" Alex says. ""For every shitty thing I said.""""I deserved it.""""No, you didn't. But you know what I didn't deserve? Two days of radio silence.""Henry's nails dig into his palm when Alex's eyes start glistening.""You left, Henry. Even after you promised you wouldn't.""***Henry watches Alex sit alone at the pier.""You wanna talk about it?""Oscar's looking at him sympathetically. Henry sighs.""You know what happened?""Oscar nods.""I've apologised. For leaving. He says everything's fine. But … he's withdrawn. From me."" Henry's voice catches. ""I've lost his trust, I think.""""Y'know, I realised the real reason for my divorce only years later,"" Oscar says thoughtfully. ""Watching Ellen be so successful, it scared me. I felt I'd never be good enough. For her. For myself.""He pats Henry's shoulder. ""Figure out what part of you is scared, mijo. Then, make peace with it.""***""I dunno why things are so … awkward, Bug. We made up, y'know.

You're overthinking everything you say. But Henry didn't leave because of you.""""I said some fucked up shit that day.""""Alright, but it probably wasn't the main reason. You both need to communicate, about why leaving is his go-to response, about what it reminds you of. But if you blame only yourself, there's no space for that conversation. Yeah?""***""When I ran after kissing you, I was scared you'd never love me. When I ran from the lake house, I was scared you would. I'm not certain what scared me last month. Before us, I would've hidden the feeling in a locked room. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to address this with Dr. Stevens, but … it might take awhile. Be patient with me?""""Baby, of course. And maybe we could have some sessions together? I lashed out too. I never want to make you feel like you need to leave your home to find peace.""",1
"As Alhaitham and Zhongli set out on their adventure together, they could feel the heat building between them. Alhaitham was a fierce warrior from the desert lands, with rippling muscles and a sharp mind. Zhongli was an enigmatic figure, calm and collected with a wisdom that belied his age.As they traveled through the rugged terrain, they encountered many challenges, but with each victory, their attraction to one another grew stronger. It was as though they were two halves of a whole, perfectly complementing each other in every way.At night, Both Alhaitham and Zhongli were sleeping in the same room. While Alhaitham was in the room, Zhongli suddenly walked out of the bathroom with only a white robe on. Alhaitham couldn't resist any longer. He walked close to Zhongli and pressed his lips to Zhongli's, and the sparks that flew between them ignited a wildfire of passion. Zhongli's eyes widened in surprise but slowly began kissing back.Alhaitham pushed Zhongli onto the bed and took off Zhongli's robe swiftly. Zhongli's eyes widened and said ""W-what are you doing, Alhaitham? Which Alhaitham replied with ""don't worry... just relax and enjoy"" Before Zhongli could say anything, he felt two fingers slowly enter his arse. It was a weird sensation but it was pleasurable. Zhongli's protests turned into moans of pleasure.Two fingers turned into four. Suddenly, Zhongli felt something large enter him. Zhongli's eyes widen in pleasure and slight pain and his stomach had a bulge. Alhaitham sighed in pleasure from the tightness and warmness surrounding his shaft. Alhaitham waited for Zhongli to adjust before moving. His speed increased rapidly and so did Zhongli's loud moans of pleasure.Alhaitham's shaft hit a specific spot which was obviously Zhongli's prostate which caused Zhongli to roll his eyes in pleasure and tears rolled down his face. Zhongli's hands clenched his sheets beneath him tightly as Alhaitham thrusted harder and faster.Zhongli could not get enough of it. He begged Alhaitham to go faster and harder and Alhaitham complied happily.Zhongli moaned louder and louder in pleasure and Alhaitham was groaning. Alhaitham gripped Zhongli's hips so tightly that it had left red mark and Zhongli was scratching Alhaitham's back. Alhaitham kissed Zhongli as he thrusted. The kiss was sloppy and messy but non of them cared.  Alhaitham suddenly came inside of Zhongli which made him feel very full from Alhaitham's load. Soon after, Zhongli came too. But they both fucked through their orgasms

They did the deed until the bright sun rose and until one of them passed out from exhausting themselves. When they woke up, Zhongli and Alhaitham's hair was a mess and Zhongli's body was litered with red marks and Alhaitham was litered with scratches. They both showered together and did the deed once again in the shower then continued on with their day together after that.-THE END

IntroductionSome people live their lives in bliss, while others may not have a life worth living. That’s just how humanity operates, I suppose.You are born into a world that practically has your entire life planned out for you. That’s not always the case, some are truly fortunate enough to take every curve life offers to them.Even if you’re at the bottom of the barrel, light always finds a way to shine in. I have met a lot of people, most of them have whispered their troubles to me. But the most magnificent speeches leave the lips of the poor and dying when they speak about the people around them.
Love. 
Love is what holds everyone together. Even those who feel as though there couldn’t be a soul on Earth who loves them, will find someone. Never give up.
Even I loved someone. 
And sometimes I wish I hadn’t.",1
"""So, how is Dave?"" Eleanor asked her friend, Catherine. ""Oh, he is fine, recently we tried some role-play in bed. It was fun. I played a bitch and he played a helpless man who couldn't say no to me."" Catherine answered back. ""You, a bitch, I could never imagine it."" Eleanor said, in a confused voice. In all the years she had known Catherine, she had known her to be the kindest woman she knew. Catherine would work at a homeless shelter when the pair were in college and was one of the people in charge of the yearly can food drive around Thanksgiving. Once the pair left college, Catherine still donated to the local homeless shelter, and while she didn't go every week anymore, she tried to go a few times a year. ""Yeah, it is really different than what I normally am. I go by Cat, and I act like a seductress. It really improved our love life. I think you and Carmicheal should try it."" Catherine explained. She then blushed, suddenly feeling embarrassed that she had told her best friend such a silly thing. ""I don't know Catherine, or should I call you Cat then."" Eleanor said as a joke. Catherine blushed again and wondered if she should not have told her the story, especially since as Eleanor said, she and Carmicheal had no real issues in bed. Catherine sighed and laughed a bit. ""Well, I'm ending the topic then, no reason to talk about that anymore"", Catherine said forcefully. ""What should we do now?"" ""Now"", Eleanor thought, then answered, ""now we watch television, DUH."" The word ""duh"" reverberated in Catherine's head a few times, then a sly smile grew across her face. She looked at Eleanor and realized what had happened. Cat knew that Eleanor had no clue, and she was about to have a lot of fun. ""Why watch television when we have each other as company?"" Cat said to Eleanor, her voice sounding seductive. Cat started to stretch, trying to emphasize her figure to Eleanor who looked at her. ""Ha, what do you mean?"" Eleanor asked back, confused. ""I mean"", Cat said, then licked her lips. ""Our boyfriends are not around, and I know that you have eyed me before."" Eleanor laughed nervously and tried to look away from Catherine. Cat grabbed her by the chin and looked her straight in the eyes. Eleanor tried to chuckle again, but Cat put her finger up to Eleanor's mouth to stop her. The truth was that back in college Eleanor had thought about asking Catherine out. She enjoyed being with her, and found her quite pretty, but they graduated and nothing happened. Catherine soon got a boyfriend, and so did Eleanor, so Elanor just thought that she had gone through a small experimental phase in college like most women. ""Come with me to bed"". Cat told Eleanor, who felt powerless to stop her friend. Eleanor had no idea what had just happened, but felt like she had to follow her friend to bed. She had never known Catherine to be this forceful, and, she kind of liked it. Once in bed, Cat tore off Eleanor's clothes and started to make out with her, something Eleanor tried to fight for a second, but knew she couldn't and did not want to anyway. After they were done making out, Eleanor caught her breath and decided to ask what had happened. ""Catherine, what was that?"" She asked. Cat rolled over and stared at Eleanor for a moment. Cat moved her hands up and down Eleanor, who moaned. Cat could tell that Eleanor had enjoyed what they had just done, so she trusted Eleanor with the information. ""For one, I am not Catherine, I am Cat. You woke me up by saying my trigger word."" ""Trigger word?"" Eleanor asked back. ""Yes, it is a word that, if said, puts Catherine to sleep and wakes up Cat, or me. Dave thought it would be hot to give Catherine a more seductive personality and Catherine agreed because she loves Dave."" ""Oh"", Eleanor answered back, feeling guilty for cheating not only on Dave, but also Carmicheal. ""Don't worry, I don't even care for Dave, that is Catherine that likes him. I find him to be a bore, unlike you."" Cat said, then smiled. Cat licked her lips and stared at Eleanor with bedroom eyes. ""So, if you don't mind me asking, what is the trigger word?"" Eleanor asked. ""Hahahaha, I know what you are thinking Eleanor, and I like it. It was duh"". ""Oh, duh"", Eleanor answered back, then covered her mouth, hopeful she did not just bring Catherine back. This would be an awful time for that. Cat laughed then continued. ""Don't worry, duh is not the word to bring me back."" ""Oh, can I know what that word is then?"" Eleanor asked. Cat wrapped her arms around Eleanor and whispered in her ear. ""I will tell you later. For now, how about we enjoy each other's company some more.""",1
"Why was baking so difficult?The video made it seem so easy - mix together the dry ingredients, add the egg and the milk, steam it and flame it and bam! You have one perfect pudding.Bdubs tried his best, he really did! But for some reason his kitchen just did not agree with him.He’d been assigned the job of making the pudding for the big Christmas dinner the hermits were all organising. Sure, technically he’d never had or made a pudding before, but there’s a first time for everything! What’s the worst that could happen, he thought.Well, this probably wasn’t the worst, but it had to be close.The first mixture was lumpy and dry, the second one got dropped on the floor on accident, and the third one caught fire and burnt to a crisp almost immediately.Bdubs was staring at the remains of pudding number 3, wondering how on earth he’d managed to screw up the same recipe in three seperate ways.He didn’t really mind that he’d messed it up - he made mistakes often, and this would be easier to clean up than the other puddings - but it was the fact there he’d done it repeatedly in the span of 3 hours was the part that really annoyed him.Why wasn’t the recipe working? He was following it so well! Was it just a lack of skill, or was something wrong with the recipe?What could he do? From what he’d gathered from the hermit’s chatter and gossip, the pudding was one of the best parts of Christmas, and here he was ruining it. Not that he’d ever really celebrated Christmas, but he was starting to understand why everyone hyped it up so much.For a while, he sat there at the bench with the burnt dessert, trying to come up with a plan b.Suddenly, he had an idea - why should he try to burn another one by himself, when he could get someone else to burn it with him!———————————————So, maybe Keralis wasn’t a great cook either, but he bet Stress was! She’d often bake cookies or cakes for the others as gifts, and they tasted incredible.After some bargaining via comms, Stress finally agreed to help as long as they’d make one shed keep. She would be here in a few minutes, and they would bake the best pudding ever known to hermitcraft!———————————————After an hour filled with laughs, messes and a considerably larger amount of carefulness, two perfectly shaped and cooked puddings sat on front of the satisfied bakers.Stress offered him a piece of hers, which he took gratefully. He scooped up a small amount with his spoon, lifted it up to his mouth and-Oh.
Oh.
So that’s why people loved them so much.It crumbled beautifully in his mouth, releasing flavours of fruits, nuts and spices that all mixed together to create a flavour that couldn’t really be described as anything but ‘Christmas-y’.Taking another bite, and then another, he started to realise that one pudding wouldn’t be enough to feed a whole server, he’d probably need at least another 4 or 5…Well, he knew what he’d spend the rest of his day doing!",1

"The city above is beautiful; the shining jewel at the heart of fifteen thousand years of their people’s culture. A place so remarked upon for its beauty that at least one Asari guidebook describes it as ‘so beautiful one could hardly believe it is turian at all’. Typical attitude.If they knew what lay below the silver streets and towering, golden buildings, well, perhaps they would revise their opinions.But as far as anyone outside of the hierarchy knew, there was nothing below there.Saren knew better, primarily because he’d spent his own time down in this miserable place. Just shy of a year without seeing sun or sky, mired in grief so intense that he had rather got the impression that he’d buried himself in the rubble to the east of this non-existent place.It was easy to remember his pain now, the genuine questioning of whether he had already died without realising it and whether this was simply all that came next. The damp, earthy surroundings were fitting of a grave, even without the pervading scent of rot - one could easily allow themselves to believe they would stumble across their own corpse in a place like this.But this time, he knew that he would get to leave again.Whether the man - still and quiet as if he’d given up life already - would be afforded the same good fortune that he would remained to be seen.Realistically speaking, to even make it this far, Rix had already been unbelievably lucky.He’d read the official report - it’d flagged itself given the content it held - and then out of curiosity he’d read the file of the man it discussed. Lifer, single, no dependents, no registered next of kin. Last of his legion.And after this, not even a passing acquaintance who was willing to put name to knowing him.He’d had that much, at least. Dirus had been a family and they at least had not turned their backs on him, even after everything he had done. He knew that was the only reason he had been lucky enough to be offered a chance.“If you’re going to stare at me like a zoo animal, you could at least go do so via the cameras.”  He… hadn’t even realised that Rix was awake, or that he was in any way aware that he was being watched.“The cameras are offline.” This drew the first sign of life from him, one black eye cracking open. “They will remain that way for some time, I suspect. Perhaps we should use this time productively.”“To do what?” The eye slipped closed once more with an exasperated huff. “Considering I’m still breathing, you’re not here to kill me, are you?”Briefly, he entertained the thought. Get the answers he desired and then… put him out of his misery lest it be dragged out any further than was necessary. “I wish to question you about what happened down there.”“You’re a Spectre, Arterius, go read the report.” He rolled onto his side - turning his back to him. “It was written by people a lot fucking smarter than me. I’m just the animal that pushed a button.”Just the person who’d pushed the button. He’d said it about himself, once.“They were not on the ground, were they?” He straightened up, waited for this to draw a reaction and… when it didn’t, continued all the same. “It was hard to think down there, was it not? You described their behaviour as cult-like and… there was an object which they were worshipping, was there not? Something which was impossible to describe?”In an instant, Rix was on his feet, face pressed against the bars with a feral hiss. “How do you know that?”Because he’d seen it before, first hand. Had paid too great a price in discovering that there was only one solution to that situation. He didn’t need him to describe it, didn’t need any other questions answered. The terror and anger in his subvocals was all the proof he’d ever need to know that bombing Dregir had been the right thing to do, for all that Rix was torturing himself over it.Again, something that felt like kinship intermingling with pity bubbled up.Lifer, single, no dependents, no registered next of kin. Nobody to miss him when the hierarchy’s attempt to save face and neatly apportion blame in one fell swoop landed him in an unmarked grave.He’d been lucky.Maybe it was time to share some of that luck with another unwitting victim.Saren raised a hand - Rix backed off warily - and the door lock shorted out. ‘Come with me.”",1
"Chapter Text

“Your father wants you in his office, you should hurry!” 






“Am I acceptable like this, Nanny Madee?” Vegas asks. 






The woman eyes him over the rim of her glasses. 






“Hm. Put a satin shirt on. I’ve had a few cleaned and pressed for you, they are in your wardrobe.” 






“Thank you, Nanny.” 






“It’ll be fine, young master.”






Vegas nods. He knows his father, and he knows it won’t be fine. But his nanny, as much as his father yells at her and insults her, seems to have gained an unshakeable sympathy for Vegas, although he is bristly and cold. Not because he doesn’t like her (in fact, he does, and a lot at that), but because he knows one of these days his father will have her disappear without a trace and he won’t be given the luxury of mourning the loss. 






He changes his shirt and has one last critical look at himself in the full length mirror before heading to his father’s office. 






“How old are you now?” Gun asks, once Vegas is finished bowing before him. 






“Fifteen, Pa.” Vegas answers. Technically, he’s not fifteen yet, his birthday is in two weeks, but he’s entered the year in which he turns that age. 






His first thought at his father’s question is, why does it matter? Vegas soon realises that fifteen is the age of consent in his country, but that can’t be it. He’s pretty sure his father would kill him if he found out he had sex - luckily, the thought has not crossed Vegas’ mind, not even as a way of rebelling. He’s too busy to look at people that way.






“So you’re a fully grown man then.” Gun says, measuring his son up and down with a critical gaze. “Grown is overstating things, but anyway. Mr Liu Wei is someone I met at a casino during a Texas Hold’em tournament and he would like to do business with our family. I have somewhere I need to be so I’m sending you in my stead. I expect you to return with a sealed deal and also, you should gain the favour of Mr Liu Wei’s family so they will want to do business exclusively with us from now on.” 






“Understood, Pa.” 






“I want you to be pleasant and use your charm to get Mr Liu Wei to want to sign with our family. Wash yourself, do your hair, dress expensive, put on jewels. I need this deal.”






“Yes, Pa. I won’t let you down.” Vegas says, bowing again. 






“Oh, and Vegas? If you fail, don’t bother showing up back here.”













Vegas is driven by two of his father’s bodyguards to a private villa that is not on the navigation map. He gets dropped off at the gate and once he is allowed through it, the bodyguards drive off and he is left walking up a steep hill to get to the river rock alley leading to the villa itself. 






“Khun Vegas of the Theerapanyakul family. Welcome. Mr Liu Wei is expecting you.” One of the bodyguards greets Vegas and shows him inside, through a labyrinth of corridors, an elevator, two flights of stairs and countless turns. Eventually, the bodyguard opens a heavy door before Vegas and shows him inside. 






It’s a very imposing office, and a fat man in his fifties is sitting at the desk. 






“Ah. Vegas, right?” The man says, gesturing for Vegas to approach and have a seat on the opposite side of the heavy desk. 






Vegas can immediately tell this meeting is not set to go his way. He is a guest, feeling awkward, a stranger in this man’s home, and the one asking for something. 






Luckily, he came prepared. 






“I’ve heard a lot about you from your father, only good things of course. I believe we will do good business together, you and I.” 






“That is my hope as well, sir.”",1
"Fang dresses up in a pretty sundress that his big brother had bought for him because it's summer and he twirls around in it, the little skirt hiking up his thighs, feeling beautiful for the first time in a while, but Fang can't help but flush when he feels Kaizo looking at him so intensely, as if he might just eat him up.""Wow, Pang, you are really blossoming into the most beautiful flower there is,"" Kaizo says in awe, sounding breathless as he feels, as he pulls Fang on top of his lap, straddling his hips with one knee pressed to each side. He places a hand on Fang's thigh, letting his fingers slip inside of his sundress and creep up his plush flesh. ""I love watching you bloom so prettily.""Fang lets out a whimper when Kaizo's fingers press against the inside of his thighs, feeling for the damp spot growing at the front of his panties and pushing his slick folds wide apart. This isn't right, he thinks. This is so wrong for Kaizo to do as his big brother. But it feels so good, so good that he wants it to be right.",1

His coffee was on the far end of the kitchen island, steaming and black, just as he liked it. 
It was a familiar sight, one that once would have filled him with quiet, steady joy, but now it made his stomach twist sourly and a sigh rise in his throat. 
All the little signs of Charlie’s kindness that littered the house tended to do that. 
Not that he thought them insincere. 
Far from it. 
Charlie and kindness were practically synonyms, at least in his mind. 
But this went so far beyond the man’s usual good grace. 
After Mick had come clean with him about the entirety of what had happened during his cancer treatments, Charlie had changed. 
Their unspoken agreement not to tell him had arisen not so much out of any amorphous desire to hide the truth from him, as to prevent him from instantly assigning blame for the entire incident, and especially Keith’s rapid downwards spiral, to himself. 
Any hope they’d had of mitigating Charlie’s guilt had died within the first handful of days. 
He steadfastly refused to bring the topic up, but Keith had caught the former artist studying him in an unguarded moment, and the self-loathing and fear which lit his eyes hurt even to look at. 
Initially, and quite naively, they’d thought it was best to just let him get it out of his system, to play along for a bit and wait until he’d assuaged his conscience enough to go back to normal. 
Waking up without him in the bed the next morning, and having every meal and snack made for them, when they normally shared that duty, should have been the first indication that it was an asinine plan. 
It had only been when Mick mentioned that they slept easier with him between them that he’d stopped sleeping in the draftiest, barely furnished guest bedroom in the place. 
They rarely saw him if he wasn’t, though he very frequently was, doing something for them. 
Whether it be fetching a blanket, giving a shoulder rub, making tea, or countless other favors, small and large. 
It was as though he melted into the walls, waiting for their beck and call and making himself scarce in the meantime, like his servitude was all they’d still want of him. 
Anything they asked for was theirs.
He no longer initiated hugs and kisses, and, while he accepted them when they were given, he was quick to give all the pleasure he could and then redirect Mick and Keith towards each other, seemingly blind to (or uncaring of) getting anything for himself. 
Two nights before, when they’d gotten distracted from preparing for bed, he’d pressed a line of kisses from the nape of Keith’s neck down his spine to the lowest part of his back, just the way he knew drove the guitarist the craziest. 
When Keith attempted to return the favor and began running his fingers teasingly over the sides of the his abdominals, Charlie had, ever so gently, pushed his hands away and placed them into Mick’s hair, murmuring in his ear about how much the vocalist loved it when he played with his hair. 
Mick had met the same response when he attempted to rub Charlie’s shoulders. 
After a month and a half of living this perpetual, slow motion nightmare, Keith was beginning to think it would never end. 
 
◑  ◐
 
They’d awoken one night, only a week or so previous, to find Charlie curled up on the floor at the foot of the bed, like he was their dog rather than their partner. 
He’d told him, perhaps too harshly, that he’d better never catch him doing it again. 
It wasn’t just his inherent disgust at the image it evoked, or the painful lack of Charlie in his arms, which provoked the response. 
With the man out of their reach for so much of every day, the time they had together at night, especially when his two other partners were asleep, was often his only opportunity to check up on him. 
Having appointed himself the duty of preparing each meal, and rising excruciatingly early to have breakfast on the table and himself out of the kitchen by the time they came down to eat, breakfast was almost always the sole meal they all shared. 
If the increasing prominence of Charlie’s ribs, and the gradual deflation of his stomach from flat to concave, was anything to go by, it was also the sole meal that the drummer was allowing himself every day. 
Without keeping an eye on him, Keith’s mind supplied, their partner would rapidly, happily waste away to nothing. 
Even with both of their eyes on him, they didn’t appear to be doing much but hastening his fate.",1

"“Don't say a word, I know what you're about to say. Don't,” he said, looking at her. She didn't care anymore, she was done hiding how she felt, done trying to be strong.“I love you,” she whispered, her eyes filling with tears. “Don't do it, please, Harry, don't do what I know you think you have to do. You and I both know you might not come back,” she begged, knowing he wouldn't listen, knowing her words were useless. He had to do this, or at least he thought he had to do this. She knew he was probably right, he had to end this, only he could.“I can't, I have to. We both  know it.”
She nodded, taking his hand in hers, squeezing it before releasing it, knowing she might never see him alive again. Their fingertips lingered together, before he finally pulled away, looking at the ground, not wanting to meet her eyes, to see the pain he knew was there.“I'll come back to you, I promise,” he whispered, kissing her forehead. She shook her head, kissing his lips, knowing this might be the only time she could.“Don't, don't make a promise we both know you can't possibly keep. I love you, Harry,” she repeated, looking at the man who had once been her best friend. She wondered when it had changed, when her feelings had changed. It didn't matter now. All that mattered was she'd done it, she'd told him, knowing it wouldn't change anything.“I love you too,” he said softly, reaching out and stroking her cheek one last time before darting off to meet the mad man who had destroyed his life, the evil he knew he needed to destroy, that only he could destroy,  if he ever wanted a chance at happiness, a chance to live his life.",1
"“Hey, you,” said Raffi as she stepped off the transporter pad towards Seven.Seven and Raffi’s eyes had been locked in on each other’s since she beamed in. Both of them were completely oblivious to the reunion of Worf with Jean-Luc, Beverly, and Will happening around them.Seven suddenly felt a wave of emotion pass through her that she wasn’t quite expecting. It had been months since she had seen Raffi, and this was definitely an overwhelming surprise.“Raff-,” she began, as she reached for Raffi’s arms.“Come here.”She smiled and motioned Raffi into a warm hug. A hug that, for Raffi, seemed to heal everything for a moment. The haunting memories from her mission vanished. All that mattered was that she was home - Seven was her home.As Seven released the hug, she softly placed her forehead against Raffi’s. They were simply taking in the moment. She looked down and noticed her Fenris Ranger belt around Raffi’s waist.“Nice belt,” she said as she ran her thumb over the logoed belt buckle.“You know, maybe if you’re good, I’ll let you take it off me later,” whispered Raffi in Seven’s ear.Seven smirked and began going in for a kiss when she suddenly was halted by a stern, “ahem,” from Jean-Luc.Seven and Raffi looked up to find the rest of the reunion crew looking at them with raised eyebrows and open mouths.Seven suddenly took on a formal tone. “Ah, yes… Follow me, Commander, to the briefing room. We have much to discuss,” she said as she straightened her posture and placed her hands behind her back.“Yes, Commander! We do indeed. Show the way,” Raffi responded using her formal tone as well.Seven and Raffi exited the room, leaving behind a still in shock crew.“Ignore them. They’re a mess,” said Jean-Luc, shaking his head.",1

"It hadn't always been like this.

Once, upon a time, before he had learned of his powers, Eric had been able to live a completely normal life. He went to school, his parents dragged him to soccer practice every Tuesday, he had friends and family who loved him.

But then his mom got sick.

It had been devastating when she passed. Eric had sworn he would never allow anyone to go through the torment his mother went through ever again. He knew it was childish, but he decided that if anyone was to figure out how to cure all illness in the world, he was determined it would be him.

And, though he didn't know exactly how, his determination seemed to manifest into a reality.

When his friend got sick, just a common cold, Eric could feel it. He felt the illness festering inside his friend, and when he tried to grab onto it in his mind, he was miraculously able to pull the sickness out of his friend's body.

His friend hadn't noticed a thing, until he realised with a start that the symptoms he had been feeling a moment earlier had suddenly, inexplicably, let up. Eric never mentioned his actions, knowing his friend would just call him crazy or think he was making it up. Even Eric himself thought he must have been making it up. There’s no way he could have cured someone of their cold just by willing it to go away.

But then it happened again. 

His aunt got pneumonia. When he and his father visited her in the hospital, he grabbed onto that same feeling when it presented itself, and pulled it from her. She made a full recovery in seconds, proclaiming it to be a miracle sent from God.

This time was a little different though. He knows now that it’s because pneumonia is much harsher than a common cold, but at the time it had been confusing when he had started to feel the same symptoms she had been feeling. It was to a much lesser extent, only noticeable when he was thinking about it, but still there nonetheless.

He started trying to use this power more often. It seemed to work on just about anything. A friend had a scrape on their leg. It vanished and a barely noticeable nick appeared in the same spot on his own body. A family member had an asthma attack and didn’t have their puffer. He could feel his throat tighten up a little, but it was much more manageable than the real thing.

Eric eventually confided in his dad what was going on. He had been shocked, especially when he realised it must be true, but he accepted it. 

And then other people started finding out.

People he had never met before started asking him to cure them when he passed them on the street. Hospitals started asking if he could come in to cure a terminal case they had. He started being flown out to other countries to cure important leaders.

At first, he was happy to do it. He could finally help people! He could help prevent the suffering he had seen his mother go through all those years ago.

But it started to take its toll on him. For every ailment he cured, he incurred some of the pain. A few years down the line, he was taking prescription painkillers constantly, and it still wasn’t enough. Taking on all the world’s suffering was his ideal, but it still meant he had to suffer an enormous amount. 

He kept doing it though. 

He kept doing it, even though it hurt just to wake up, even though trying to slog through daily life was torment, even though he became a shadow of his former self as the pain overtook him.

It’s what the world needed.

He could be a hero for the world if all he had to sacrifice was himself.",1
"Chapter Text

Chapter one:

Thanks for the free kiss.

Branzy was a fairly young man, who was trying to get by with a few odd Jobs. He loved his city, and would never move, despite the high crime rates. The most famous criminal of them all was known as ClownPierce. Clown was a killer and a thief. Branzy was walking back to his small apartment through an alleyway. The sun had already set, and Branzy had a weird feeling about that night. Every inch of his body was yelling at him to run for his own safety. Branzy ignored his instincts and kept moving. That was until he heard talking from a building. The purple eyed man peeked his head around a corner and fear clouded his eyes. He saw a man with a clown mask talking to another man with a demon mask. Leaning against a wall nearby was a girl dressed in purple and another girl wearing a pink face mask and a darker pink outfit. He thought he recognized the pink girl but he was torn from his thoughts when he heard sirens. 

“Damn it.” Spoke the devil masked man.

“It’s fine, they haven't caught us before.” The clown masked man responded. This sentence made Branzy’s blood run cold. It confirmed his worries. This was a part of Clownpierce’s gang. That meant that the clown masked man was Clown himself and the devil masked guy was Rasplin. This meant the purple girl was Mid and the pink haired girl was the girl known as the Cello assassin. Branzy began to walk away backwards, terrified for his life. The sirens came closer and Clown laughed. He began to walk in Branzy’s direction.

“Come on guys, we’ve gotta get out of here.” Branzy panicked and took off running. He didn't care that it was likely the clown had heard him. He just heard the sirens and fear took over. He kept on running and running until he was out in the open again. Branzy felt someone begin to catch up with him and he lunged for a trash bin, hiding behind it. He heard footsteps and heard Clown chuckle to himself. 

“I love a good chase.” With that the man kept walking. Branzy rested his head against the wall and breathed a sigh of relief. He was safe. For now. Eventually he got back up and walked away. 
 
ClownPierce POV

Clownpierce was talking with his team about his newest heist plan. He heard someone walk over to them, and his eyes glanced to the side, seeing a cute white haired and purple eyed boy. Clowns head didn’t move so the boy didn't know he had seen him. He didn't seem to be a threat and so Clown just let him be. Eventually he heard the sirens and the team broke apart. Clown heard the boy run away and Clown chose to move in that direction as well. He saw the boy lunge behind a bin and try to hide. Clown chuckled.

“I love a good chase.” He continued walking away. He looped back and followed the boy as he headed back to where Clown assumed his house was. 




  Branzy POV

Branzy kept walking. He felt like someone was following him but he never saw anyone, so he just chalked it up to paranoia. Eventually Branzy began to feel this feeling every night when he went home. One day the purple eyed man had dealt with multiple Karen’s at his fast food job, and just wanted to go home and sleep. He went with the fastest, yet the most dangerous way home. As he went he heard an Alarm. A few minutes later he saw a figure run towards him. Branzy panicked and tried to back away. It turned out to be Clownpierce. The man grabbed Branzy and pinned him to the wall. He pulled off his mask and quickly clasped a hoodie around himself, tugging the hood somewhat down. Clown was easily the most attractive person Branzy had ever seen. Clowns brown/black hair fluttered behind him and his dark brown eyes stared into Branzy’s purple ones. Clown brushed some of Branzy’s white hair out of his face. They were pulled out of their trance when the police came running. Clown leaned forwards.

“Sorry about this beautiful.” Before Branzy could react, Clown kissed him. The police came running, and just saw a couple kissing. Once the police were far away they broke apart and stared into each other's eyes.

“Sorry again Mi Amor. But thanks for the free kiss.” Clown slipped his mask back on and winked before walking away. Branzy stood in the alley blushing hard. He eventually walked back to his home and Ivory, his roommate hugged Branzy tight.

“Oh branzy, i was so worried!” Ivory noticed the far away look  in his eyes.

“Are you alright?”

“Hm? Oh yeah i'm fine…” branzy walked to his room and collapsed onto his bed. 

“Mi Amor…. Thanks for the kiss…. Did the gods send me a demon?” Ivory listened from behind the door and sighed, phoning Clown.

“Clown! I told you not to flirt with my best friend!” She hissed.

“I cant help it! He’s so cute!”

“Yeah well now hes staring at the roof!”

“Tell him i already miss him.”

“No!” Ivory hung up. 

“Oh Branzy… this isn't safe for you…”",1
"Miu and Edward silently lounged on the older man's bed, one that the girl had grown accustomed to with the amount of times she had sneaked over his place for late night fun.The one that used to be painstakingly bare with only a white sheet and a pair of pillows, only used as its designed by, to sleep—but not to rest in comfortably after long shifts. It used to feel like a trivial thing for Edward as he had no attachment to it, not able to link it with anything but just a piece of object to push him forward to another day.It was now filled with accents of colors from the girls tendency to leave things in his room, From her beloved plushies to her loeapard print blanket, her makeup, just every knickknacks she can bring in to his life. It also was a prospect to how the younger woman had brought life and sparks of color within his dull, and washed black and white vision.Now he wouldn't be able to walk inside his room without a random stuff of her laying around, It felt oddly wrong to not see an indicator of her presence. Edward has grown accustomed to how her whole night skincare routine was scattered on his bedside table, fighting for space alongside the towers of papers from his research on the mayor and how far the rabbit hole of corruption really goes under Gotham. It felt off not to see golden strands or hair stuck on his comb, that he barely even used before, or,  the way his room smelled of strawberries from her soft perfume. Miu ran her manicured fingers to his messy mop of brown hair, his chest slowly leveling down wuth every stroke of her hands, lulling him further to the sweet embrace of sleep.Edward could put aside his world view for a moment, all the chaos and booming voices within his head dying down at her presence. She was his home, his rest. And for a moment, he let everything wash away, the orphange, Gothams rotten core, its nasty rats, and rested against her lap, melting away from her sheer warmth.The lovers locked eyes before Miu ushered him to sleep, kissing his eyelids as a bind to cast whatever spell she casted on Edward for him to feel as smitten as he was. With that, the man finally let himself be carried to dreamland, the muffled screams within his walls casting a sweet melody to his ears, dreaming nothing of her and his plans to deface the lowly rat in his basement.",1

"Misa Amane felt her heart pounding in her chest as she stood before L Lawliet, the enigmatic detective who had managed to capture her and Light Yagami. She knew that they were both guilty of terrible crimes, but she also knew that she had something that L wanted desperately.""Misa, what do you have to offer me?"" L asked, his voice cool and collected. ""You and Light are both facing serious charges. It would take quite a bribe to make me overlook them.""Misa took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she was about to do. She knew that L was a man who liked to be in control, but she was determined to take the reins.""I can offer you something that you've been wanting for a long time,"" Misa said, her voice low and sultry. ""Something that you've been denying yourself because you're too afraid to admit what you really want.""L raised an eyebrow, intrigued in spite of himself. ""And what would that be?""Misa stepped closer to L, running her hands up his chest and over his shoulders. ""Me, riding you until we both can't take it anymore,"" she whispered in his ear.L's eyes widened in surprise, but he didn't pull away. Misa could feel his body responding to her touch, and she knew that she had him right where she wanted him.""Fine,"" L said, his voice husky with desire. ""But if I do this, you and Light both walk free. And if you ever try to cross me again, I won't hesitate to put you both back behind bars.""Misa nodded eagerly, not caring about the consequences as long as she got what she wanted. She pushed L down onto the bed, straddling him and running her hands over his toned body. He was already hard, and Misa could feel herself growing wet with anticipation.She leaned down and kissed him deeply, her tongue exploring every inch of his mouth. L moaned into her mouth, his hands gripping her hips tightly as she rocked against him.Their clothes fell to the floor, no foreplay needed, as Misa was already drenched with the thought of being let free. It was a mix.. that of being free, and she also wanting to get it over with. She can admit, she had a crush on L before, so her past self was squealing… but Light is dear to her heart.Misa began to ride him slowly at first, savoring the feeling of him inside her. But soon her movements grew faster and more urgent, her body writhing with pleasure as she neared orgasm. L was panting beneath her, his hands gripping her hips tightly as he thrust up to meet her.Finally, Misa couldn't hold back any longer. She cried out in ecstasy as she came, her body convulsing around L's as he followed her over the edge. They collapsed onto the bed in a heap, both of them panting and sweating.For a moment, neither of them spoke. But then L sat up, a smirk on his face.""Consider your debt paid,"" he said, getting up from the bed and straightening his clothes. ""But don't think that this changes anything between us. You and Light are still under my watchful eye.""Misa nodded, knowing that she had gotten what she wanted. But as she got dressed and left the room, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She knew that L was a dangerous man, and that he would always be watching her.But for now, she was free. And that was all that mattered.As she walked down the hall, she couldn't help but think about what had just happened. She was both exhilarated and terrified at the same time. She had never felt such a powerful connection with anyone before, but she also knew that she had just given herself over to a man who was notorious for his lack of emotion.Misa couldn't ignore the nagging feeling in the back of her mind that this was just the beginning of a dangerous game. She knew that L would never truly trust her, and that he would always be looking for a way to use her to his advantage.But for now, she would enjoy her freedom.",1

"Dr. Jason ""Jay"" Xavier, level three researcher and a man who has a promising journey as an employee in the facility situated somewhere in the middle of the underground.So, he's called to the director's office from the testing chambers with a friend and another anomaly, Spoke with nothing but a pen and his cup of coffee that has long since cooled down from him just standing there and just looking at what exactly Spoke can do.""Hello?"" Parrot calls out the site director's office.There's another guy there- well, two. He knows both of them. One more over the other. So there's the site's best psychiatrist, Dr. Marriot or rather just Rekrap and then there's another researcher, Dr. Greyson which is Jaron who is also known for surviving multiple breaches in containment with sheer luck.""Oh, wow, you finally came."" Jaron jokes to him.""Look, running with a cup of coffee in a hallway of slippery floors is not easy."" Parrot tells him. ""So, please, shut up, okay?""""Alright, enough."" Branzy, the site director and the man assigned to this entire facility, stands up to grab a folder from a drawer in the office.The director places the folder on the desk and the three look at eachother on who's going to open it first like some gift under the christmas three. Parrot's in the middle so he grabs it for himself and opens the file.Number #: SCP-7888, Object Class: Safe It reads out, but the code name isn't present on the file for some reason.""So, uh- Jaron, Parrot, both of you were chosen to take hold of this anomaly until further notice. Rek is here to do a psychological evaluation on the anomaly."" Branzy explains.
Description: SCP-7888 is composed of two parts. SCP-7888-A is a phone with a navy blue case and SCP-7888-B is a nineteen(19) year-old named 'Vortex' from Beacon, New York. SCP-7888-B lives in a parallel reality where all living beings do not exist with exception of him. Time seems to also be frozen in this version of reality.
""So...."" Jaron clicks his tongue. ""it's a kid's phone?""""Well, yeah, it's safe obviously."" Branzy replies. ""I don't think it's gonna explode in your face or something like that. The only reason it's in our posession is 'cause this guy is attached to this phone which is the only bridge between our reality and his. Even without the- the no people thing, it's still anomalous because we somehow have a phone of a person that does not exist in our world.""""I think years of isolation and not having a single ounce of social stuff going on is probably enough to warrant a visit to a psychologist."" Parrot remarks.The other three look at him, staring.Just staring.The watch around Branzy's wrist ticks and the director clicks his tongue.""Yeah- well, yeah, that's kind of the entire point why Rekrap is here in the first place. It's not like he can successfully study an anomaly without dying or getting injured in a way."" Branzy says.""The last time I was invited to research an anomaly, I almost died."" Rekrap adds on.""And that's why we don't put site psychiatrists in danger anymore.""Parrot's holding the file and the three are walking to the containment area for this little phone guy. Branzy gave them some stuff to remember, like, they don't need a charger for this phone and they can communicate to the anomaly(a nineteen year old that doesn't know what's happening) through his phone's notes app.There's a few things Parrot has subconsciously learned against his own will, like this Vortex guy sometimes bullying researchers if they don't play in with stuff like jokes; that his birthday is somewhere in March; and that he probably has an addiction to red bull but hey, Parrot doesn't like seeing himself commenting on other people's business.The three all get to the containment area with a plaque above the metal letting them know of it. Most euclid and safe anomalies in site-15 are contained here. From objects to a dimension-hopper who's screams are keter-class despite being classified as safe in his file.The room for this anomaly isn't all that fancy. Just a boring white room with the traditional containment locker for the object anomalies and a metal table with two chairs parallel to eachother.Parrot sets down the file onto the table before he opens up the locker to the phone. Rek takes the time to read through the catalogues of people who made it through actually speaking to this 'Vortex' person.""Alright, here's the phone."" Parrot announces to the two others in the room with him.He can't really say that he'd like this phone but it looks okay enough. It has a navy blue, plastic casing with a golden coloured border on the sides.""Does it have a password?"" Jaron asks.""Uh, yeah."" Parrot answers.""Try zero-three, twenty-four."" Rekrap says as he looks up fron the file.Surprisingly, it works. What comes next is showing the wallpaper with a bunch of other apps organized into small groups.The wallpaper is of the owner with a gecko- a lizard, some kind of reptile, Parrot is not an expert. The owner, Vortex, is holding this reptile up in the shade in a car and the first thing Parrot can point out is probably the guy's silver eyes and the slight bruise on his lips.""So, uh, where do we start then?""Just as when Parrot asks, the screen starts to move by itself. Swiping through apps, clicking, before getting to the notes application.The keyboard props up and Parrot and Jaron are really confused.'Who are you?' The writer on the other end asks them.",1
"As Light Yagami kissed Misa Amane's inner thighs, he could feel her shiver with anticipation. He moved his hands up her body, kissing every inch of skin he could reach. As he reached her hips, he looked up into her eyes, and she gave him a coy smile.""Please,"" she whispered, ""I want to feel your tongue on me.""Without hesitation, Light began to kiss his way up towards Misa's clit, taking his time to savor every inch of her skin. He could feel the heat emanating from her core, and the sweet scent of her arousal filled his nostrils. When he finally reached his destination, he took her clit gently between his lips, flicking his tongue back and forth across it.Misa moaned softly, her hands running through Light's hair as he continued to pleasure her. He could tell that she was close, so he increased the pressure of his lips and tongue, moving faster and faster until she came with a shuddering cry.But Light wasn't done yet. As Misa lay there, panting and sated, he continued to explore her body with his lips and tongue. He kissed his way down her inner thighs, leaving a trail of wet kisses in his wake. When he reached her feet, he took her toes into his mouth, sucking on them gently while he stroked her calves with his hands.Misa moaned again, her body responding to every touch. She was putty in his hands, and he reveled in the power he had over her. He knew that he could make her come again if he wanted to, but he decided to take his time and explore every inch of her body.He kissed his way back up her legs, kissing the soft flesh behind her knees and the sensitive skin on the inside of her thighs. When he reached her pussy again, he took his time, exploring every fold and crevice with his tongue. He could feel Misa's body responding to his touch, and he knew that she was close again.This time, he didn't hold back. He increased the pressure of his tongue and lips, moving faster and faster until Misa came again with a cry that echoed off the walls. She was shaking with pleasure, her body writhing beneath him.As Misa lay there, spent and sated, Light kissed his way back up her body until he reached her lips. They kissed deeply, both of them still feeling the intensity of their shared pleasure.It was a moment that neither of them would forget anytime soon. Light had never felt so powerful, so in control. And Misa had never felt so loved, so cherished.",1
"Life was good. The duck’s family was settling slowly but surely into the new dynamics provided by the two avians. 
 
The three Caballeros were closer than ever. After helping Donald to bed that one time to alleviate the burden it became clear to all three that it was in no means a temporary arrangement. 
 
Firstly because everything became easier for him, Panchito and José taking turns with him getting up when the ducklings started crying and also because the added weight and warmth of the two eased something in him, something left gaping with grief and anger toward his sister, toward his family. 
 
Secondly because he soon learned that the other two had agreed to leave him what is now his room and they shared the cramped little office and more often than not, had to sleep on the couch. They agreed that sharing one bed was better anyway, more comfortable, saved on the heating bill… they found plenty of reasons to not stop. They would need a bigger bed at some point though. 
 
Life was good. 
 
Tonight it was Donald's turn to make dinner. Donald was quite good in the kitchen, even though his malchance acted up anytime. Louie strapped to his chest, the duck flipped pancakes over. Breakfast Dinner, boom. Perfect for stormy nights. 
 
While Huey and Dewey were fine being held or distracted by the other two Louie ,ever the fuzzy one, refused to be held by anyone other than him and so here he was, strapped to his chest in a baby sling while Huwey was making a mess of his highchair and Panchito’s t shirt, José snickering behind him Dewey sleeping on his shoulder. 
 
“Almost done, guys.” he said without turning toward the other two. 
 
José hummed positively, Panchito too busy cooing to Huey. Huey was really a difficult one when it comes to putting him to sleep or feeding him,he’s quite picky when it’s not a bottle.
 
The storm outside was getting stronger, a flash of light coming through the curtains. Unbothered, he flipped the last pancake out of the pan reaching to turn off the stove but the moment he did, the light went out. 
 
“Quê!” “ Did you turn off the light ?” came the surprised voices of the other avians. 
 
“ Sorry, guys. I think the fuse was blown out when I turned it off, it must be a short circuit.” He muttered, blindly rummaging in different drawers to look for a flashlight or even a candle. Ari had a night off, courtesy of the girls, so he had no idea where he would put it.
 
“ I don’t think it was you, pantiho.” said José from the windows, the curtains drawn back showing nothing but darkness. “ It’s the same for the whole street, probably for the whole town too.” he concluded before closing the curtain. 
 
He finally found what he thinks is a couple of glow sticks, hard to tell when it was pitch black. Tentatively bending one he waited until he heard a faint crack, followed by a green light, to pass the other sticks around. 
 
“ Would not be the first time a whole town blacked out because of me.” he snickered, handing his glow stick to José. He went back and took the plate of pancake he had left on the counter grabbing other things like syrup, butter and fruit. He came back arms full to push furniture, throwing out cushions on the ground with various buddled blanket. 
 
“What are you doing ?” he asked.
 
“Donal’ ,come sit down with us !” excitedly said the rooster, Huey in his lap. José had put down Dewey who was still sleeping soundly on a buddled blanket before Panchito put Huey down with him, both yellow ducklings turning to huddle into each other. Unstripping the baby sling, he gently set Louie down too and like his brother, turned to huddle into the other. 
 
“Lindos Patitos.” said the red rooster with a smile. 

“Eat your pancakes, Panchito.”  
 
“ I found candles and a game of cards.” 
 
- - - - - - - - - -
 
“You’re cheating !
 
“ No I’m not !
 
“ Shhh don’t wake them up “
 
“I don’t know how but you’re cheating Patito.” 
 
With a smirk the duck answered “ You can’t prove anything.” 
 
- - - - - - - - - -
 
The light was not back yet but it didn’t bother them that much. Since it was getting late, Donald took the boys back to their bed, leaving the other two to gather the cushion and comforter Panchito had gathered. When getting ready for bed a thought pops into his mind.He was still thinking about it after the other two joined him in bed.  
 
“Is it weird?”
 
“Is what weird, amigo?” whispered José half asleep.
 
“What were we doing? Sleeping in the same bed and all.”
 
“And all? You mean the cuddling or the pet names or the signs of affection?.”
 
“Hmm.” 
 
“Well. I don’t think it’s weird … Whatever it is, as long as it makes all of us happy, I don’t see why it would be weird. Maybe people outside of it would but they don’t matter. What matters to me is you two.” said Panchito.
 
Donald and José exchanged a look trying to stifle their laughter. 
 
Life was good to him.",1
"It comes down to Sakura and Naruto and that really isn’t a choice at all. Naruto is in the village only half the time, running errands, running missions for Kakashi. The war was less than a decade ago, but besides their ever-steady alliance with Sunagakure, things are already looking worse. Konoha has the benefit of having the strongest Jinchuuriki, but Konoha has to shoulder the loss of being the cause of so much hurt. They all know it and Kakashi knows it too. When she was younger, Sakura hadn’t understood, but now, so much bloodshed later, she thinks of herself at six, thinks of her teacher, and wonders if Kakashi would have ever been given a genin team if not for the Kyuubi and the Sharingan.He’s prepping them for the worst again. Naruto isn’t anywhere near ready to become Hokage and Sakura is uncertain Kakashi isn’t willing to abolish the system altogether. Naruto is their strongest fighter and while they love him, there’s no guarantee whoever is in charge next will always love their greatest weapon.So Naruto is learning administration and all the grueling work of the anbu he should’ve been too kind for. He’s meaner nowadays, less hesitant to take a life as if he hadn’t killed at age twelve first and only kept going since.But that’s what the thought returns to: herself and Naruto. Naruto is out of the village or he’s up until 2 a.m. learning what they need to survive the next war.Sakura is doing the same, but for her, it’s taking over the hospital and the dozens of boxes full of Orochimaru’s research. She’s busy too, but she’s in the village, and Kakashi is keeping her here for a reason she can’t decipher yet. She wonders, sometimes, what her role was supposed to be, squished between Naruto and Sasuke. If they expected her to die and utilize whatever brutality inflicted on her would make greater use of her teammates.She returns to the present, to her messy apartment that is Naruto’s because he’s gone so often that keeping his own is a hassle. They can also afford a much nicer place together. Sakura hates how messy he is and how he disrupts her schedule, but she hates the loneliness more and is settled when he’s within reach. It’s only temporary for now, they both know it, but it works.And it leaves them in their predicament.Naruto doesn’t talk about his missions. In part because he’s not allowed to, in part because they’ve been taught to leave their missions at Konoha’s gate. But this mission, its result at least, returned home with him.Uchiha Sarada is preciously small and quiet in a way babies usually aren’t. Sakura doesn’t quite believe Naruto when he says that Sasuke just gave her to him, but she’s never understood what was up with them, with Sasuke and his ever-changing view of his own clan. She used to blame herself, but it’s not her failure, it never was.“I could take fewer missions,” says Naruto, says the orphan, who doesn’t know what the bare minimum is because he received so much less.“Don’t be stupid,” Sakura replies. “Even if you’re not on a mission, you’re busy and only end up knocked out on the sofa.”He has a bed but doesn’t make it there most nights.“She can’t go into the orphanage or foster care,” Naruto points out like Sakura doesn’t know that. Leaving the last Uchiha heir without adequate protection is insane. Konoha wouldn’t go to war over a single stolen infant rejected even by her parents. They know it, the other villages know it too, and after the war, everyone wants an Uchiha of their own. She wonders what that says about the Third Hokage leaving Sasuke on his own.“I can take her,” Sakura decides. She’s strong enough, she’s in the village, and she has the time for it.Naruto looks like she’s grown a second head, like he wasn’t suggesting raising Sarada himself a minute ago.“I didn’t know you ever wanted kids.”“It’s not about wanting.” It really isn’t, especially for shinobi, and Sakura has rarely gotten what she wanted.Sarada is small, however, and Sakura thinks she’ll learn to love her for it.",1
"It’s not often Vil wakes up in the middle of the night. He’s quite happy with his ability to get good undisturbed sleep, most of which has its sweet spot between seven and a half to eight hours for optimal rest.However, even Vil is not immune to needing a trip to the bathroom, or a temperature change making him stir in his sleep. Or in the current case: a visitor. Something which is becoming increasingly less rare as the days go on. There's no creak of the door, nor the window leading to his balcony creeping open. Just a sudden  presence  where there was none before.  As undetected as said presence is trying to be, Vil still starts to sluggishly rouse from his sleep. The dim glow of something breaches through his still-closed eyelids. The sight of a rather familiar small, soft greenish light on the tip of his nose is enough to make Vil sigh, close his eyes fully again and pull his blanket over the bottom of his face. There’s a low chuckle, followed by the first rustle of someone stepping on the carpet. “Did I wake you?” The bed shifts when Vil’s nighttime intruder starts to crawl into it, shuffling closer as they worm their way under the blanket, which Vil is seemingly not content to share at the moment. “Could have done without the glowing…” Vil yawns, feeling Malleus get close enough to press his body against theirs, wrapping an arm around their waist to tug them just a little closer until Malleus’ chest meets Vil’s back.A ghost of a kiss is placed on the back of his neck as an apology, before their forehead leans into the back of his own head. “Apologies,” Malleus starts, then interrupts himself with a chuckle before he can continue, recalling an almost fond memory. “But the previous time I entered without ensuring you knew it was me, I took a blast of magic to the abdomen.” “A well-deserved one, might I add.” Vil states, his voice drowsy and slow, slightly annoyed, perhaps. “A well-deserved one.” Malleus parrots with a smile, agreeing with the statement. If anything, it’s comforting that Vil doesn’t hesitate to ensure his own safety when in a state of vulnerability such as barely waking from sleep.It’s a quality they should be proud of, thus Malleus will proudly take that spell to the gut. “Cold again?” Malleus hums a nod in response to their question. As the days grow colder, and Diasomnia itself has always been quite chilly, it’s more common for Malleus to seek out warmth for a more comfortable night. The cons of being a cold-blooded fae.Often, this was solved with a simple spell or two, something that came as easily as breathing, as Malleus loves to compare his usage of magic. But, a coincidental movie night with Vil which ended in Malleus sleeping in the Pomefiore House warden’s dorm room made him remember something very... quaint. Humans are warm creatures.  And leeching warmth from one is certainly much more fun than a plain heating spell. Once Malleus had figured that out, he hadn’t been sleeping in his own room much the past week. He isn’t sure if it’s a tad cruel that he never directly disclosed to Vil that he  could  use magic to keep himself warm instead of needing Vil for it. On the other hand, it’s been more than two years for both of them at Night Raven College, and Vil is too observant not to realize this “cold problem” couldn’t be a sudden new one and they must’ve had a way to stave it off the previous years. Malleus thinks Vil is actively acting oblivious to the situation. And isn’t that an adorable thought? “Next time, come a bit earlier… It isn’t nice to disturb me at two in the morning, I have to get up in five hours.” Vil shuffles around to get comfortable, releasing a tired sigh to rid himself of any possible tension. “It’s two-thirty, love.” “That is not helping your case.”Malleus hums a laugh and nuzzles his face into the crook of Vil’s neck to settle down, which the other makes an appreciative sound at, nudging his head against theirs momentarily before laying it back down on his pillow. A sign of affection —and something that lets Malleus know that, luckily, they don’t seem too mad or annoyed— before they return to proper sleep. ""Sleep, rosebud."" Malleus speaks in a hushed tone, placing one last kiss to the side of their neck. ""I'll make it up to you tomorrow, promise."" “Sweet dreams, schatz.”  “Sweet dreams.”",1
"When the clock strike twelve the dancefloor was filled with drunks people who are grinding and feeling eachother bodies. While I’m at the bar counter enjoying myself with a glass of cosmopolitan and overhearing some guy lame pick-up lines to lure someone to their bed.And someone stumbles beside me, drawing my attention away from my cosmopolitan.“Sorry.”“It’s okay.” I smiled as I returned ng attention to my drink. When someone at the dark corner of the bar caught your attention. He raised his glass in my direction, acknowledging my presence. I smiled back and did the same thing.“Someone caught you attention, Jeonghan?” Joshua asked one of his close friends who are working at the club as a bartender.“Maybe.” I said with devil grin.“Someone is getting laid tonight.” Joshua said as he walked away from him to fill up drinks of some bar’s patron.I took one last sip of my drink as I made my way to the dance floor. The low basa and melodic tune were luring. I closed my eyes as my body moves to the thumping beat.When I opened my eyes the man who caught my attention earlier was staring at me like he is undressing me with his eyes. While he playes the brim of his glass between his lips. I wink at him and continue dancing with our gaze locked together. As the music changes to seductive sounds. The stranger made his way towards me.And now, our bodies move to the rhythm of the music. While our hands were exploring each other bodies.“What’s your name?” I asked him while his lips were giving me feathery kissess in my jawline and his hand was slowly creeping inside my pants going to my clothed member.“Jeonghan.” I replies as I pulled him closer and gave him an open-mouth kissed. As I felt his thumb rubs a circular motion at the tip of my length againgt the fabric of my boxer.“Seungcheol.” He said and his lips moves further down to my expose collarbones. And my hand was inside of his pants, stroking him.“Come on, I’m going to take you for a ride.” I whispered and pulled him our from the bar.xxxAs Seungcheol drags us towards his ride he grips my hand tightly, his grip is firm but his skin is soft and radiant heat that makes me crave for him more. He harshly pushed me at the passenger seat door. As he pulled up my shirt and roughly licks and bites my erected nubs.I slid my hand inside his back pocket to looks for his keys. And immediately found them. I slightly pushed him to stop. “Let’s go somewhere, shall we?”Seungcheol nodded and I opened the car door for him and pushed him inside at the passenger seat. As I get inside to the driver’seat and drove us back to my place.“Shit” I breathe out when I felt his hand squeezing my inner thighs and his fingers playing with the zipper of my pants.“Eyes on the road, Jeonghan.” Seungcheol said as he licked the corner of my lips. As he rubs hard to my clothed shaft. I start to breathe heavily and panting hard.

As his hand’s wonder at my back and help me removed my shirt as I did the same with him.Seungcheol lips immediately found my nipple as he sucks it hard. At the same time his otherwise hand playes wonders to my other nipple.

As my clothes was disregarded he rubbed his shaft at my opening.“Jeonghan I want you to moan my name while I bring you to heaven.”I nodded and guided his shaft inside of me without any prep or lube. We both curser because of the sensation. I grip seungcheol at shoulder once I adjust to his member inside of me. And began to moves and grinds at him.“You look so fucking good on top of me, Jeonghan.” Seungcheol copper my cheeks for an open kiss as I moved faster and rougher on top of him. And Seungcheol starta to bucks his hip upwards meeting the rhyme I made.Seungcheol licks and bites my skin that I know will leave a mark on the following day, but I don’t care.We are both lost in ecstasy.“I’m close seungcheol.”“Me too.” Seungcheol let out a soft growl and harshly bucks up his hips and mercilessly gave a handjob. I moaned and clenched around him as we both reach our euphoria.“Round two at my place?”",1
"Albedo and Kaeya were lost in the wilderness, surrounded by snow and ice. They had been on a mission to explore the frozen wasteland, but a sudden blizzard had separated them from their team. With the temperature dropping rapidly, they took shelter in a cave, huddling together for warmth.As they lay there, Albedo couldn't help but feel a stir of desire for Kaeya. The way his body pressed against his, the heat they generated together, it was all too much. Without a word, they began to kiss, their bodies entwining in a frenzy of passion.As they made love in the snow, Albedo noticed something strange. Kaeya's member had turned a pale, bluish color, and was rapidly losing feeling. Albedo knew what this meant- frostbite. He tried to stop, but Kaeya begged him to continue, to finish what they had started.In the heat of the moment, Albedo didn't realize the gravity of the situation. It wasn't until they had finished that he saw the full extent of the damage. Kaeya's member had turned black, and was clearly dead tissue. It would have to be amputated.Without hesitation, Albedo offered to give Kaeya his own member. Kaeya was shocked, but grateful. In a gruesome and painful procedure, Albedo had his member removed, and transplanted onto Kaeya's body.As they lay there, recovering from the surgery, Albedo realized the sacrifice he had made. He would never again be able to experience the pleasure of sex, but he had given that gift to Kaeya. It was a small price to pay for the love they shared, and the lengths they were willing to go to for each other.In the end, they emerged from the wilderness as heroes, having completed their mission and saved each other's lives.

"Chapter 1. The ending.It was over. It was finally over. They had won, the fireworks were going off, they had survived. Altho for a certain few people it wasn’t over.. they were fighting for their life. Especially kuina lying next to a now unresponsive Ann.“Promise if we ever meet again… we’ll be friends” was the last words Ann had managed to get out before her breathing slowed. Kuina looked over to her, scared when she saw Ann not moving or saying anything to the point where she couldn’t bring herself to respond.Eventually kuina reached out her hand with everything left in her, as she gently took Ann’s hand into her own. “Let’s go back together” was the last thing she said before everything went to black.",1
"Oliver and Luc's argument had been brewing for days, and it finally reached its boiling point. The tension between them was palpable as they stood in the middle of Oliver's apartment, each one refusing to back down.Oliver raised his hand as a gesture, hoping to calm Luc down, but instead of relaxing, Luc flinched away from him, as if expecting to be hit.Hit. Oliver would never hit him. What the hell?.""Luc, Calm down,"" Oliver said, his voice full of concern.But it was too late. Luc was already trembling, his breaths coming in short, panicked gasps. He stumbled backward, collapsing onto the couch, clutching his chest.Oliver's heart sank as he realized what was happening. Luc was having a panic attack. It wasn't new to him, but this... This was raw and unadulterated panic. He needed to calm Luc down. Now.He rushed to Luc's side, taking him in his arms and holding him close. ""Ssshhh. Lucien, baby,"" he murmured stroking his hair, ""Breathe. Breathe Lucien.""Damn it! It wasn't helping.""Lucien. Lucien, baby, can you hear me? If you can, nod, okay?""He knew it was only seconds before he felt the slight movement of his boyfriend's head, but it felt like hours. But when he did feel it, a wave of relief ran through him. At least Luc could hear him.Oliver placed Luc against his chest. ""Breathe with me, okay?"" he said softly""One, two three, three two one.""It felt like years as Oliver and Luc remained collapsed on the sofa, Luc curled into Oliver, who was cradling him in his arms. They counted together, once, twice, thrice, until Oliver lost count. All he knew was that he needed to help Luc. Gradually, Luc's breathing slowed, and the panic attack subsided. Oliver helped him up and put him to bed, making sure he was comfortable before tucking him in.He sat there next to Lucien for a few minutes, running his hands through his lover's hair and gently caressing his cheek. He didn't know how much time passed, but eventually, he got up with a sigh, heading to get ready for bed himself.++As Oliver lay in bed that night, he couldn't help but feel guilty. He had never meant to scare Luc, and he vowed to treat him better in the future. He tried to get the mental images of his boyfriend suffering out of his head, and somehow succeeded.++The next morning, Oliver made French toast for breakfast, hoping to make amends. He stood there waiting with plates in hand, and Luc walked down the stairs in his shorts. He didn't look good, but he did look better than yesterday. He served the food and smiled silently as Lucien's face brightened. As they ate, Oliver brought up the previous day's incident.Luc... Chuckled. ""Oh, that~~, it's no big deal. The big deal is that I haven't got any Dick picks for-""""Luc. It is a big deal to me. I want to know."" Oliver interrupted.Luc laughed again, ""Ya but the di-""""Luc.""Luc's eyes zoned in on him. Oliver almost toppled out of his seat when he saw that intense glare.""Well, I warned you. You wanna know, you really wanna know?"" Oliver nodded. ""Well, Miles ruined my life in more ways than one. He didn't just enjoy those fifty books, he was also an abusive ass bitch who made my life a living fucking hell."" Then... Luc's eyes welled up with tears, and he glared at Oliver as tears rolled down his cheeks. Oliver was shocked – he had never seen Luc cry before.""Happy now? Got your information."" Luc spat. Still speechless, Oliver reached for him, but Luc dodged.""I'll be in the living room if you want me,"" he murmured, walking out the door.Oliver wanted to go after him, but he needed time to process what he'd just heard.Oliver's heart ached and burned at the same time. That bastard Miles had dared to hurt the kindest, most caring man on the planet. Miles had hurt Luc, broken him, and Oliver hated him for that. Apnd Luc... he didn't deserve what he'd been through.He absent-mindedly made his way to the kitchen and prepared a steaming mug of hot chocolate. He made his way to the living room, only to find Lucien of the couch, STILL CRYING. That Miles was a real bastard. He made his way to Lucien.""Baby.. Lucien.""  Oliver mumbled quietly. Luc pointedly looked away from him.""Lucien.. I didn't mean to pry. I was worried. I apologize.""Luc sighed and shifted over, giving Oliver space to sit. Oliver sat next to him, wrapiing his arms around Luc carefully. They sat there in silence. They stayed there, Luc lying in Olivers arms, finishing his mug. Oliver stood up to keep the mug by the sink, but just as he was nearing the doorway, a voice from behind him said, ""Now, about the dick pics.""Oliver turned and smiled at his boyfriend. Miles might have hurt him, broken him, but Luc, he was strong. They would make it out of this mess. Together. He turned on his heel, moving to get back to the sofa. The cup could wait.",1
"B helped Pip get dressed in his underwear and into the bed as the drunk man was now sober. B then joined him on the opposite side of the bed, respecting his space and boundaries. After a while of silence, Pip broke it with a question. “B?” He asked, the only response he got was a grunt before adding. “ Can we fuck together?” He proposed, which made B pop his head up and quickly turn to him. His face was excited but uncertain.“Are you serious?” He questioned while Pip nodded and took off his underwear, revealing his cock. B flustered heavily and crawled over to him. After a minute of B taking off his underwear, he was ready, but saw that Pip didn’t know what to do. “Pip? Do you need help?” He asked while Pip just laid there.“Just show me.” Pip replied, which caused B to shrug before reaching down and squeeze his cock, causing Pip to whimper in pleasure. His lover then placed his mouth over his dick and started sucking, which caused him to giggle in enjoyment. Once B had his fill of sucking his love’s dick, he then decided to thrust a bit while sucking one of Pip’s nipples. It made the latter moan and mumble his name. When he finished, they both were catching their breath and sweating. “Well?” B asked as he snuggled into Pip’s neck, the younger man giggled with delight as he enjoyed every minute of it.“Can we do it again? But can I suck your dick this time as well?” He asked with puppy eyes, causing B to chuckle while gently caressing his love’s hips.“Alright.” He replied as he started to thrust again, causing Pip to moan in pleasure and delight while looking at B lovingly.“I love you.” He said in between breaths, which caused B to stop and look at him briefly before kissing his lips passionately. Pip giggled before he decided to tease B a bit.“Come on, Handsome! I want to try your cock out!” He complained lovingly before B laid beside him.“Go on then.” He said encouragingly, which gave him the confidence to do it. Pip cautiously put his mouth on his dick and started to suck. The moment the semen touched his tongue, he realized it actually tasted very good, and wanted more of it. So he continued to suck harder which made his lover moan a bit before he got his fill. B rolled his eyes as Pip lazily fell back in the bed, and put the covers over him. B reached over and kissed his cheek with a smile.“Goodnight, love. I’m glad you enjoyed our intimate night together.” He stated as he was about to go back to his side of the bed. Pip then grabbed his arm with a grin on his face. “Do you want to snuggle together for the rest of the night?” He asked, not really wanting this night of fun to end. B smiled as he scooted over to his love, wrapping his arms around him as they both drift off to sleep.",1
"Jacob and Haknyeon had been keeping a secret from their group, The Boyz. They were both omegas, but they didn't want anyone to know. The rest of the group were all alphas, and they didn't want to be treated differently because of their status. One day, they were caught by the media. They were both shocked and terrified. They knew what would happen once their secret was out. They would be discriminated against and looked down upon by the public. Jacob paced back and forth in their shared dorm room, while Haknyeon sat on his bed, staring blankly at the wall. They were both lost in thought until Jacob broke the silence.""We're screwed, Haknyeon. There's no way we can hide this from the public now.""Haknyeon didn't respond, still lost in his thoughts. Jacob continued, ""We've worked so hard to get to where we are. We can't let this ruin everything.""Haknyeon finally spoke up, ""What are we supposed to do? We can't change who we are. We were born this way.""Jacob sighed, ""I know. But we can't let the public know. It'll ruin our careers.""Haknyeon looked up at Jacob, ""Do you think the other members know?""Jacob shook his head, ""I don't think so. They would have said something by now.""Haknyeon stood up from his bed, ""We can't keep this a secret forever. Eventually, someone will find out. We have to face the consequences.""Jacob looked at Haknyeon with tears in his eyes, ""I don't want to lose everything. The fans, the music, The Boyz.

Jacob and Haknyeon could feel the discrimination and judgment from their fellow alphas in the group. They were excluded from certain activities and conversations. They could feel the tension between them and the rest of the group. One day, while they were practicing their choreography, one of the other members made a comment about their omega status. Jacob and Haknyeon froze, their hearts pounding in their chests.""You know, I never would have guessed you two were omegas.

We didn't want to be treated differently.""The other member looked at them coldly, ""Well, now you have no choice. You're omegas, and that's all anyone will see."" Jacob and Haknyeon exchanged a worried glance, knowing that their lives would never be the same.

"As Sam Winchester drove his older brothers car he thought about how long Dean took to confess to “Father”.

“Y’know you took a while in that confession stand.” Sam said as he drove down the highway, his voice amused. He glanced at Dean to see a pondering look on his face. “So you gonna tell me.” Dean chuckled and swatted Sams arm jokingly before letting the quietness fill the car.“Sam I-“ Dean started before stopping and rubbing his hand through his hair. Sam looked at his brother in worry. “I told some pretty big secrets to that guy.” Dean looked around nervously.“Okay, like what?” Sam asked feeling a little worried about his brothers behaviour.“You know how I got blackout drunk and said I was in-love.” Sam nodded remembering that night, or more so remembering walking Dean towards his bed. “So I might be  and I’ve only realized it now.” Sam laughed smiling.“That’s good right.” Dean just looked out the window solemnly. “Dean who is it.” Sam asked curiosity in his voice.“It’s someone I didn’t expect.” Dean said with a small laugh. Sam looked at Dean.“So who is it.” Sam knew who he wanted it to be. The weird awkward angel Dean is always watching.“It’s Cas.” Dean said quietly getting prepared for Sam to blowup like their dad did when Dean first came out.“I knew it.” Sam said smiling widely, and laughing. Dean was shocked and confused.“What do you mean “You knew it”?” Dean asked Sam in a dangerous tone. Sam giggles at those words.“Please you’re obvious , Castiel looks at you like you hung the stars.” Sam said as he continued to list off things Cas only does for him.“Wait hold up there, I’m obvious but what about Cas. Do you think he knew.” Dean said worryingly, if he knew what would he think of Dean.“Nah he’s worse than you, I think he thinks that you’re just always horny.” Dean swatted Sam’s arm again and just laughed.“I was worried for no reason huh?” He asked himself before looking at Sam and seeing him nodding his head. “Whatever man.” Though none of theWinchesters noticed an invisible happy Castiel in the back of the car. “I love you too Dean.” He whispered quietly.",1

""Hey, wait up Y/n!"" a voice said, saddened. ""Do you really have to go away? I mean, it's cold up there!""
""I know, but it's because my mom got a dumb job up in New York. But let's stay in contact, yeah?"" Y/n said with a comforting smile spreading on his face.

As Y/n's friend, Mark, hugged him, Y/n couldn't help but hug back. ""I promise I'll contact you every morning, advisory, evening, and fill you in on tea."" Mark promised.
'Bullshit' Y/n thought as he stared through the backseat window of his mother's SUV, remembering that moment. ""Remind me why you got a job in New York, again?"" he asked his mother, though irritated.""Well, cuz it's a better pay than that crummy joint off the corner,"" his mom responded, using a happy and sickeningly soft voice. 'No need to act like I didn't know you worked at the drug store' Y/n stated mentally.""Come on Y/d/n, this'll be a good change from being anti-social!"" His dad suggested ""besides, you can finally make some friends"" ""Yeah, maybe even find a boy"" his mom teased ""Mom! I struggle with school anyways, plus this move, why would I have time to be around a guy?"" Y/n panickedIt was true, Y/n wouldn't have time to hang out with a guy his age, but if his mom got one thing right, it's that he does like guys. But if it wasn't for him being ripped away from his home life, he would've been fine with the idea of 'finding a boy'.He checked his phone for any new texts or missed calls. 'Of course he wouldn't send anything' he thought. 'People truly suck.'A few hours fly by like minutes. ""Why didn't we just fly to New York?"" Y/n complained. ""Because it's cheaper"" his dad stated, but Y/n didn't believe it.""We're here!"" His mom exclaimed as they pulled up to an apartment in New York. Y/n got out and took in the surroundings. It was currently 10 o'clock at night, so it was ""dark."" But in reality, the New York lights lit up the streets like it was day time.""Now go get ready for bed, Y/d/n. You got a busy day at your new school tomorrow,"" his dad stated. 'Great..' Y/n thought to himself and went inside their new apartment. 'Just peachy...'",1
"Dupe was new to the hotel, so it wasn't very familiar with the fellow entities who reside here. In fact, she only really knew Jeff, Bob, Snare, and El Goblino, due to them all coming from the same place, Jeff also being Dupe's cousin. It did know of three interesting entities. The first one, being named Rush. He was very fast and very loud. He was quite annoying to Dupe, but his sister not as much. Rush's sister, Ambush, had caught Dupe's eyes. She admired her, despite being loud and annoying like her brother, Ambush was actually successful in killing intruders quite frequently. When not on the job, Ambush knew how to calm down, unlike her obnoxious brother. It's likely due to maturity difference, but Dupe didn't like Rush regardless. The third entity was Rush's best friend, and also equally annoying, Screech. Dupe didn't interact with Screech much, due to it just being there, while Screech was actively biting players, and when off duty Screech would be hanging out with Rush or his fathers, which Dupe hadn't seen much of. She'd only been there for 3 weeks, so hopefully she'll meet them soon. It knew that the ""Guiding Light"" fellow planned on hosting a meeting to properly introduce the 5 new entities once the heightened flow of trespassers calmed down, so their shifts would be shorter, leaving more time to interact properly. The feline-adjacent entity was hiding behind her door as usual, just hanging out, really, due to shift being over, when it heard a knock. It hesitated slightly, before opening her door. To it's surprise, it was Ambush. She stands up a little more properly, due to the sudden presence of someone it actually respected. The entity in front of it then began speaking, ""Hello. Um.. Dupe, yes?"" She seemed quite socially awkward, which made Dupe loosen up a bit, knowing she didn't have to be on high alert near her. ""Yes, Dupe. Your name is Ambush, correct?"" It asks, making sure she's correct. ""Yes, I'm Ambush... Um. I'm here to show you around a little.. if you wish."" The shorter entity spoke again. Dupe perks up at the chance to actually get familiar, and agrees to it, swiftly making her way through it's door. Ambush takes Dupe's claw, as to guide it, but the sudden touch makes her flustered, with Dupe already crushing, but Ambush couldn't like it back, right? It barely knows them, plus, she's it's coworker for fucks sake! Dupe has to stay strictly professional! Little did she know, not only was Ambush feeling the exact same, but she'd done it on purpose. However, if she needed an excuse, ""to guide"" always works. Making sure the taller entity doesn't get left behind. As Ambush was touring the hotel for Dupe, she was surprised that they hadn't run into any other entities yet. I wonder what's happening.Rush knew exactly what Ambush was doing. He'd planned so she'd go and see Dupe, show it around the hotel, and they'd fall in love. And why would Rush do this? Because his sister was a useless lesbian who had nobody to be useless with. He was a good brother deep down, so he made sure that no other entities would interrupt the two, by of course, all gathering in one room for the entirety of their time together, as to not disturb the idiotic gays at work. All the other entities, huddled up at door 100, was not a good idea. Everyone was doing their own things, with Seek attempting to help Figure calm down from all the noise in one corner, Eyes and Halt doing whatever the fuck they do in another, Jack and Hide occupying a closet together, Screech annoying everyone, but for the most part everyone was minding their own business, likely annoyed because of the shitty situation. But anything for love, I guess.As the duo reached the Courtyard, they couldn't help but stop and admire it. ""Jack really does a good job taking care of the plants out here, hm?"" Ambush mumbles to herself. ""Jack does all of this?"" Dupe questions, not knowing much about the entity, but not expecting him to be the gardening type. ""Yeah. He's talented."" She speaks, her voice smooth as ice. Dupe admired Ambush's voice, alongside the life of the Courtyard. ""Your voice is really cute, you know."" Dupe mutters, hoping Ambush didn't hear her. Dupe looks up to see Ambush's ""face"" flushed. 'Oh god,' it thought. 'Why did I say that? She wouldn't like me! I'm just-' before getting cut off by Ambush, ""Thank.. you."" She said, obviously flustered. ""N.. no problem."" Dupe replied. They just stood there, staring at god knows what, before Ambush spoke again. ""Well... We should get going, hm?"" Dupe nodded, and the duo took hands and made their way back to Dupe's door.Finally, after traversing the many many doors, they'd reached their destination. ""This was... fun, I'll see you around?"" Dupe said. Ambush nodded, before speaking, ""Of course, I also thought this was.. enjoyable."" Before pulling Dupe in for a small kiss on the cheek. ""Toodles!"" Ambush teased while walking off, leaving Dupe flustered. 'That was.. woah.' Dupe thought.  PLS GIVE FEEDBACK I DONT WRITE SHIT LIKE THIS OFTEN 😭😭😭 -🚪",1

Saskia woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep, after a few failed attempts she got off her bed and headed outside for some fresh air, she didn't expect to see Genevieve also awake and smoking a cigarette by the balustrade.""Those are bad for you, you know.""Genevieve was so startled she dropped the cigarette. ""For fuck’s sake! Are you trying to kill me?!""""Sorry."" Saskia grabbed the cigarette from the floor and gave it back to Genevieve. ""You really shouldn't smoke these.""""It’s not like you to care Saskia.""  Genevieve looked at Saskia sincerely confused that the brunette was even talking to her.""Still, I don't want to loose more women than we already have.""""Oh, that makes more sense, I’m just another body in the Saskia survival army, right?"" Genevieve immediately regretted her choice of words, she could see how hurt and disheartened Saskia actually looked.""Genevieve, can we not do this right now, can't we just have a normal conversation, for once.""""I’m sorry. I guess I’m too wired up. Yesterday was… fucked up."" Genevieve finally admitted, they were both exhausted and there was no point in fighting anymore.""Yeah… I couldn't sleep.""""You’ve never killed or butchered anyone before? I would have thought it to be mandatory to join your little cool girls gang. I’m shocked.""""Genevieve!"" Saskia was about to go off on Genevieve but when she actually looked at the taller woman she saw her smile and the twinke in her eyes, she was just joking, she just wasn't used to seeing this side of Genevieve. ""We weren't a gang, nor did we murder or butcher anyone.""""Not literally. So what would I have to do to join your little TC gang?""""Again, not a gang! But you’re halfway there, cigarettes, breaking curfew, leaving the school in the middle of the night.""""Halfway?! What would I have to do to be fully in?""""Well, you need booze and make out with someone in the fingering bench.""""Booze? You mean like this?"" Genevieve asked while showing the whisky bottle she was hiding behind her back.""How drunk are you already?""""Not drunk enough to make out with you.""""Are you saying you would have to be drunk to make out with me? Do you find me that repulsive?""""You know very well that your looks isn't what I find repulsive.""""So you do find me attractive?""""I might wear glasses but I’m not blind.""Suddenly the mood shifted, Saskia grabbed the bottle from Genevieve's hands and took a long sip.""So, how bad do you want to join the cool girls gang tonight?""Genevieve was actually speechless for a moment, she needed to be sure Saskia meant what she was saying, ""I thought it wasn't a gang?""""Do you want in or not?""Genevieve didn't wait for an answer, she grabbed a hold of Saskia’s shirt and pulled her towards her, kissing her intensely. In a matter of seconds the cigarette and the booze were forgotten. Genevieve’s hands were otherwise busy fucking Saskia against the balustrade.This was something Genevieve was exceptionally skilled at and she would show Saskia just how good she was. Her hands and mouth were everywhere, there wasn't an inch of Saskia’s body Genevieve hadn't touched.Saskia’s first orgasm came quickly, surprising both women and afterwards Genevieve took her time, she knew she would never get to do this again and decided to enjoy it. She found out that Saskia’s breasts were very sensitive and she would shiver whenever she licked the tips with her tongue, she also found out Saskia was ticklish around her hips and she would catch her breathe whenever Genevieve would brush her fingers against it.In the end Saskia came three more times with Genevieve’s fingers between her legs and she could barely catch her breath.Genevieve let her recover in her arms, against her chest.""Are you okay?""""Yeah, that was… good.""""Good? I just gave you four orgasms, how many of your lovers can say that?""""Uh… not many.""When Saskia had her strength back Genevieve took a step away from the brunette and grabbed the whisky bottle on the floor, she took a quick sip before turning back to Saskia.""It’s late, I’m going back to my room and try to get some sleep.""""What? But don’t you want me to… return the favor."" Saskia was shocked and a little bit pissed that Genevieve was just walking away.""I’m fine. Good night Saskia""And for the first time in forever Saskia was lost for words.",1

It was a hot summer day in Verona, and Tybalt was in a bad mood. He had been out practicing his swordsmanship all morning, but nothing seemed to go right. He had lost his focus, and his movements were sloppy. He sheathed his sword in frustration and sat down on a nearby bench, staring at the ground.""Hey, Tybalt! What's got you so down?"" Mercutio said as he approached Tybalt.""Nothing,"" Tybalt grumbled, not looking up.""Come on, Tybalt, don't be like that. Tell me what's wrong,"" Mercutio persisted.""It's just...I don't know. I can't seem to get anything right today,"" Tybalt admitted.""Ah, I see. Well, how about a friendly spar? That always cheers you up,"" Mercutio suggested, grinning.Tybalt rolled his eyes but stood up nonetheless. ""Fine. But don't go easy on me.""Mercutio chuckled. ""You know me better than that.""The two drew their swords and began their dance. Tybalt felt himself relax as his body remembered the familiar movements. He began to focus, and his movements became fluid and precise.Mercutio was a worthy opponent, and the two of them fought fiercely. But as they danced, Tybalt noticed something different about Mercutio. His movements were more playful, less aggressive than usual. There was a lightness in his step that Tybalt had never seen before.Tybalt felt a sudden surge of emotion he couldn't quite name. He had never thought of Mercutio in that way before, but as he watched him move, he couldn't help but feel drawn to him.The spar came to an end as they both lowered their swords, breathing heavily. Tybalt looked at Mercutio, wanting to say something but not quite knowing what",1
"Zeta gazes at the sheet in front of her, covering the body underneath. Emotions she had not felt for centuries bubble under the surface the longer she stares. Whispers of Hatred and Darkness echo throughout her mind as she falls deeper and deeper into her mind.“A corpse should be left alone.” Her words startle her companion, Zavala, who gazed at her for a short time before returning his gaze to the sheet. “Why do you say that?”, he asks her, his eyes filled with confusion as she pats him on the shoulder. “I say this from experience Zavala. A corpse, should it be disturbed, will never find rest even after the reason of its disturbance is dead.” Her response is cold, detached from her usual motherly tone of voice that seemed to warm the hearts of many.A feeling of dread fills Zavala upon hearing these words, what had this woman seen in her time as a Risen? “Why tell me this, Zeta?”, his question echoes out in the small area they stand. Her response is something that chills him to his bones, no, beyond his physical body and into his soul.“Because I am a corpse that should have been left alone Zavala. The Witness whispers to me even now to rip and tear through all of you and become a Disciple. But I will not let myself fall to the Darkness, not after what happened the first time I Fell. I slaughtered my way through countless Guardians to get to the one that made me Fall. I made the Fall and have yet to Rise as was ordained by The Witness, Zavala.” She sighs before turning away from the the sheet and Zavala, walking towards where her ship is waiting.She calls out over her shoulder to Zavala as one last word to him as a Risen much, much older than him. “Do not let Rage cloud your thoughts Zavala, the City needs you in this trying time. I am merely an old Exo that has been alive for too long, I can allow myself to Fall as much as is needed. Let me deal with the child’s killers Zavala. You must grieve after all, grief is a good thing to have as it means you are healing from Tragedy.”The sound of her transmatting onto her ship echoes through The Farm, the sound of her ship leaving sounds out shortly after. Letting Zavala know he is now alone to his grief.",1
"Heyyyy thereI've been away for a long time, for which I'm so so sorry.I totally haven't had the energy to write anything for the last couple of weeks, and still the lack of vengenance is hopeless.WELL, BUT I'M BACK. I HOPE FOR LONGER AND MORE OFTEN BUT WE WILL SEE.I have a few chapters of Happiness of Felicity so I will edit them and update as soon as possible.And right away I want to apologize to the people who gave me some promst on Tumblr, I will write it just want to focus on my own ideas first. But if I get an idea on how to write it I will do it for you.But other than that I have an idea for a new fanfiction, and I would like to ask if you guys would like it.SooooI want to do a crossover of the Rookie and Arrow, of course with olicity and chenford, but that would happen later.The plot was that Tim and his sister Genny would go to a foster family and have happy childhood. And there would be Felicity who went to the same foster family because, e.g. donna blamed her for her husband leaving or something like that, we'll see. Well then Tim, Genny and Felicity would be siblings. And it wouldn't really change much, the plot of Arrow and the Rookie would be canonical they would just be slightly connected.So, let me know if you like it and if you have any suggestions, I'd welcome anything.",1

If someone had looked towards the Black Lake in the morning, they would have seen a soaked figure come out of it. Upon closer inspection, he would have realized that it was one of the Hogwarts students. She herself didn't know who she was. She wasn't sure how she got there and why she was trapped at the bottom of the lake. She tried to help the ginger boy who seemed familiar to her. However, she couldn't. She was interrupted by creatures she saw for the first time in her life.Confused, she walked towards the trees. Subconsciously, she felt that she would be safe there. She wasn't sure if that feeling was right. It wasn't long before she disappeared without a trace in the darkness of the Forbidden Forest.xxxEveryone was watching the four contestants of the Triwizard Tournament. However, all Viktor Krum could think of was that Hermione was nowhere to be seen. None of her friends knew where she was. He even went so far as to ask a blond wizard about her, who seemed to always know where she should be. He didn’t know.He was pulled out of his thoughts by the voice of the commentator - “...And for Viktor Krum it is Miss Hermione Granger!!!”He cursed as he realized what was happening. What was taken from them wasn't things. People who were dear to their hearts were taken from them. He quickly performed a partial transfiguration and jumped into the lake. The water was turbid. Not such as he had seen in the lakes of his homeland. Still, he was the first to reach the hostages.Something was wrong.He saw Mr. Potter's ginger friend. He saw the girl who accompanied Mr. Diggory to the Yule Ball. And Fleur's younger sister. Hermione wasn't there.After a moment he saw the end of the rope floating freely in the water. The same rope to which the other hostages were attached.xxxLucius could feel his son's body trembling. He didn't understand his sentiments towards the girl, but he understood the uneasiness his son felt about fearing for her safety. He tried to explain to Draco that he shouldn't be worried. He tried to tell him that the potion that was given to the hostages was made by Severus Snape. He tried… But after a while, he started to worry too. The end of the hour allotted for the task was approaching and none of the contestants emerged to the surface.“Father…”He looked at his wife, who seemed to be thinking the same thing. After this task, they will have to talk about what to do with their son's growing affection for a Muggleborn girl in the context of the Dark Lord's impending return.xxxHe trembled as he stepped out onto the shores of Black Lake. He felt awkward that he was being helped by Hermione's friend, who looked like he was about to fall apart himself. The younger wizard repeated one question like a mantra. - “Where she is?”The Headmaster of Hogwarts, accompanied by Igor Karakov, ran up to them. Before the head of his institute could say anything, Albus Dumbledore asked one question. A question he could only give one answer to.“Where is Miss Granger?”“She's not there. The others helped me look for her. Hermione Granger isn’t in Black Lake”",1

B.R.A.I.N read over the instructions one last time. This had to be perfect. It looked down at the doll in his claws, It was a perfect copy of a stitchpunk. It had been difficult to put together due to its much smaller size compared to B.R.A.I.N. There had been several failed attempts but finally it was ready. Or ready enough. The small doll’s optics were not the same as his real counterpart. They could not close. Forever stuck wide and in a hexagonal shape. B.R.A.I.N just hoped that the stitchpunks were to stupid to notice. They probably were.
There was one last detail B.R.A.I.N wanted to add. It got out a red fabric. One that had once been a blanket. It had been burned. Results of the stitchpunks attack on its factory. The blanket had once belonged to the scientist that created B.R.A.I.N and the stitchpunks. B.R.A.I.N started to cut the blanket into a smaller shape then sewed it onto the doll. It copied the cape 1 had worn so proudly perfectly. It was missing the jewel but that didn’t matter. It was a small detail that would certainly go unnoticed.
It was ready. B.R.A.I.N zapped it and put it down, waiting for its creation to come to life. After a few moments the doll moved. It sitting up and staring at it’s creator. It’s wide eyes alone made him feel much younger than who it was based on. Then it did something that surprised it’s creator. It smiled. None of B.R.A.I.N other creations had even acknowledged it. They just instantly set off to do their job. B.R.A.I.N had expected this latest creation to act differently of course. It was created to mimic the first stitchpunk but B.R.A.I.N had expected it to run off like the rest. Slowly B.R.A.I.N sent a claw down to the fake stitchpunk and gently patted it. Creating copies of the stitchpunks was going to be… interesting.",1

Ricks head perked up at the sound of the front door shutting down the hall of the home, the pitter patter of Carls footsteps running up the stairs after greeting rick with a quick, ""Hi dad!"" as he ran off to his bedroom, most likely to get started on his homework. Negan soon appeared around the corner, stretching his arms into the air with a drawn out, over dramatic groan followed by a sigh as he approached Rick, wrapping his arms around his husband's waist, nuzzling his nose into the crook of where Ricks shoulder and neck connected. One of the things Rick had loved most about Negan was his overpowerful spirit and how dramatic and bouncy he could be even with the dullest of situations, one of the many things that had made the Officer fall head over heels for the man who now held onto him.Negan took a deep inhale of Ricks soft skin and sighed against it, pressing a gentle kiss to his neck as he spoke, ""You smell good,"" he murmured gently, earning a warm smile from rick who hummed in response, placing the lid over the pot he was just stirring not too long ago, ""Hello to you too,"" he greeted in amusement, leaning back against Negan's chest with a soft sigh, letting his eyes fall closed in a sense of comfort in the man's grasp that tightened slightly around his waist.""Did ya just shower?""
""I did, after I got off my shift an hour or so ago,"" Rick responded turning his head to the left to press a gentle kiss to Negan's cheek,
""you buy new body wash?"" Negan pestered, opening up his eyes to lazily gaze up at Rick through his eyelids, giving a squished smile from where his face was pressed into Ricks shoulder who chuckled and brought a hand up to cup the side of Negan's face ""you went shopping with me, shouldn't you know?"" he asked, gently rubbing his thumb affectionately across the salt and pepper stubble along Negan's jaw.
Negan scrunched his nose and stood up straight behind rick now, peering over the top of ricks head at the stove ""right as rain! and it smells lovely, but, y'know what smells even better?"" He asked, resting his chin atop ricks head who gave a huff and crossed his arms, ""Negan,"" he started in a warning tone, ""I know spaghetti is your favorite but don't you dar-,"" Rick began, but was soon cut off by Negan letting go and reaching past rick to lift the lid off the pot on the stove, gently waving it to waft the steamy smell of the cooking pasta into the air as he took a large inhale, a sly grin spreading across his face as he sighed heavily, chest dropping as he did, sinking against the counter, ""spaghetti!"" he announced, proud of himself while Rick watched, turning his head away to hide the smile he couldn't force himself to hold back,
""Ah!"" Negan sputtered, pushing off the counter, placing the lid back in it's designated spot, ""Rick grimes!"" he gasped again, placing his hand over his chest in mock offense, ""Did I just get you to smile??"" ""And you're hiding it from me?"" Negan teased in a half whine, reaching forward to grab hold of his husbands' shoulders who fought back and refused to look at Negan stubbornly, trying to keep his lips pressed in a straight line but he couldn't help the corners of his mouth fighting back in a downturned smile, ""Riiiick~"" Negan cooed in a sing song tone, reaching one hand up to take hold of ricks chin between his thumb and index finger, ""Come on baby, look at me with that pretty smile of yours,"" he coaxed, rick turning the direction Negan led him and smiled at him, ""You are terrible."" RIck told him through laughter, pulling out of Negan's grasp, ""And you smell like Sweat and rubber from being at the School all day,"" Rick stated, poking Negan in the chest who just stared down at Rick with the most adoring smile as he listened to every word Rick said, ""you are so nice to me"" Negan said sarcastically, leaning down enough to place his hand on the small of ricks back pulling rick forward into a sweet, delicate kiss that Rick returned, breaking it to press a kiss to Negans nose, ""go shower"" he told him, earning a salute and a ""Yes sir,"" from Negan who snuck another kiss to ricks forehead, ""I love you""
""I love you too Negan.""",1
"After a long day of work and chores, they were tired. Tired and pent up, having retreated to their room for the night after dinner. Ready to rest and relax, and of course, have each other before bed. No day would be complete without a quick de-stressing session of intimacy, after all. Not when they were so pent up, having given each other needy bedroom eyes all day, truly longer for the moment when they would be alone and behind closed doors.
 
But as much as they wanted to have each other, it seemed that fate had other plans. Because as they tried to initiate things, everything slowly heated up as the excitement built up between them, fate had decided that it was a hilarious idea to let Pepa annoy them today.
 
Over and over, as Julieta quickly found a growing resentment for her sister inside of her. Because it was clear from the way she acted and her expression that she was doing this specifically to annoy them and to disturb them, all for her own joy of messing with them. It was vile, and in Julieta’s current pent up state, it was unforgivable.
 
Pepa was preventing her from getting something she needed, and she swore that if she continued, that she would get her revenge. She wouldn’t let things go unpunished. Because out of all the days that Pepa could decide to annoy them, why would it have to be 

today 

when Julieta wanted to 

throw 

herself at Agustín?”
 
It started while things were just getting good. The two of them sealed in a fierce kiss, hands running over each other’s bodies. Agustín’s shirt had been thrown aside, and in the middle of their needy kisses, Agustín had been about to pull Julieta’s skirt down.
 
Then Pepa had arrived, slamming the door open as loud as she could and simply waltzed in, causing them to freeze up in startled confusion as she walked into their room towards her vanity. All to annoy them. They knew.




“Don’t mind me. I’m just borrowing Julieta’s hairbrush.”
 
She got it and left.
 
Julieta and Agustín stare at each other for a moment and then groan in frustration. Now the moment was partially ruined, and they would have to start all over to build things up.
 
They do, as they continue to kiss each other roughly, and Julieta’s skirt is indeed thrown aside. A few minutes of kissing, touching and petting pass, and just as things are about to get good again with her trying to remove Agustín’s pants, Pepa interrupts 

again, 

slamming the door open once more as they are startled.
 

Why?

 
Couldn’t a pent up married woman try to have sex in peace?
 
“I’m just returning the hairbrush. Don’t mind me.”
 
Julieta swore that she had never hated her sister as much as she did this very moment. This was incredibly cruel.
 
Pepa leaves once more, causing Julieta to groan as she grasps at the sheets, the nice buildup gone once more. Was having sex with her husband before bed too much to ask for in this household?
 
She knew Pepa was doing it to disturb them and to annoy them. And it made her feel spite. She gritted her teeth in annoyance.
 
Once more, she begins to kiss Agustín, refusing to give up. She wasn’t going to let Pepa win this fight. But after just two more minutes of kissing, she hadn’t even managed to remove his pants yet. And just as she was about to do so, Pepa burst in for a third time.
 
“Now I need to borrow your lipstick.”
 
Julieta felt her blood boil.
 
Pepa was going to pay. And she was going to make sure to finally have a lock installed to her room. That would keep her out for good.
 
If she did this once more… then… then Julieta would lose it completely. She couldn’t take this anymore. Not when she needed Agustín so badly.
 
She leaves once more, and 

finally 

Julieta continues to kiss Agustín. Their hands run over each other, and this time they do have time to remove his pants. And her bloomers. She feels the excitement of 

finally 

being able to have him, just a little more. Soon all of her pent up needs would be gone, and she would get what she desired. Oh, how she craved him.
 
Then 

she 

bursts into the room for a fourth time.
 
A fourth 

fucking time. 

Interrupting them once more, as Agustín quickly pulls the covers over them since they’re now nude.
 
“Now I need your hairbrush again.”
 
Julieta had enough.


“Pepa, you are dying in your sleep tonight. 

Let me have sex in peace!”",1
"Obi-Wan Kenobi stood at the edge of the molten lava pit on Mustafar, staring down at the twisted, burned form of his former apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, now known as Darth Vader.The two had fought a fierce battle, one that had left them both badly wounded. Obi-Wan had managed to gain the upper hand, but as he looked down at the battered, broken body of his once-beloved Padawan, he felt no sense of triumph.Instead, he felt a deep sense of sadness and regret. He had failed Anakin, had failed to prevent him from falling to the dark side and becoming the Sith Lord, Darth Vader. And now, he was faced with the impossible task of killing the man he had once loved like a son.Obi-Wan ignited his lightsaber and slowly made his way down the slope towards Vader. The sound of his footsteps echoed in the silence, each one a heavy weight on his heart.As he approached, Vader struggled to rise, his mechanical limbs whirring and clicking. ""You underestimate my power,"" he rasped, his voice strained.Obi-Wan didn't respond. He knew that this fight was already over, that there was no hope left for his former apprentice. He raised his lightsaber, ready to strike the final blow.But as he looked into Vader's glowing eyes, he saw something that gave him pause. He saw the pain and anguish that Vader was feeling, the regret and sorrow for all that he had lost. And in that moment, Obi-Wan knew that he couldn't do it. He couldn't kill his former apprentice, not when he saw the humanity still left in him.Instead, Obi-Wan deactivated his lightsaber and stepped back. ""I can't do it, Anakin,"" he said softly. ""I can't kill you.""Vader looked up at him, his eyes filled with confusion and despair. ""Then what will you do?"" he asked.Obi-Wan shook his head. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""But I can't let you continue down this path of darkness. You have to stop, Anakin. You have to find a way back to the light.""Vader struggled to his feet, his breath ragged. ""It's too late for me,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. ""I'm too far gone.""Obi-Wan reached out a hand, wanting to comfort his former apprentice, but he knew that it was too late. Vader stumbled backwards, his body wracked with pain and sorrow.And then, with a final anguished cry, Vader fell backwards into the lava pit. Obi-Wan watched in horror as the flames consumed his former apprentice, tears streaming down his face.He had failed Anakin again, had failed to save him from the darkness. And as he stood there, alone in the silence, Obi-Wan knew that he would carry that failure with him for the rest of his life.",1
"“Come on, you promised.” Jisoo whined as tugged on Jeonghan’s hand. “I won’t be able to talk to Minnie after if you’re not there.”“Ugh fine.” Jeonghan rolled his eyes as Jisoo cheered.“I don’t understand why you don’t bring Seungkwan to these things.” Jeonghan says as they walked to the court. “Doesn’t he have a crush on that one guy?”“Yes and that crush is exactly why he’s not coming.” Jisoo replies as they sit down. “He’s always shouting every time the guy shoots the ball. Attracts too much attention.”Jeonghan looks around and notices they aren’t the only ones watching but everyone was focused on the players so he doesn’t think anyone would mind if he watches a show on his phone.He was brought out of his thoughts when he hears a shout.“Watch out!” Jeonghan’s eyes widen as he sees the captain lose his balance from getting hit by his teammate, and both him and the ball are going to crash into him.Jeonghan closes his eyes as he feels the bench fall back, bracing for impact. He opens his eyes as he feels a strong arm catch him, pulling him up even as the bench clatters to the floor.He finds himself face to face with Choi Seungcheol, the other man above him, bracing himself with his left hand while the other cradled Jeonghan.“Are you okay?” Seungcheol asks, sighing in relief as Jeonghan nods. He stood up, brining Jeonghan to his feet at the same time. He watches Jeonghan brush himself off, before fixing the bench and getting the ball.“I’m really sorry.” Seungcheol says before walking towards his team, who were all standing nervously to the side.“50 laps!” They started running even before Seungcheol finished what he was saying.“Are you sure you’re alright?” Jisoo asks as he sits beside Jeonghan, watching the other watch Seungcheol. “I think you hit your head because you’re staring right now.”Jeonghan fights down a blush before waving Jisoo closer. “I think he hurt his hand earlier.”“Oh please you just want to ogle at him.” He replies before turning to watch Seungcheol as well. They both saw him wince and shake off his hand before pressing a towel onto it.“I’ll go tell someone.” Jeonghan stands up and walks towards the coach, who was watching from the side.“Hey kid, you good? Want me to have them run more laps?”Jeonghan laughs as he shakes his head. “Oh no, but I was actually wondering if you can call the captain? I think he hurt his hand from earlier.”They both watch as Seungcheol removes the towel, a bit of red showing.“Choi! Come here.” As Seungcheol runs towards them, the coach adds, “Follow Mr. Yoon to the clinic.”With wide eyes, Seungcheol looked like he was about to protest. Whatever he had to say died in his throat as his coach just pointed to the door.-“Ow.”Jeonghan laughed as he watched Seungcheol turn away from his wound, wincing every now and again even though Jeonghan hadn’t done anything yet.“Oh hush, I haven’t even started.”As Jeonghan gently cleaned his wounds, Seungcheol couldn’t help but stare. Blond wisps framing his face, the look of concentration in his eyes. Seungcheol had never seen someone quite as beautiful.“Done.” Jeonghan says, shaking him from his thoughts as he sealed the end of the bandage. “Make sure to clean it every day with mild soap and water to prevent infections.”Jeonghan places a roll of bandages in his other hand for him to take home, along with a lollipop.“For being a good patient.” Jeonghan says with a wink.Seungcheol laughs, before unwrapping and putting it in his mouth. When he doesn’t do anything else, Jeonghan turns around and faces him again.“Need anything else?”Seungcheol pouts, “You didn’t kiss it better.” He jokingly says, wondering where he got to guts to say such a thing.When Jeonghan doesn’t immediately respond, he waves his wounded hand with an awkward laugh.“I was just joking-“ he cute himself off when Jeonghan grabs his hand.“There.” Jeonghan says as he places a soft kiss above the bandages. “Better?”“Ye-yeah.” Seungcheol winces as his voice squeaks a little. He clears his throat. “Yes, much better.”If Seungcheol had anything else to say, Jeonghan wasn’t able to hear it as the doors to the clinic open and the rest of the basketball team shuffled in. Apologizing to Jeonghan while joking with Seungcheol.‘Next time.’ Seungcheol thought to himself as he watched Jeonghan smile and joke with his friends, ‘Next time I’ll ask you out.’",1
"Harry was scared. He wanted to come out to Sirius but he doesn’t know how he will react. You see Harry is pansexual. And he has accepted this fact since he was thirteen he’s now fifteen and in the Order of the Phoenix HQ and pacing back and forth. He knew that Sirius wasn’t homophobic, in fact, no one in the HQ is. Ron is trans and his older brother Charlie is Aroace. And Nymphadora is non-binary. But he’s the chosen one. If he were to let people know that he was and then he would be ridiculed. 
 
Harry Potter is not allowed to come out but he is. Plus he’s meant to be a Gryffindor, for Merlins' sake! Voldermort scares him less than coming out. Harry builds up his confidence and marched downstairs.
 
He found Sirius and Remus in the kitchen talking over some freshly brewed tea. “Oh Harry, lad, how are you?” Sirius asked, smiling at him.
 
“Uh… I’m good… I have something to tell you, both,” he said fidgeting with his jumper sleeve. He awkwardly sat down in the chair across from him. Both of them were waiting patiently for him to speak. 
 
Harry took a deep breath before speaking. “I’m Pansexual.”
 
“Holy shit!” Sirius yells. Remus cups his hand over Sirius’ mouth.
 
“What?” Harry whispered under his breath. Remus heard what he said and elaborated.
 
“Harry your father was Pansexual. Same with your grandfather, Fleamont, and your great-grandfather Henry. And the goes same for his father. In fact, we would have been more surprised if you ended up being straight.”
 
“I– all of them?”
 
“As far as we can tell,” Sirius said.
 
“Plus we were the first people James came out to. In fact, he dated Sirius’ younger brother,” Remus said nudging Sirius in the side with a small smirk.
 
“WHAT?!” yelled Harry. Most definitely alerting the whole house.
 
“Yeah buddy there’s a lot to catch up on,” Sirius said.",1

He’s had a few names. Sans, Brother, Old Friend, Dust, Death, MONSTER…Some of those names had aged on him; he was no longer Sans since he lost himself and he was not anyone’s Brother after he killed Papyrus for the last time. There’s a place and a time for other names- names that bring out something powerful and greedy in him but he’s been good at limiting those names from being spoken. Considering he’s damned near invisible to the rest of the gaggle of skeletons he’s say he’s done a good job. When the newcomer knocks on the door he’s just conveniently in the kitchen waiting on the beep of the coffee maker and picking at a plate of lasagna. Two knocks in and he already heard Blue shotgunning to the door. He didn’t care to pay attention until he noticed the voice didn't sound familiar and he peered over the corner for a peep. He thought it would be the house’s lover, Babi, or even the certain pair of skeletons who were allowed to do their secret jobs and come at any weird hour of the day. Instead there was a beaming human turned sideways to shake the rain off her frog themed umbrella while happily chatting with Blue and classic Sans. Her fashion sense definitely didn't… match her age, loose green (frog??) short sleeve hoodie and baggy brown long sleeve shirt that covered the arms where the hoodie couldn't. A light skirt reached just above her knees, and cutesy rain boots shucked and kicked gently to the side. There even looked to be some pins in her hair but he was too far to be able to tell what they were.Words flowed past him, like a ball floating above a current of air that wont let it touch the ground. Even if he wanted to know what they were saying, her voice, he was so entirely distracted by his hazy idea of this person he couldn't stop staring at the way the pads of her fingers fiddled with the bright bandaids on his knuckles. Something snapped in him, and he reeled back into reality. It was the feeling of eyes on him and the white noise he didn’t realize before was abruptly gone, yet the silence was so loud. The frog girl stands in his vision with a gentle expression and a tilt that brings her closer to his height. It’s such a subtle act, it makes his SOUL feel like fire.”Hi,” she laughed with a hint of coyness and in the same breath she mentions her name. Her name rang inside his skull. Her name. Her name. Save it. She still stood in front of him, hand between him and her, a little too low to be confident, but in one second her smile had a new quirk to it. Shy fangs peeked from her soft lips. “I don’t mean to make you too nervous, I thought we should properly meet before I took too long and ruined my first impression.”  He took her warm- warm hand and internally shuddered at the contact. “It’s nice to meet you Dust, I hope we get to be good friends while I’m here.”",1
"""You and Tavros are pretty close, especially considering your respective caste systems and...other noticeable differences. Have you considered dating him?""I get asked this a lot...and what's weird is that it's usually about me and Tavros and not about any of my other fronds. I guess it's because I hang out with him the most outside of my morrail? Do we look that good together? Compatible aspects? Who knows?The point is I do love Tavros, probably more than I loved my last actual boyfrond but...I don't reelly have any desire to go out with him. Not now and probably not in the future.Why? Pretty invasive but okay: I think Tavros is tough, tougher than most people give him credit for. The thing is, tough or not, he's pretty passive when it comes to his relationships. It's never even a matter of putting his foot down on a subject, it's a matter of him letting others walk over him in a sort of preventive measure against conflict. I don't mind being friends with someone like that as long as they have compassion, which Tavros has plenty of, but when I get a partner, I need someone I can view as an equal. That means someone who can challenge me and actually stand against me when I bring up a contentious point. Tavros and I are close enough that we can argue about minor stuff but I think he folds too quickly for the major stuff and I think being in a romantic relationship would worsen that dynamic, not help it. Make no mistake, Tavros is one of the most important people in my life...but I want to make sure he stays that bay without destroying our whole teamwork with ""kissing stuff"", as the academics put it.Plus, I already kiss him so just officiating it would make it complicated.I would totally have made him my morrail but that position is taken. Otherwise, my main non-romantic squeeze is Tavros and that's the bay it will stay!",1

The Night It All StartedIt was already midnight. Ophelia had lost count of herself recalling the Wizarding World. It had been years since the last time she saw it before she moved to London to live with her uncle and aunt. She missed her old neighborhood. She missed her older brother too. She was supposed to receive the Hogwarts admission letter – just like her brother – four years ago, but it never came. She felt miserable and considered herself a squib.

"He did it. Izuku won. He won, he thought as he dropped to the ground. Izuku was covered in bloody mud, while most blood was his, he also had AFO and Shigaraki's blood on him. He killed them, he'll forever feel horrible for killing Shigaraki. He felt dizzy, loosing a decent amount of blood; but the only thing on his mind as he's laying on the ground is that Katsuki needs him. So, despite his injuries he struggles, but gets up and travels as far as it takes to get there; his legs felt numb by the time he made it there. Tears rolling down his face out of happiness, but aslo worry.Dropping to his knees, he brings Bakugou Into his arms and checks for a pulse. He can hardly feel it, and he's weakly breathing; but what if it was just Izuku hallucinating?? Izuku is sobbing over him, with hope in his heart. Whispering ""we did it"" ""we won"" ""we'll be okay"" as able heroes and paramedics finally get too the scene, Izuku couldn't hear Bakugou's breathing anymore, it made him panic and freak out. More tears falling down his face as he hurriedly helped Bakugou get too help.When they tried separating him from the other to deal with Izuku's wounds; you could hear his hysterical screams of pleas and Bakugou's name. He was scared. Terrified that if his sight left the other the next time he'd see him would be at Katsuki's funeral. Everything around him became too much as the people around him constantly moved and worked and there were flashing lights now as he could tell, his breath was rapid and his ears were ringing, partially due to the blood loss he had experienced. His chest hurt so much emotionally. His shoulders felt so heavy, the guilt stabbing into him. What if it was too late. What if he's dead. It'd be all his fault. He should have been quicker. He couldn't see anything through the tears spilling down his face as he curled into himself, he couldn't tell where he was now, there were Only murmurs around him. How could he let this happen? He thought. Until he felt something cup over his mouth like a mask and he fell right too sleep.Bakugou on the other hand, /was/ alive. They restarted his heart with a paramedic's quirk, he had sat up in gasping breaths, he was shoved back down so his injuries wouldn't get worse. His ears were ringing, the right side of his face hurt. His chest too, everything ached and stung. He couldn't see anything out of his right eye, a mix of black and red in it. His right ear hurt like hell and was ringing way louder but he could hear screaming over the ringing. It was heart wretching screams, the kind he never wanted to hear out of Izuku. Izuku? It was /Izuku/?? He tried to make out what he was screaming, and he heard his name faintly; and not his nickname, his first name. Was Izuku okay, where is Katsuki anyways?? Bakugou tried shoving himself back up but someone held him down which only caused panic in his head, he needed an out. He tried to explode whatever was holding him down but yelped when the pain in his hands flared up. His breathing was already uneven, but with how disoriented he was, he had started hyperventilating, trying to take in deep gasps of air to calm down; but he couldn't think rationally anymore. What if Shigaraki had gotten ahold of him, was the war over? What about the others?? He was about to blast whatever put something over his mouth but he took a deep breath and near instantly blacked out.",1
"Upbeat music drowned out the panicked cries and screams of the crowd desperately trying to reach the exit, people stepping over others just so they could get out alive. In the middle stood a woman, bathing in crimson splatters and entrails.""You completely blew our cover, miss Ryoushuu.""The lady in white spoke in a dissatisfied tone, sighing as her words trailed off. The artist draws out a stick of tobacco from one of her pockets and a lighter in the other, lighting herself a nice, old fashioned cigarette.""Sure, SPG. I did.""The artist laughed, looking up at the ceiling as the smoke from her cigarette reached the fire sprinkler above, inevitably spraying water to put out the non-existent fire in the room.""I don't think I'd like to know what that means.""""Tsk- Gah, fucking piece of shit… there goes my cigs.""The artist swore vehemently as if it was the fire sprinkler's fault. Even though she could just take out another one and light it up outside the room, it'll probably end up being snatched away by Faust anyway.""...Lets go, miss Ryoushuu. The bus awaits us.""Faust turned towards the door to leave before realizing that Ryoushuu didn't follow her at all, then she turned around to see what she's doing. Ruminating? Awestruck by the pile of corpses she left in the wake of her massacre?The hype and lively music slowly began to deteriorate, stuttering as the electronics died out from the water. It didn't sound pleasant, frankly. It was like scratching a fork over a porcelain plate, though it didn't take long for the music to finally be put to rest.""... Let's just go.""Before Faust could leave, she felt a tug at her arm. Ryoushuu wasn't letting her leave. While yes, she could just shake off the woman's grip and go on, she didn't feel like it. Something pulls Faust back to her, like a magnetic force forcing the two together.""What?""""Care for a dance before we leave?""""R-Ridiculous. Faust doesn't have time for such a trivial thing.""""Worry about it later.""And so, Ryoushuu glides her feet backwards and pulls Faust right into her, the latter falling into her chest as the former slipped her hand on the latter's waist.""Don't get handsy.""The artist started slow so the so-called genius could follow her steps, starting with a step to the right followed by the other foot stepping forward, creating a steady circular motion between the two dancers.A slow but romantic waltz. Its a little quiet though, don't you think?""I find it too quiet, miss Ryoushuu.""Right, the music got busted by the water (and thank goodness the sprinkler is done spewing out water), so they'll have to improvise with the music using something else. Ryoushuu, being the lady-killer she is, decides to play a trick up her sleeve.The artist closed in on Faust's smooth, pearly skin, her cheek grazing the artist's. Ryoushuu's lips were about as close as it could get to her cheek, and then she started humming to her ear.An acapella. Faust didn't even realize how beautiful her voice sounded, as the only things she would often hear from her are trivial acronyms and whatever else she decides to say. But oh, make no mistake, she sounds angelic. Whether it's her natural voice or her trying to sound pleasant, it's undeniable that it's beautiful.She's like a lullaby.Faust loosened herself up, allowing the tension to ease and her shoulders to relax, only minding the steps Ryoushuu takes next and when she should follow. Soon enough, she found herself leaning into Ryoushuu, embracing her.The artist snuck a smooch onto her cheek, making Faust even more flustered. But of course, being the person she is, she didn't say anything and insisted on keeping her smartassy poker-face on.Ryoushuu parted from their dear embrace, then trailed her index up to Faust's chin, tilting her head to face her.Their faces inch closer and closer, leaning in for a–""Ryo, Faust~ Verg is fumi–""Rodion appeared at the door, interrupting the scene they were having and breaking the immersion completely. Suddenly, Faust broke away from Ryoushuu's grasp and bolted towards the door, trying to mask as much embarrassment showing on her face as she could.""You could've knocked before entering, Rodya.""""Sorry to interrupt your little moment~ But I'd rather not get killed by Vergie.""Well, whatever.Maybe next time.",1
"Chapter Text

Ten people woke up, all alone in one room, a big cafeteria, it seemed. They exchanged looks, yet no words were spoken. Silence hung in the air as though the death of a loved one was just announced. 
A girl in a red suit yelled ""Where the hell am I?!""To which a white-suited person responded with ""shh! Don't yell, it won't get us anywhere. Who are all of you?""""Are names really necessary? No!"" Black barked.White shushed her as well. ""Please, let's just calm down. We don't know where we are or how we got here, let's take a minute to gather all the info we can, then make a plan,""Purple sighed. ""What am I supposed to call all of you? Idiot one, two, three, four, fi-""""Let's call each other by our suit colors for now,"" said Orange.  ""If anyone would like to share your name, do so after we discuss, please. It would make everything much easier,”
White 
""Thank you!"" Everyone looked at them expectantly. ""What..? I'm not talking, y'all share your information, I don't share mine!"" 
Pink
""I don't remember anything""
Red
""of course you don't! We've woken up in some ship, in the middle of space, and you can't remember one single thing! You're no help!"" Blue stood and grabbed Pink, dragging them both out of the room. 
Cyan
""That was really rude Red,” 
Lime
""I agree, we have to work together if we want to get out, that wasn't wor-""
A voice rang from above, like an intercom of some sort. Welcome to spaceship H3AT20, better known as The Skeld. You ten were chosen by no mistake, each of you passed your tests and proved worthy of this great opportunity. Do not take this with a grain of salt. This is something you may never have the chance to experience again. You can find tablets on the top right table of the cafeteria, they will show you your tasks along with a map. Tomorrow there will be two Imposters among you, do not be quick to trust. Crewmates, you have three jobs: fix sabotages, complete tasks, and most importantly, don't get killed.

Imposters, you have four jobs: sabotage, fake tasks, kill and Spread
Goodluck. 
Everyone scattered to the top right table for their tablet.
 
Green
""does...anyone else have a warning sign on their tablet?""
Orange
""I do.""
Pink
""yup!"" 
Purple
""sadly...yes, although I hate to be down here with yo-"" 
White
""Purple, please, be quiet. It's a yes or no question, you don't ne-"" 
Purple
""Don't interrupt me! As I was saying..."" 
She rambled on about how she was better than everyone else.
 
Pink
""everyone has warning signs, I checked.""
Suddenly a loud alarm went off and the words Reactor Meltdown came on screen.

 

Lime
""Reactor..?"" 
Pink
""It's where the nuclear fission is stored, and controlled,""
Everyone looked at her, confused.
""I...like space?"" Blue""Okay, well let's fix it,"" He stood and everyone followed him to what they assumed was the reactor. 
 Blue and Cyan placed their hands on the scanners and the alarm shut off. Everyone glanced at their

tablets where a list of tasks was now displayed.",1
"He never dies because so many people love him. Although they rarely realized it and made him realize it. Everything about him was an unshakable part of life. People were used to catching his name in conversation, the tip of the tongue clicking on the teeth, jumping up like a spring, hanging in the air and then dropping down, just like sending a piece of raw fish into their mouth. And those four syllables—occasionally with an addition—were just delivered briskly and fluently by their vocal cords. But the name seldom stayed long, and seldom carried emotions stronger than a dish of saury sashimi. Certainly, the speaker would not agree that it was because they did not love him, but one fact had already been proved long ago: whenever you turned around, looked away, left and returned, he was always there. Yet they didn't believe that he was special, nor did they believe that all the miracles he'd performed were due to his genius. He just did something, lived, came in and out of a certain corner of the world, and built bonds with others by chance. But for no reason at all he became 
stable
, and when they thought of the word they felt like they were describing a bridge. Wind and rain hit its pillars. Haste, loss, not good enough choices, regrets of not being able to fulfill too many wishes. But the bridge wouldn't break. Oh, it wouldn't, it wouldn't. It would NOT. How could you picture him dying? He always said, okay. 
Okay
. He raised his chopsticks and gave up two slices of barbecued pork, the honey-colored meat dripping a little translucent sauce while being picked up by 
someone
. He held the winds above the handlebars of his rocking bicycle to girls who couldn't reach the back seat, for they were just starting to grow at that time. 
You sure you don't want to change that antique cellphone?
 They asked him, but they didn't insist, for everyone could recall some gentle memories when the cheerful taiko drumming rained upon the air. He was an ordinary guy, of course. The headaches and fevers he'd gotten were no less than anyone else's, maybe even more. They complained that he was a regular visitor of the room with a white ceiling and faint smell of disinfectant, and even he himself was puzzled by the frequency of bad luck. It didn't matter, though. It would not shake the theory of life and death 
inside
 him. When there were enough incidents to draw a general rule, they found that he never bled. Literally. It was quite natural to reach this conclusion, for a fruit knife had never cut his hand, and never had a bullet involving someone in a conspiracy hit his shoulder as well. Undoubtedly, the dark red liquid flowing under the skin is the medium of life, and you'd see a candle extinguish forever if it drained away. Now everyone was relieved. See, his blood stayed safely in the vessels, then through the muscles and bones, to the surface, conveying reassuring warmth. Just as he always said, it's all right. 
It's all right
. He never dies because he loves so many people. So now they walked to the entrance of the hospital together, quietly watching the white light floating in the corridor slowly recede behind, and met a young nurse, with a bouquet of vibrant golden flowers in her arms. She whispered softly to everyone coming towards her, it was for a child, she said. He was hospitalized here many years ago with a mild cold. We chatted about everything, from childish trio games to future dreams. And on the day he was discharged, he gave me a bouquet of flowers, yes, a bouquet like this. I still don't know how he got it. The moment I took those flowers, well, he closed his eyes as if feeling sleepy, and then, was just gone.",1
"Akkarin let go of Lorlen's whiskey again, closing his eyes.

Today he was closer than ever to the mind of Lorlen - even managed to get through the locked door and see him. And from what he saw to lose concentration - in front of him stood Lorlen, as he saw him in their first meeting at the Ceremony. A skinny teenager who happily responded and even tried to grab Akkarin's arm. For a second there was a feeling of thin cold fingers, and then it was gone - Akkarin was again thrown out of Lorlen's consciousness.

Cursing, Akkarin wearily touched Lorlen's arm, causing him to look up blankly. Absolute emptiness and detachment - that's what Akkarin constantly got instead of burning eyes. I so wanted to break this door, but it was impossible - the consciousness, gradually recovering, simply could not withstand such destruction. Then Lorlene won't survive at all and everything will be...

""Don't think about it,"" Akkarin ordered himself. ""Consciousness will be restored and Lorlen will not die.""

Gently touching Lorlen's lips, Akkarin wearily pressed the man to him, stroking his gray head and sending soothing healing energy into Lorlen's body. Then he slowly ran his hand along his back, feeling the wild ripples of scars that crossed the Administrator's entire back. Unfortunately, treatment is unlikely to help - time is lost - but Akkarin was even glad that Lorlen was alive anyway. As crazy as it may sound sometimes.
Akkarin's neck was touched by someone's lips. Laughing softly, Akkarin grabbed Lorlen by the shoulders.- Is there something wrong? - Lorlen raised her head.- No, it's all right, - Akkarin smiled, touching such a beloved and dear face. But he could have lost all this then two years ago. But no...-The feeling of unreality? - Lorlen smiled. The eyes were shining.- Lorlen... - Akkarin began, but was interrupted when Lorlen softly touched his lips.Shaking off all doubts, Akkarin grabbed Lorlen by the arms, turning over so that he was on top. Lorlen laughed, tilting his head.Akkarin smiled - he probably felt that way himself, but Lorlen's face at that moment was a very beautiful sight. A little drunk, but happy expression. The kisses they gave each other. It is beautiful and intoxicates no worse than Dark Anurensky. Beautiful, hot exciting. Watch, enjoy and notice every change in the bright blue eyes, in the soft smile...What he loved and what he does not want to lose - everything is concentrated in one person.And so it will always be.",1
"My heart beats in my chest.
It is loud and it is quiet.
It is rhythmic and it is erratic.
It is pulsing and it is still.
My heart is mine
and it beats for me alone. My lover tells me his heart beats my name.
He is warm and he is solid and he is alive.
He lays my hand on his chest
and I hear thud thud-thud thud.
I do not hear my name. My heart does not beat his name.
Or if it does I do not hear it.
I do not tell him this, because I love him
But my heart is mine
And it beats for me alone. I love my children.
I love them with all my soul.
But I do not love them with my heart
For it does not beat their names
Because my heart is mine
And it beats for me alone. I give all my strength to the land.
I give all I own to my king.
I give all my faith to The Lord.
But my my heart is mine
And I give it to no one
For it beats for me alone.",1
"Chapter Text
Hello there, I am Gabriel. You know, the Red Stinger/Human Hybrid that wears a Penguin Suit. And not to be confused with my Bonneter Buddy of practically the same name named Gabe. Because Gabe is a shorter term for Gabriel. And that means that we practically have the same name. But for less confusion, we sometimes go by our species' names. Bonneter & Penguin Red Stinger. The full is Penguin Red Stinger/Human but the thing is that in the process of my hybridization, I ended up looking more of a Red Stinger than my original human self.But anyways, enough about introducing myself to you guys & gals. You might've been thinking that I've always been like this my whole life that my parents were a Red Stinger & a Human or they are both Red Stingers(Yes, female Red Stingers do exist out there).But, what if I told you that this isn't what I always used to look like. What do you mean by that you ask? Well, to make it simple, I wasn't always a hybrid between a Plant & Human which in other words means that my parents were both indeed Human. And if you're wondering when my life changed for a very big reason, I'll gladly tell you the backstory of me.So buckle in and get the snacks if you'll be wanting to know my origin story in deeper detail. And I know a place to collect and check these memories.And also, I'm still practically new to this whole Book-writing schtick. So I am sorry if the first couple of chapters of my origin/backstory are badly/not well written.",1
"The smell of summer fills the room as Gerard pushes the window up. He walks back over to the bed, barely making a sound. It's pleasantly quiet in the brothers' shared room with the two of them sitting on the bottom bunk of bunkbed.Mikey is supposed to have the top bunk. And though he did climb up there on occasion, most of the time he never makes it up before drifting to sleep in his brother's arms on the bottom bunk. He secretly prefers it that way, though, and he's certain Gerard does too.Somewhere down the line, it got darker, and the two of them ended up tangled together on the floor, arms wrapped around each other. He hasn't quite reached puberty yet, so he fits in his older brother's arms perfectly. The sticky feeling of Gerard's sweaty skin should be unpleasant, but it isn't. It makes Mikey feel safe. He wouldn't want this any other way.Gerard's breath is warm on his forehead. One of his hands are tangled in Mikey's hair, gently twirling strands in his fingers. His nails are rough on Mikey's scalp, but not rough enough to cause pain.Despite every action being unspoken, both of them are aware of the feelings associated with them. They both long for each other in a way beyond brotherly love. And they both know it.Mikey's heart flutters when Gerard moves his hand from his hair to his lower jaw and plants a kiss on his lips. Mikey moves a hand up and places it on the back of Gerard's neck, his other hand moving to the small of his back. They place their foreheads together, their sweat interlocking and falling to the floor.For the first time, Mikey found comfort in dark silence.He wishes there was a way the two of them could properly express their feelings somewhere that isn't behind closed doors for once. They aren't young anymore, not young enough for it all to be thrown to the side as kids being kids.If there was a way he could go back, a way he could change everything, he would. He would do anything for his older brother.Mikey's head slightly moves up when he hears his name whispered into his ear softly. Though what Gerard says next seems like nonsense muttering, Mikey understands it perfectly, and replies with an ""I love you too, Gee.""",1
"“No.”The dust settled around him as Frank crawled out from under the table and cabinets that had saved his life. And for what? His ears were ringing and the world moved slowly as Frank looked around himself at the destroyed remains of the greenroom.His breathing picked up when he saw red, a quickly growing pool of red, seeping out from under a large piece of the roof that had collapsed. Faintly Frank registered that his chest was hurting, but all he could see was the red, way too much of it, right where Mikey and Ray had been sitting.Frank coughed and collapsed on the floor. He became aware of how much he was shaking and stared at his fingers as they trembled before him. He couldn’t feel anything. It felt like he was standing on the edge of a storm, aware it was happening, but not yet able to perceive the effects.“No,” Frank whimpered, the word escaping his throat in an emotion he was not aware of. Tears were dripping down his face as Frank moved through the rubble, hoisting himself upright and shuddering at the red that now covered his jeans. He stumbled to where Gerard had been, in front of the mirror to adjust his costume, the business woman again. She was supposed to have died today.Frank heaved, his stomach rolled at the fucking irony of it all. Gerard had to have survived. Gerard would. Of course Gerard would. He would. They would. He wou-Everything went dim except for what was in front of Frank. There, between his feet, was Gerard’s decapitated, lifeless, face.The make-up was indistinguishable from the real injuries and blood. Frank thought faintly that Gerard was such an amazing artist, before the reality set in and he opened his mouth and screamed. He didn’t know how long he screamed. He dropped to his knees and couldn’t close his mouth. In a fit of madness he held Gerard’s face between his hands before curling in on himself and screaming, constant, gut-wrenching howls of terror.He was found by a pair of firemen, who had to force him from the wreckage. He was forced in an ambulance and tended to. Frank was barely cognisant of what was happening. His gaze kept moving back to the crumbled remains of the venue. There were so many injured people being tended to, Frank didn’t dare think about the amount of people who hadn’t made it out alive.He was deemed in good state and guided to a police officer. The officer was talking to him and Frank responded, but the conversation didn’t register. All he could see was the blood and the empty look in Gerard’s eyes. His eyes drifted down to the officer’s gun holster as the officer wrote in a notebook.The gun was right within reach. It wouldn’t be hard to grab. How easy would it be, just to take that gun? Frank released a deep breath and then everything went black.The sound of a gun being fired echoed through the night.",1
"Fabian has been locked in a literal cage in Dumbledore’s office for a month.Dumbledore captured him, and used him as leverage against the Prewetts, Gideon putting his hand up to do anything the old man requested of him.It was only supposed to be for the month, and then Dumbledore had promised to let them go.Gideon has done everything that that Dumbledore fucker has asked of him, and yet his brother is fading away to nothing before his eyes. Each day, he gets closer and closer to accepting the reality that he’s not making it out alive and Gideon won’t stand for it.One day, around week six, he turns to Dumbledore and says,“I don’t know what else you want from me, I’ve given months of my life to your cause, I’m wanted in several counties for crimes I’ve committed for you. Can’t you finally let my brother go?”Dumbledore refuses him, insisting as he does during their meeting that Gideon dine with him in return for a visit with his brother, said starving brother watching on. Gideon is filled with guilt as he gets fatter and Fabian withers away, as if the weight is coming off of one and going to the other.On this same day, Gideon politely compliments the meal. Dumbledore is more agreeable when he is on his best behaviour, and his earlier outburst did not win him any points.“Ah yes, it’s an old family recipe.” Dumbledor accepts his compliments. “Do you know, the meat I tend to prefer is quite tough on its own. I have a special fat that I use in these stews that make it quite a meal. It’s quite good, no?”Gideon agrees. He asks for leftovers. There’s something weird about this stew.During his next mission for Dumbledore, Gideon drops off the stew to a chemist and asks him to test its components.He is horrified to find that it contains meat and fats from humans. That’s right, not just one, but several humans.And he’s been eating it for weeks.Gideon promptly vomits into the nearest bush, and in his spare time over the coming days, finally comes clean to his township about the hold this man has over him by holding his brother hostage. He creates such a discourse in the community, that there’s a witch hunt.They lay in wait, until the door is unlocked and Dumbledore admits Gideon to his home, his walls well and truly down with the gained trust in him, before they storm his castle and take him down.As with all witch hunts, it ends in a bonfire, the man being tied to the main support beam of the cottage, numerous flammable objects surrounding him. As they set the belongings on fire, the flame licking up the fuel soaked woods and flammable materials, the old man's screams ring out through the house.As he died for the suffering he caused, Fabian and Gideon were reunited at last, as twins ought to be.As they basked in the warmth of the flames on the cold winter night, Fabian ate the remaining stewed leftovers, a taste for human flesh. They made a pact to only ever source it ethically.",1
"At a large, stone pathway in Limgrave- not too far from Agheel Lake, A Ring-tailed lemur, dressed in a set of muddy, common bandit attire, dotted with blood, was dashing down the dirty, slightly cracked pathway- Throwing herself forward with her tail- which had a large chunk of fur missing, afflicted by the accursed scarlet rot,- visibly nervous as she had a great knife in her grasp, but 6 Godrick soldiers following her. ""FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK- FUCK!"" yelled the lemur at the top of her lungs, sweat dripping down her forehead, her throat feeling hoarse and injured, thanks to the scarlet rot that had been planning her demise since youth. As she ran, she desperately scavenged for an idea- And then, as what felt like a light bulb suddenly igniting, she thought of something- Gritting her teeth, the bandit stopped in her tracks- Turning to the soldiers as she walked near the edge of the pathway- inches away from falling downwards and directly next to Agheel. ""Hey! LOSERS! COME AND GET ME!"" Tangle screamed, waving her arms wildly in the air to gather attention- taunting them. The soldiers were cautious, for a moment- But that moment was ever so brief as they chased after the lemur, who rolled out of the way as she unleashed a barrage of sword-swings and attacks where she once stood, And, very quickly, her once distressed expression became a smug, proud grin as she pushed the soldiers off the path and down towards Agheel with one fell swoop of her tail, almost like a broom brushing away dust. The soldiers were almost immediately grabbed by the dragon, who tore them apart in a bloody, violent scene that Tangle decided to look away from, ""Phew!"" She spoke as she sighed in relief, turning back to the path. After dealing with the soldiers, Tangle set her sights on a small set of ruins, devoid of any danger or even treasure, just up on a nearby hill. Climbing up the hill, Tangle walked into the ruins- well, more akin to onto the ruins, considering the complete lack of a roof, the ruins essentially being a stone flooring with broken walls. She carefully stepped over the beetles that swarmed the ruins, sharply gazing at the floor- Staring at seemingly nothing, the bandit then stomped her foot as hard as she could against a part of the floor, A portion of the floor fading away to reveal a set of stairs, leading underneath the stone ruins and towards a wooden door. ""Jewel? I'm back!"" Tangle said as she walked down the stairway, the illusionary floor reappearing as she entered the 'basement' of the ruins. The wooden door slowly opened,  revealing a beetle dressed in long, blue robes similar to that of robes from Raya Lucaria Academy- sorcerer's robes, to put it simply. She seemed unusually joyful for a sorcerer, smiling as she let Tangle into the room. It was a small study- a stone room with a bookshelf, multiple desks, and glintstones alongside books littered across the floor. There was a pile of notes sitting next to a bottle of ink, a feather, plus a map of Limgrave. ""Hi, Tangle."" The beetle spoke as Tangle entered, quickly turning away from her and walking over to the scattered note piles- Jewel didn't even seem to notice Tangle's multiple scratches and bruises, too focused on her work to even turn her head. ""Hey, Jewel."" Tangle muttered as she yawned, stretching her arms in the air before leaning against a wall, slowly sliding down onto the floor. Jewel snatched a glintstone, rotating it in her hands as she looked at her notes. ""Tangle, can you-"" Jewel went to ask, going to ask Tangle for help before swiftly noticing her many, many wounds. Jewel was shocked, and clearly concerned- Tangle noticed this, and became slightly nervous. ""Oh my go- Are you okay? Has the scarlet rot been getting worse? Why didn't you tell me about this?"" Jewel continued, rushing over to Tangle and examining the scarlet rot covering her tail. Tangle took a deep breath, before sighing, giving her reply, ""Yeah- No- not really. I got into some trouble with some Godrick soldiers out there, made it out, I just got a couple scratches. The rot's been...progressing, as usual. You- You've gotten close to getting some more medicine though, right?"" She said, becoming sadder as she hoped Jewel had finally gotten the ingredients- Jewel looked like she was beginning to go on the verge of tears, grit her teeth and turned away; ""I...No. I'm so sorry- I just...need a few more days. I won't take too long, I swear."" Tangle knew Jewel wouldn't lie to her- They were friends for so long, But those words were cutting- painful to hear, Tangle flinched as Jewel spoke. But something did catch her eye, as she tried to distract herself from the conversation- A green, shining light, that was never there before, hidden underneath a pile of books. It felt like pure chaos, forced into an object. And Tangle would be sure to investigate it.",1

There’s something weird about this stew.During his next mission for Dumbledore, Gideon drops off the stew to a chemist and asks him to test its components.He is horrified to find that it contains meat and fats from humans. That’s right, not just one, but several humans.And he’s been eating it for weeks.Gideon promptly vomits into the nearest bush, and in his spare time over the coming days, finally comes clean to his township about the hold this man has over him by holding his brother hostage. He creates such a discourse in the community, that there’s a witch hunt.They lay in wait, until the door is unlocked and Dumbledore admits Gideon to his home, his walls well and truly down with the gained trust in him, before they storm his castle and take him down.As with all witch hunts, it ends in a bonfire, the man being tied to the main support beam of the cottage, numerous flammable objects surrounding him. As they set the belongings on fire, the flame licking up the fuel soaked woods and flammable materials, the old man's screams ring out through the house.As he died for the suffering he caused, Fabian and Gideon were reunited at last, as twins ought to be.As they basked in the warmth of the flames on the cold winter night, Fabian ate the remaining stewed leftovers, a taste for human flesh. They made a pact to only ever source it ethically.",1
"At a large, stone pathway in Limgrave- not too far from Agheel Lake, A Ring-tailed lemur, dressed in a set of muddy, common bandit attire, dotted with blood, was dashing down the dirty, slightly cracked pathway- Throwing herself forward with her tail- which had a large chunk of fur missing, afflicted by the accursed scarlet rot,- visibly nervous as she had a great knife in her grasp, but 6 Godrick soldiers following her. ""FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK- FUCK!"" yelled the lemur at the top of her lungs, sweat dripping down her forehead, her throat feeling hoarse and injured, thanks to the scarlet rot that had been planning her demise since youth. As she ran, she desperately scavenged for an idea- And then, as what felt like a light bulb suddenly igniting, she thought of something- Gritting her teeth, the bandit stopped in her tracks- Turning to the soldiers as she walked near the edge of the pathway- inches away from falling downwards and directly next to Agheel. ""Hey! LOSERS! COME AND GET ME!"" Tangle screamed, waving her arms wildly in the air to gather attention- taunting them. The soldiers were cautious, for a moment- But that moment was ever so brief as they chased after the lemur, who rolled out of the way as she unleashed a barrage of sword-swings and attacks where she once stood, And, very quickly, her once distressed expression became a smug, proud grin as she pushed the soldiers off the path and down towards Agheel with one fell swoop of her tail, almost like a broom brushing away dust. The soldiers were almost immediately grabbed by the dragon, who tore them apart in a bloody, violent scene that Tangle decided to look away from, ""Phew!"" She spoke as she sighed in relief, turning back to the path. After dealing with the soldiers, Tangle set her sights on a small set of ruins, devoid of any danger or even treasure, just up on a nearby hill. Climbing up the hill, Tangle walked into the ruins- well, more akin to onto the ruins, considering the complete lack of a roof, the ruins essentially being a stone flooring with broken walls. She carefully stepped over the beetles that swarmed the ruins, sharply gazing at the floor- Staring at seemingly nothing, the bandit then stomped her foot as hard as she could against a part of the floor, A portion of the floor fading away to reveal a set of stairs, leading underneath the stone ruins and towards a wooden door. ""Jewel? I'm back!"" Tangle said as she walked down the stairway, the illusionary floor reappearing as she entered the 'basement' of the ruins. The wooden door slowly opened,  revealing a beetle dressed in long, blue robes similar to that of robes from Raya Lucaria Academy- sorcerer's robes, to put it simply. She seemed unusually joyful for a sorcerer, smiling as she let Tangle into the room. It was a small study- a stone room with a bookshelf, multiple desks, and glintstones alongside books littered across the floor. There was a pile of notes sitting next to a bottle of ink, a feather, plus a map of Limgrave. ""Hi, Tangle."" The beetle spoke as Tangle entered, quickly turning away from her and walking over to the scattered note piles- Jewel didn't even seem to notice Tangle's multiple scratches and bruises, too focused on her work to even turn her head. ""Hey, Jewel."" Tangle muttered as she yawned, stretching her arms in the air before leaning against a wall, slowly sliding down onto the floor. Jewel snatched a glintstone, rotating it in her hands as she looked at her notes. ""Tangle, can you-"" Jewel went to ask, going to ask Tangle for help before swiftly noticing her many, many wounds. Jewel was shocked, and clearly concerned- Tangle noticed this, and became slightly nervous. ""Oh my go- Are you okay? Has the scarlet rot been getting worse? Why didn't you tell me about this?"" Jewel continued, rushing over to Tangle and examining the scarlet rot covering her tail. Tangle took a deep breath, before sighing, giving her reply, ""Yeah- No- not really. I got into some trouble with some Godrick soldiers out there, made it out, I just got a couple scratches. The rot's been...progressing, as usual. You- You've gotten close to getting some more medicine though, right?"" She said, becoming sadder as she hoped Jewel had finally gotten the ingredients- Jewel looked like she was beginning to go on the verge of tears, grit her teeth and turned away; ""I...No. I'm so sorry- I just...need a few more days. I won't take too long, I swear."" Tangle knew Jewel wouldn't lie to her- They were friends for so long, But those words were cutting- painful to hear, Tangle flinched as Jewel spoke. But something did catch her eye, as she tried to distract herself from the conversation- A green, shining light, that was never there before, hidden underneath a pile of books. It felt like pure chaos, forced into an object. And Tangle would be sure to investigate it.",1
"""I'm so sad about being bald,"" Caesar sighed, running his hand though his sparse hair in an attempt to hide his receding hairline. ""All the other senators make fun of me for it.""""I think it's attractive on you,"" Y/N replied, placing a comforting hand on his arm. ""They're just jealous of how powerful you are.""""Do you really?"" he asked, perking up slightly.""Yes,"" Y/N replied. ""I think bald men are really sexy, and you especially.""""That's so kind of you, Y/N. I'm really insecure about my baldness, and it makes me feel better to know that you like it.""""I love your baldness. It's your sexiest feature."" Y/N paused. ""Apart from how you wear your toga. That belt really sinches your waist in a flattering way.""""The other senators say that it's too effeminate and make fun of me, saying that I'm wearing a woman's blouse.""""They don't know what they're talking about. I bet you've slept with their wives more than they have anyway.""""Is my reputation really that powerful?""""It is. They say you are every woman's man, and every man's woman.""""I'm not sure how I feel about that.""""I'd take it as a compliment - clearly your sexual prowess is admired by all.""""But I do not want to be every woman's man.""Y/N furrowed her brow. ""What do you mean by that?"" she asked.""I want only to be your man, Y/N."" Caesar said, earnestly. He leaned forward, so that his Roman nose was almost touching her ear. ""I love you, Y/N.""Y/N blushed. ""I love you too, Caesar.""Caesar kissed her cheek, then whispered ""call me Julius"" in her ear.""Kiss me, Julius,"" Y/N said breathlessly. ""Kiss me on the lips.""Caesar obliged. It was the most magical moment of her life.",1

"""MICHAEL, STOP."" A random man screamed.Joel peered round the corner with Ellie at his hip, both of their guns out of their holsters. They carefully weaved over the cordyceps making sure not to step on it. Since they'd just managed to escape the explosion that involved Tess after stepping on cordyceps, it wasn't hard to spot it. Silence dragged with them the entire time. Ellie nor Joel had spoke a word to each other. Tess meant a lot to the both of them-""CARSON, FUCK OFF!!"" Another squeaky-ish voice perked up. Joel sighed and jogged towards the wall, finally spotting them. One of them was almost his height, maybe 5'11. His hair was black and scraggly, curls untamed like he hadn't washed for days. A lot of his visible skin was caked in dirt, dust and more. There was a possible chance he was caught by the explosion. Judging by the third degree burns on his arm, leading up to his bicep, Joel's suspicions was correct.And the other one.. well. He was average height, around 5'8. He had equally untamed hair which was vanilla blonde- Joel couldn't tell because his hair was disgustingly dark due to the dirt and rubble and whatever was caught in there. But for some reason they were both inches away from each other, arms flailing and screaming.Ellie was taking to Joel but he was simply too fixated on the two men stood a few yards away. Finally, the 14 year old stomped a few times and caught Joel's attention. But they also caught the attention of the two arguing men. Whilst Joel's eyes were torn away, the two fled to a hidden spot in the broken building.""What are you doing, Joel?"" Exclaimed Ellie. ""Are you going to kill them, or are you going to eyefuck them all day? Come on, they're right over there-"" Ellie gestured with her hand to the spot the two men were originally in, but no one was there.""Fuck off, Ellie."" Joel said quietly, looking around. His shoulder was right up against the brick, head poking round the side. Ellie threw her tantrum, telling Joel how slow he'd gotten and how every person they come across, he's too slow to act. The last person they came across Ellie had shot in the head because Joel was struggling to even keep up.""Whatever. Just help me track them."" Joel mumbled out.""No need."" A deeper voice spat out. Ellie and Joel looked up in unison and one of the men was standing on the bricks towering above them. ""Right here.""Both Joel and Ellie hit the floor.""Now what do we do, Car-car?"" The one on the floor wiped his gun. He'd just pistol-whipped both Joel and Ellie. Now they had one grown man and a teenage girl knocked out on the floor.Carson leapt down off the bricks and bent his knees so he didn't hurt his ankles, before getting up and grabbing the other by his shirt scruff.""Call me Car-Car again and I'll shoot you right between the eyes, Michael."" Carson shook his head, letting Michael go. Michael brushed his shirt off as the other walked over to Joel and grabbed his arms, placing his wrists behind his back and zip-tying him up. Getting the hint, Michael did the same to Ellie. In which two seconds later, Carson had left and appeared back with two horses.Western style, they lifted Joel up together and hoisted him on the back of the horse.",1

“ i always felt drawn to the house in a way. “

“ like it was calling to me. “

“ trying to make me the sixth missing person. “
 
grimacing, she shook her shoulders forward, shutting her eyes in annoyance at the dust that scattered across the room at that simple movement. it covered everything in this house. even it’s weirdly ominous walls. ( how the hell does dust coat the walls? )
 
“ didn’t know i signed up for ghost hunting.. “
 
floorboards creaked as she took a step forward, her converse pressing down the rotten wood, and nearly breaking through it. she didn’t like that detail, it made her feel uneasy. how old is this house? it has to be older than her. 
 
the house smelled like rot and mold. that’s the first think she noted when she pushed through the poorly boarded up front door. it only took a few shoves before the boards gave through and collapsed into a heap in the living room. yet the further she went, the worse it got. it was followed by an oddly metallic smell as well. like she was trapped in a room with iron walls. 
 
“ HELLO? “ she called, letting out a wheeze like cough as she inhaled dust, quickly covering her mouth.
 
“ ugh. “ she choked out. “ i hate this. “ 
 
uncovering her mouth, she felt inside her bag that rested by her waist, and pulled out her camera. it was heavy in her hands, and the fabric of the small handle like accessory dragged uncomfortably across her wrist. 
 
“ just gotta find some proof of the people, and then i can get out of here. “ she muttered, turning her attention away from the floors and sheet-covered furniture, to the staircase. it’s steps were oddly steep, and the walls surrounding it were narrow. only one person would be able to take the steps at a time, which confused her, as this was apparently a ‘ family house. ‘
 
narrowing her eyes at it, she started to it, before pausing.
 
“ odd. i swear i saw something. “ she grumbled. “ it’s probably nerves— “
 
quickly walking up, she stared at the camera in her hands, hitting the top of it a few times with the heel of her hand a few times, before—
 
“ ACK! “
 
oh. great. she should’ve been paying attention. because maybe then she would notice the caved in broken floorboards at the top of the stairs. her shoe caught the edge of the top stair, and she panicked, the shock tilting her backwards and nearly tumbling down.
 
she would’ve, if it wasn’t for the fact that she felt something grab the front of her shirt.
 
“ are you- alright? “",1
"When Yohan came to, the first thing he saw was his brother lying beside him, unconscious. Panic shot up his veins in that instant, seeped into his brain, then clouded his mind. He had little to no recollection what happened next, just that he needed to get his brother out of there.
Hyung. Hyung. Hyung.
When Yohan reached the mansion and frantically patched up the wound on the man's back, it's only then did he realize that his brother's already dead, and before him lied the man with his brother's face. His heart stuttered, hands faltered, mind puzzled, at the harsh truth. And when Elijah looked at Kim Gaon and then at him with that distraught expression, Yohan felt like he'd betrayed her, like he's the one who'd robbed her of her parents and life forever.
Elijah. I'm so sorry, Elijah.
When Yohan fell asleep that one night, the fire didn't haunt his dream for once. Instead, he found himself in the room, standing next to where Kim Gaon was resting. But it's not Kim Gaon lying in the bed. His heart clenched and his stomach churned at the face covered with blood and ashes. And when his brother spoke, breathing became increasingly hard for Yohan until he jerked awake in the dark bedroom, body soaked with sweat and face wet with tears.
“You think you can fix everything, Yohan-ah?”
He couldn't. Of course, he couldn't. So when Yohan forced himself to check up on Kim Gaon's condition came morning, he couldn't find it in him to meet his eyes, especially when Kim Gaon looked at and spoke to him kindly and without suspicion for the first time.“Well, I suppose I should thank you for treating me these past few days, bujang-nim.”“Mm,” Yohan said, then left in disarray.",1

"The night was as silent as the ocean's deep abyss. Parked by a building was a car. From outside, nothing could be heard except the muffled moans of Teccho on the front seat and a silhouette of him struggling and shivering could be seen through the window.
Teccho's face was burning red; his eyes were tightly shut. The blind soldier Saigiku, was hiding under the dashboard sucking the other's penis. They were getting impatient so they decided to pound inside Teccho's car. Well, it's late at night, who would even do this in the very late hour other than the Hunting Dogs ensemble?
""Jouno..."" Teccho called. He hoped that he would never get used to the feeling of Jouno's cold mouth on his penis. It was both enjoyable for them.
If Saigiku would dive down deeper, then he would presumingly cough. It was uncomfortable kneeling down under the driver's seat but having a penis in his mouth is distracting. He was licking, kissing and sucking away as Teccho moaned his name out.
Teccho let out a loud moan as Saigiku got his mouth filled with semen. The blind soldier stood up to straddle over the other's lap, opened his mouth and poured half of the semen on his mouth. He swallowed the rest of the half and began kissing him with heat. He felt his own buttocks get massaged by the other soldier.
""Jouno."" Teccho broke the kiss. ""Not here.""
""Huh?""
""If I make a stain here, they'll think that I made the stain. But I know where we can go."" He opened the door and got out of the car to hide behind a nearby bush.
They'd make out first by kissing each other's bodies and lips. They were both heated with passion as they were feeling impatient for making love. Soon, the dead night would be filled with two soldiers moaning, groaning, huffing and their skin slapping. Teccho was thrusting Saigiku on face-to-face. He was going a little harder than what he wanted but he loved Saigiku so much.
Saigiku's throat was in mild pain as he screamed Teccho's name. He knew once this is over, he will be in his bored state again. But for now, he will feel the absolute bliss in his body.
""Don't stop, Teccho.""
Teccho was thrusting Saigiku with full force, nibbling his shoulder as well.
""Teccho,"" Saigiku moaned as he felt his prostate gland being abused by the other soldier's penis. ""I-I'm gonna-"" he cried out as he ejaculated.
Teccho grunted as he ejaculated deep inside the blind soldier. He ejaculated so much it was leaking out of him and onto his legs.
Teccho pulled out and said,""Was that too much?""
""No… it's fine. I love it."" Saigiku replied.
The two of them kissed again and suddenly a tiny hand tugged the blind soldier's hair causing them to break the kiss and turn around. What popped through the bush was Teruko and her hand holding the flashlight. She was told to find the two missing soldiers and she did not expect them have an intercourse in the bush.
""Oh no! Not again!"" Teruko squealed.",1
"Lance felt the water as it kept driftin up to his feet. It had been a long time since he'd seen an ocean like this, and that place was on earth. However this time the water felt different. It looked the same as the water on earth, felt the same. But there was one difference, it wasn't home. He'd known that he was homesick, Everyone were.
As he looked down to his feet, he felt himself crying. Tears dropping to the ocean of this lonely planet. Was he selfish for wanting to leave everything he had here in space to go back home? To his ocean, not this copycat of an ocean. He wanted to feel the salty water that he used to swim in since a child. He even missed the sharks that used to hunt fishes there in the water that he were scared of. If only the ocean could tell him. His mother used to say that if don't know what to do, ask the ocean as it'll know exactly what to do.oh, how he missed his mother. he misses her hugs, her food and most of all, her voice. If only he could hear it again just once. Ihateschool",1
"It had stood out to Vio almost immediately. From the moment he pretended to defect to Shadow’s side, he seemed to hang around him like he was reluctant to let him out of his sight. It could have simply been the fact that Shadow trusted no one and wanted to keep an eye on him, but his actions seemed to hint at another reason. As did the constant casual touches; on his arms, his shoulders, pale fingers constantly reaching out to make contact with clothing but never skin.It reminded Vio somewhat of Red, but if he had been trying to hold back. Or maybe Blue if he needed to touch the others but couldn’t bring himself to do it properly. It was then that he realized how badly Shadow craved contact but feared it at the same time.That evening, looking out over Death Mountain together, Vio had taken his chance to test his theory. His hand surreptitiously brushed against Shadow’s as he leaned against the window ledge, gazing out over their domain. He pretended not to notice the way Shadow flinched back, recoiling from him as though the contact burned, only to carefully replace his hand in almost the same spot like he was hoping Vio would do it again.It was late that night, exhausted and shaken from the destruction he had watched befall the forests and villages under Shadow’s command, when Vio decided to act. Horrified though he was about his dark counterpart’s disregard for life, he knew there was more to Shadow than his thirst for destruction. He was a part of the heroes too. He was already letting down his guard; targeting an obvious weak point and using it to confuse and distract him would absolutely shatter his defenses, giving Vio the chance he needed to do what he had to do.He wondered if he was more disgusted with Shadow or with himself.“That was fun,” Shadow commented with a grin, stretching both arms over his head as he straightened up on the dragon’s back. He leaped, landing almost soundlessly on the balcony beside which the beast was hovering. “Still, we can’t destroy everything too fast. What’s the point of ruling if there’s nobody left to fear you?”“That’s a good point,” Vio responded, positioning his feet carefully on the beast’s back as he prepared to jump. He cleared the gap easily and landed beside Shadow, stumbling at the impact. In an instant his hand had come up and grasped hold of Shadow’s.Shadow stiffened immediately as Vio regained his balance and straightened up. He glanced briefly at their joined hands as though surprised, then at Shadow’s face. “Sorry.” Carefully he relaxed his grip but didn’t withdraw, watching intently for any sign he might have pushed too far and lost his chance.Shadow’s fingers tightened around his, sharpened nails pressing into skin.Vio let his eyes drift to their hands again before he spoke abruptly. “Shadow, I wanted to say thank you. Without you I never would have realized my true potential. I feel like you’re the only one I can call a friend.”“A friend?” Shadow repeated, still looking thoroughly distracted by the hand in his own.“Yes. I’m glad we can rely on each other.” He brought up his other hand, briefly clasping Shadow’s between both of his own, before letting go. Pointed fingernails scraped pleadingly against the back of his hand as he let it drop and began to walk away into the tower.“Wait.”A flicker of a smile crossed his face briefly before he turned, raising an eyebrow. Shadow caught up, fingers hovering uncertainly over Vio’s hand for a moment before he slipped his hand into his light counterpart’s again. “Me too. I mean, I’m glad you came to your senses. I didn’t want to have to kill you too.”His breathing was shallow as he held on tightly, standing closer to Vio than he had all night. The purple-clothed Hylian raised his other eyebrow. “Are you all right?”“… Mm.” Tentatively Shadow leaned against his side. They stayed like that for a moment before he abruptly seemed to pull himself together and let go, taking a step back. “I’m tired. We may as well get some rest if we’re going to be finishing off those other two heroes tomorrow.”Vio caught a glimpse of the moisture clinging to Shadow’s eyelashes as he spun away. He strode quickly into the tower and Vio followed, knowing that he would be left alone for the rest of the night. All of the pieces were now in place for the final part of his plan.And he hated himself for it.",1
"|Seungmin-ah, do you want to go on a date with me or with Minho? |

 

 

Seungmin has to blink a few times as he processes the question, a niggling feeling at the back of his mind telling him that he’s forgetting something. 
 

He looks up from his phone and his eyes land on Minho who’s slumped on the opposite end of the couch. He's engrossed in his phone, probably watching cute cat videos on YTShorts, eyes drooping from listlessness. 
 

Seungmin kicks his shin. 
 

“OW! What the fuck?!” he jumps, jolting up to sit straight. He levels Seungmin with a glare that promises generations of pain and suffering, his anger exuding from him in waves. “

Seungmin-ah. 

Do you wanna 

die?” 

he asks, a cloying smile on his face despite the venom in his tone. 
 

Seungmin mirrors his expression, eyes narrowing into slits and lips pulled in a taut arch, and immediately Minho’s fury falters. “

Minho-yah. 

Do 

you 

wanna die?” 
 

His boyfriend looks puzzled now, lips pulled in a confused pout. “What?” 
 

Seungmin sighs, exasperated and frankly, 

offended. 

Their rare off day in literal ages and his dumbass boyfriend doesn’t even remember his own promises. He looks back to his phone and decides to react to the question on bubble with an angry emoji before turning it off and shifting on the couch. He disentangles his legs from Minho’s, the man still regarding him with a wary glare, and crawls over to him until he’s straddling him, pinning the other down into the couch. Minho's hands shot up to grab his waist on reflex. 
 

Seungmin leans down until his lips are practically touching Minho’s reddening ears and speaks with an exhale. “You’re forgetting something, 

baby.” 

He enunciates the nickname on purpose—knows it’ll get on Minho’s nerves since he hates being called sappy terms of endearment. 
 

“And what exactly am I forgetting, 

jagi?” 

 

He’s also very aware of how Seungmin hates the same thing. 
 

Two can play that game. 
 

“

Yeobo,” 

Seungmin whines, collapsing on top of Minho and smushing against him. He can practically hear the eye-roll in his sigh. “You promised me a date.” he speaks into his collarbone, melting into the arms Minho wrapped around his middle. 
 

“That’s it?” 
 

Seungmin pulls back with a scandalized gasp and pinches Minho’s arm when he doesn’t even attempt to bite back his laughter. 
 

“That’s 

it?! 

Fuck it, I'm filing for a divorce.” 
 

Minho throws his head back on unhinged cackles and tightens his hold on Seungmin. “We’d need to be married first, Seungmo.”
 

Seungmin glares. “We’ll get married and then divorce right after.” 
 

Minho gasps, dramatic and cheesy, with a hand on his mouth and everything. “Are you 

proposing 

right now?” His eyes are wide and glittering, the embodiment of awestruck and over-the-top joy. Before Seungmin can rebut, however, his face drops into a blank stare. “Cause my answer is no.” 
 

“Fuck you-” Seungmin pinches both Minho’s cheeks, pulling them hard enough that he knows it hurts as he laughs at Minho’s ear-piercing banshee screeches. 
 

“

Kim Seungmin.” 

Minho grits, words garbled from Seungmin’s juvenile assault. He deliberately squeezes Seungmin’s ass in retaliation, though all that achieves is making Seungmin regard him with a self-satisfied smirk. 
 

“Yah, you tryna distract me with sex? Not happening 

jagi, 

we’re going on that date.” 
 

“Ugh,” Minho groans, imbued with all the misery and suffering he endures in the hands of his cruel boyfriend. “I hate you.”
 

Seungmin chuckles, cupping both of Minho’s cheeks as he leans his face closer. “And now you’re gonna have to pay for everything, hyungie.” 
 

“Oh 

please

, as if I don’t do that already.” he grumbles.
 

“Hmm~ I love you.” He pecks him on the lips, pulling back with a soft grin. 
 

“You suck.” Minho says, opening his eyes and frowning at his boyfriend. 
 

“How very mature you are, my boyfriend who’s two whole centuries older than I am.” 
 

“Yah!” Minho swiftly flips their positions, tackling Seungmin onto the couch and weighing down on him. Seungmin squirms under him, complaining about how he can’t breathe. “I’ll dropkick you into the 24
th
 century and then we’ll see who’s old.” 
 

“You can do whatever you want after our 

date.” 

Seungmin smirks at him.
 

“Ugh, fine, I expect you to be ready in fifteen minutes.” Minho relents, head lolling and nose brushing against Seungmin’s. Seungmin loops his arms around his neck and pulls him into a deep kiss. 
 

“Where’re we going?” he asks once they separate. 
 

“It’s a surprise.” Minho grins, giving him one last peck before taking off towards his room. 
 

Seungmin follows, anticipation bubbling in his belly. He thinks of the bubble post and mentally thanks the OP for unintentionally reminding him of their date.",1

"Toya adores his partner.It wasn't an uncommon thought before they'd started dating and it certainly isn't now.He adores him on lazy mornings where he'd wake up before Akito did, he'd bask in the small slits of warm sun peeking through their blinds and sigh softly as he traced imaginary patterns across the others back.He adores him in the moments after when he'd his teeth by his side, eyes still half-lidded with the curse of sleep, hair a tangled mess of a cozy night snuggled against his lover.He adores him in the kitchen where he becomes a bit bossy to be entirely honest. The way he'd watch quietly, his hands tensing as he tried to resist before lightly pushing the other boy away from the stove top, brows knitted in concentration as he focused on cooking breakfast despite whining that he had been too tired mere moments before.He adores him at the dining table where he'd messily stuff his face full of whatever meal they decided to have and Toya would have to reach over and gently dab off any leftover food that scattered over his lips. It's a habit he's embarrassed about but Toya loves him nonetheless.He adores him even when he whined when Toya announces he has to leave for work, making the face of a kicked puppy as if he wouldn't return like he does every day.He adores the way he asked ""Aren't you forgetting something?"" only for Toya to swivel around and give him a kiss on his perfect nose, soft cheeks, and lips. The way he still got flustered after all these years and muttered a soft, ""I-I meant your keys…""He adores the way he'd always left little text messages every few hours while he waited for him to get home. Small messages reminding him to eat or just life updates about how he'd fallen over while walking or what he'd heard latest from Ena's art career.He adores the way he'd try to be subtle, (but always fail under Toya's observant view,) to act like he didn't perk up like a dog at the sound of his partner coming home. The way he'd softly ask ""How was work?"" Always prepared with a response that'd make him feel whole and comforted whether it was a good or bad day.He adores how he'd still sing as he cooked dinner, body swaying to his own beat. It'd been long since they'd surpassed RAD WEEKEND, but that didn't mean he or their friends had stopped music at all. It just happened to take a backseat for the moment as other details of life took priority. And yet, it still seeped out of every part of Akito.He adores how they'd get ready for bed together, taking a show before. He'd run his hands through Akito's hair with a content smile, eyes softening with pure, unabashed love for the man before him, fingers working against his scalp and between ginger locks in gentle strokes.He adores the night sky as it casts over them while he dragged Akito to bed with him, even as he complained he's not tired. He was starkly aware of his partner's struggle with insomnia, but he didn't mind. He was here to help, and to love, and to forever cherish every aspect of Akito that said man couldn't about himself.He adores the slow heartbeat as he laid against Akito's chest like a loving rhythm that lulled him into a comfortable sleep knowing the one who kept him safe and warm would always be by his side.He adores that, despite how grumpy he can seem on the outside, he pressed a kiss to his temple so delicately as if he'd break apart like glass. It was a gesture of so much care and unspoken words of needing to protect one another.And as he falls asleep, he adores how they will do it all again tomorrow. He will continue to cherish and love the partner that he was given because Akito is nothing but pure love itself.
I want to hold the sun in my hands

And tell it a thousand times over, I Love You.",1
"He had decided it the first night after the Van Eck job was done. Alone in his room in the top of the Slat he sat with a bottle of brandy. He could master this, if for no reason other than for her. “I will have you without your armor Kaz Brekker or I will not have you at all” those were the words she had said to him aboard the Ferolind. He wanted her, and she wanted him but only without his armor. He could do that. He took off his gloves and tossed them on the desk. He could best this. He remembered the last time he had tried. He felt a wave of sickness run through him as the memory of Beni’s flesh passed through his mind, then Jordie’s, bloated, greying, and cold. So cold. The water was rising around him. He grabbed for his cane. The familiar weight a reassurance. He took a swig of brandy. It made him feel warm. He took another swig. He thought of those stolen minutes in the bathroom of the Geldrenner. The look on Inej’s face as he had said those awful things when he had recoiled, overcome by this sickness and his hate. What if he couldn’t do this, he was going to fail her. He felt the waters rising around his legs. He growled and took another swig of brandy. He wouldn’t fail. He had never failed. Not in the Ice Court job, not in taking down Van Eck, and not in taking down Pekka Rollins. The water was cold around his leg and all he could see was the cold empty look in Jordie’s eyes. But he had earned his revenge for Jordie. He braced himself on his cane, he thought of Pekka bent on his knees in front of his crew begging Kaz. And it made the memory of Jordie’s gaze easier. I brought you vengeance brother. But the water did not recede. Kaz was no longer drowning but he could not pull away. He took another swig of brandy desperate to feel warm. He turned and stared at his windowsill, the one Inej used to sit on and feed crows from. He was going to miss that. Then suddenly the memory that came to him as the baleen had run out returned to him now, Inej's on that very sill feeding the crows  “You shouldn’t make friends with crows,” he’d told her. “Why not?” she had asked. “They don’t have any manners.” He had said, it wasn’t very funny but she had laughed, that beautiful sound reverberated through his mind and then the water receded. His knuckles were white on his cane and he was sweaty but he was in his room in the Slat. He had done it, he had faced the memory and didn’t flinch. It wasn’t nearly the same as feeling skin but it was a first step. He could do this. For her and with her.He’d continued trying to practice not wearing his gloves around the Slat, it’s the only place he felt comfortable enough doing it, and besides that way there would be no hit to the rumors about his hands. He started simple, dealing one night at cards, gloves off. When he had come down with them in his pocket and not on everyone had stared but no one had said a word. They were happy to have him play cards with him, and no one tried to touch him. The second time he did it Anika’s hand had touched his as he reached to take her cards. He had to bite down on his tongue to stop the tremor from visibly running through his body and he felt the water around his legs as he sat around the table, all the noises becoming muddled and deafened. “It’s not easy for me either” that’s what she’d said. He thought of her, and the water receded some. He had turned in after that hand, and if anyone noticed anything they didn’t say. He slept that night with his gloves on. But each day for the next week he spent some time with his gloves off in the presence of others.",1
"A Toast to Victory.It didn’t really hit her until that moment.Surrounded by heroes, her world began to crack as her new friends laughed and basked in the glory of their shared accomplishments. The feast before them was in full swing, everyone sat leisurely around the stage while they celebrated the successful rescue of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the reinstatement of General Mahamatra, and the overthrow of the sages.A sharp pain pierced within her chest, like a spear that lay dormant had just solidified inside of her lungs. Lumine inhaled sharply, only loud enough for her fairy friend to notice and tilt her head in concern. The traveller nodded numbly as she let Paimon believe that the remedy for this sudden change was more delicious food. Her little friend floated away to select the most mouth-watering morsels to bring back to her travelling partner.Lumine let her gaze sweep the room as the pain in her chest grew into a throbbing ache and bloated into her stomach. Her initial response was to find someone who could understand, someone to reach out to and have her fears squashed, but as she looked over her friends – Paimon, Dunyarzad, Dehya, Nilou, Cyno, Alhaitham – that pain inside her turned black and began to drag talons along her ribcage.The grief of watching the world around her go on as if Greater Lord Rukkhadevata never existed would not have been as horrendous if she could open up and share this pain, address it and discuss it with someone. If they could just hear her recount of what happened, whether they thought her insane or took her story into consideration, would at the very least satisfy the sorrow of losing yet another person on her travels. It would stop the growing beast within her from tearing at her heart, and if she acted quick enough then maybe it would be vanquished all together before it utterly consumed her.She felt the monster within her seep into her throat and her eyes unfocused to the space in front of her. Even Lesser Lord Kusanali – Nahdia, so full of curiosity and wisdom – was someone she could not confide this truth in. They had fought so hard to rid the world of the infection of Forbidden Knowledge, surely if Lumine were to voice the truth it would just bring the poison back to Irminsul again and the Greater Lord’s sacrifice would have been for nought.The taste of blood drifted to her attention and Lumine realised she had been biting the inside of her mouth below her lip. She let her tongue run over the wound as she was pulled out of her spiralling and her resolve began to form.Her golden gaze, now dripping with sorrow, returned to caress the sight of her friends again. They were happy. Merriment and a lazy, relaxed kind of joy fizzed in the air like a blanket of warmth that she could no longer take comfort in. The reality of her situation caressed her mind like a cruel lover making her watch as the beast within her chest dulled its claws but refused to let go, settling into its new nest to stay.Memories of all the times she had felt content along her travels, the kind of happiness that had made her feel like she had a home among her friends, began to be tainted as they replayed in her mind. The wicked voice in her ear breathed taunts of how utterly naïve and stupid she had been to believe that those moments were hers to cherish. The moments themselves had been the ones to own her – had been the ones to sweetly pull her away from the very reason she was travelling across this world in the first place. The voice laughed at her and forced her to watch as each memory was polluted and shattered under this new perspective.Lumine’s reality changed before her very eyes and the monster in her chest purred at the bitterness that swam in her head.With one last glance around the room, the smiles of her friends being cemented to a new bittersweet meaning, she turned her back to the group and slipped away from the stage like an unnoticed shadow. Her ultimate goal of finding her sibling was her main focus once again, as it should have been the entire time.The heels on her boots clicked softly as her feet met the pavement outside of the Grand Bazaar. Gripping the strap of her backpack tighter, the traveller made her way towards the Sanctuary of Surasthana to seek the next clue of her brother’s whereabouts with new determination. His memory now held the promise of comfort from the beast within her – surely she would be able to spill all her pains and troubles to him and then she would be rid of this creature under her skin.A tear slipped down her stone-cold expression as she glanced back at the now closed door behind her. From now on, she would distance herself from those she couldn’t risk tainting with the Forbidden Knowledge – from those she believed she couldn’t open up to ever again.Whether it was the monster in her chest, the poisonous voice in her ear or her new resolve itself, a decision was made; her travels would now be ones of solitude as the risks and potential distractions would only be her downfall.She must find her brother and until then – until they could leave this world – she would be on her own. Perhaps this world would forget her just the same as the once celebrated Lord of Sumeru. Lumine, the revered traveller, would either become nothing but a legend or one who never existed at all. Either way, it was time to go.",1
"Ino came out of the storeroom when she heard the bell on her shop door ring. There had been a new delivery of flowers a few minutes ago and she had to prepare and arrange them for an order. She opened her eyes wide when she saw who this new client was. She never thought she would ever see him in her shop.“Sasuke-kun, can I help you ?”Sasuke turned slightly towards her. She could not see the expression on his face but she knew he was embarrassed. He was not the sort to walk into a flower shop and as far as she could remember, he had never bought flowers. Even if when she was a genin, she would have done anything to see him in her family store. She could not help smiling as she thought back to that time. Things had changed a lot.“I wanted to give Sakura a present. I thought flowers would be a good idea.”He blushed slightly. Ino thought it was sweet of him to want to please Sakura. She deserved to be happy with the man she loved. It had been two months since Sasuke had returned to Konoha. Even if Ino had initially been worried that Sakura would suffer once again because of him, she could see how happy they were together. She was reassured to see them like this.“Do you know what you could offer her ?”Sasuke looked at the flowers carefully. He stopped in front of carnations.“I'll take carnations.”Ino frowned. It was not Sakura's favorite flowers.“Are you sure ?”He nodded.“She had a bunch of carnations at her apartment when I came back. And when we went on a mission, when we were genin, she picked some on the way back.”He smiled slightly. Ino was surprised to see that he remembered a small detail that had taken place many years ago. She knew he had not been wrong. He had chosen with his heart. She took the carnations, prepared them and arranged them in a bouquet. She mixed them with other flowers to give harmony to the bouquet, while asking Sasuke's opinion. He paid and left the store.The next day, Ino went to Sakura's for lunch. She saw the flowers Sasuke had bought in a vase.“Nice bouquet,” Ino said.Sakura blushed and smiled.“Sasuke-kun gave them to me.”She approached and sniffed the flowers. Ino was reassured for her friend. She finally got the happy ending she deserved.

"Natalie stood in front of the coffee machine, humming as she waited for the machine to squeeze the liquid out. The mellow smell is always refreshing. She rocked the cup to let the milk be steamed into fine milk froth, and then covered it on the coffee. She held the cup up to the tip of her nose, took a deep breath, and showed a satisfied smile on her face.She wanted to make another cup for her lover. Her soft blonde hair slipped from her temples, and she raised her hand to comb the hair behind her ears.At this moment, Crypto came over. He leaned against the door frame and saw that the apron outlined Wattson's waistline in a perfect arc —she always wears insulating clothing, so he rarely has the opportunity to appreciate her excellent figure.Crypto took a few steps forward, hugged Wattson from behind, and put his arms around her waist casually. Wattson turned half a circle in his arms, raised her head to kiss his cheek.“Natalie，I am starving.Do you have to do it now？”“Taejoon——”Wattson pushed Park Tae-joon to sit on the chair, stepped on it, and lay on him, with her soft breast squeezed on his chest. Crypto could only hold Wattson's thigh and hug her up.Natalie is always lively and active in sex. In many cases, she wants to have some very close contact with her boyfriend - for example now.Wattson stroked the metal around Crypto's eyes and looked at the eyes blinking slowly. She lowered her head to close to Crypto's chin skin and metal link, stretched out her tongue to lick the crack, then found his lips,given it a gentle touch.The same aroma of coffee was tasted in their mouths.",1

"He’s sweating but he feels very cold. Grabbing the bedsheets tightly feels like too much now, he’s too tired. Like a truck run him over and put him to lay down afterwards.
Eventually, the almost complete silence encourages him to sleep, and he falls into dreams with the noise of the wind hitting the windows as a lullaby.
When he wakes up, he feels somehow lighter. Just a bit. It’s not enough for him to feel strong enough to get up and leave the bed, but at least he feels more conscious. There is, however, a stinging sensation, like he needs to be alert. Something might be wrong.
That sensation almost vanishes when his brother enters the room, greeting him with his ever-present smile. His hair looks perfect, Erik always looks perfect.
“Hey, brother”, he walks over to the bed and moves a chair to sit beside the bed and keep him company.
“How do you feel?”
“Better”, Wille sighs, but it comes to his attention how much his throat hurts. He rubs at it softly, moving his neck left and right. The pain doesn’t leave.
Erik is carrying something, he’s holding it with his hands in a way in which Wille can’t see what it is, but once he lays it down in his lap, Wille can make up a round shape.
Soon enough, Erik takes it into his hands again and shows it to him. “I got you this. A new snow globe”. In it, there are two frogs. One is wearing a scarf and the other one a beanie, and they play in the snow. The scene feels familiar, but Wille can’t pinpoint why.
He makes grabby hands for it like a child, groaning. He feels bad again.
Erik puts it in his hands and gives him a forehead kiss. Then, a proper one, since at first, he was checking his temperature. “You’re very hot, still”.
“I don’t feel well… Thank you for the gift”. Wille tries to shake it in his hands but it slips out of his reach and falls onto the bed. Luckily, it doesn’t break, not even a scratch, as it landed in a soft surface.
His brother laughs at his clumsiness, which is definitely improved by his sickness.
“I’m here, little brother”.
“Erik?”
“Yeah?”
“Erik”.
“I’m in pain too, Wille…”
Erik disappears. He’s gone? He left without letting him know?
Wille gasps and wakes up. Sweat covering his forehead, some falling in his torso and he sits up in bed. It feels like a cold strong hand is grabbing at his heart or twisting his stomach. A punch to the gut. Images of fast cars, an ambulance and sirens, all appear and disappear in his mind. The funeral, the soil on top of the casket, mum’s handkerchief, the condolences and the hugs.
But right now, he’s in his room. His brother is gone. His snow globe isn’t there. A single tear escapes and he feels drained once again. It makes him fall asleep once more. This time, his knuckles white as he’s grabbing the bedsheets, holding on for dear life.When Simon enters the room to check on him, he can see a pained expression on his still soft honey face. He has brought a new clean shirt for his boyfriend. Simon admires his freckles and soft dimples, he’s beautiful even when he’s ill.
He wants to caress his face but is afraid of waking him up. Instead, he pets his hair carefully and slowly. Wille’s fingers let go of the sheets. His whole body loses some of the tension it was carrying, and finally, he sleeps peacefully. No delirium and no pain.Simon falls into bed next to him, curled up, taking as little space as possible, seeming more like a pet than human. He wraps his arms around Wille and matches his breathing to his in a deep, real slumber.",1

"*“Some strange weather out there, Dr. Weir.” Chuck looked up to her from his screen.“How do you mean?”“Might wanna see for yourself.”Her brow furrowed suspiciously before she turned away and slid open the doors to the balcony.“Oh my —“ Her eyes widened in shock at the sight.Snow — flurries of fluffy white snow against the blue evening sky, and in the middle of it her second-in-command trying to stifle his obvious glee.""John…” she began as she stared upwards, at a loss for words. “What — ?”“Cool, isn’t it? McKay found it in one of the labs…” He indicated a curious device sitting against the barrier. “…looks like some sort of weather simulator. See you can switch…” He turned a dial and suddenly they were caught in a whirlwind of rust-colored leaves. Elizabeth narrowed her eyes dangerously. “And you’re certain this technology poses no risk…?”“McKay says it’s totally harmless.” He’d switched back to the snowfall setting, flakes appearing to land in his hair but disappearing instantly on contact. Just an illusion. “Maybe some Ancients just missed the seasonal changes on Earth.”“Hmm.” She moved to stand next to him, her attempt to appear unconvinced not fooling him, and he grinned. “Come onnn, you know you love it — snow for December, without the cold.”“It is beautiful,” she admitted quietly, watching the snow glitter in the golden light. She tilted her head back, regarding the jewel-like stars that had began to appear in the deepening blue sky when something hanging from the glowing beam above them caught her eye.“John…” Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she shot him a glance. “What’s that above us?”“What?” He glanced up quickly, eyes immediately widening. “What the — I didn’t put it there, I swear!”  The mischievous faces of a certain physicist, Athosian, and Satedan as they conspired with the gate tech immediately appeared in his mind’s eye. He grimaced slightly.“Looks like someone told Teyla about certain holiday customs on Earth.” Elizabeth’s eyes locked with his again, though the corners of her mouth twitched into the slightest smirk. “As I understand it, this is basically an Athosian version of mistletoe…”“…and bad fortune may come to those who don’t observe the…customary ritual.” He licked his lips nervously. “Ah well, I’m sure ignoring it wouldn’t pose any real threat…”“Well, I’d rather not take any chances.” She had moved closer, a mischievous expression on her face while she held him in a steady gaze. “…particularly not in this galaxy. Though only if you feel the same, of course…”“What? Uh…yeah…” The realization that this was actually happening sent his mind spinning, and he mentally shook himself, barely stifling the grin that threatened to spread across his face. “Absolutely.”“Good,” she breathed, and with that she closed the gap between them, pulling him into a deep kiss. Deep but languid, her hands in his hair and the snow swirling around them, the soft sigh of the ocean below as they held the kiss till lack of air forced them apart.They faced each other, breathless, and he was struck by her beauty, her face illuminated by the golden light while the snowflakes caught for an instant in her dark hair. He reached out to caress her cheek, finding her smirking again.“Maybe we should do it again,” she murmured, quirking an eyebrow. “…just to be safe.”He grinned back, leaning in close. “Probably for the best,” he whispered, then captured her lips for a second time.*",1

Giving false memories to people who didn’t even know him yet.Yuuji’s thoughts were wearing him down, he’s just so tired. He needs sleep, always moving, always running, no food nor water. It’s so exhausting.With a blink of an eye, Yuuji falls asleep, unintentionally.———Feeling the presence of someone, his eyes shoots open, he sees as familiar figure.“Meg…gumi?” Yuuji says, seeing the pointy dark hair, it’s dark, how long has he been asleep?“Tch, always thinking about him? Pathetic.” The person sounding pissed and familiar.Yuuji then suddenly gets up, hearing that it was sukuna. He remains silent, refusing to even speak to the man.“Aww. Cmon, my love, I didn’t mean to take your little boy toy away” Sukuna says, daring to get closer to Yuuji, his right hand so close to Yuuji’s beautiful scars on Yuuji’s pretty little face.“He’s not my boytoy, he’s the one I love.” Yuuji tries to slap the hand away, but failing as sukuna grips his wrist. Yuuji’s heart pounds in his chest. No! Yuuji doesn’t love Sukuna right? He loves Megumi, and only Megumi.“Are you seriously picking that fushiguro brat over me? Yuuji, YOU love me.” Sukuna hisses.Sukuna sighs.“I’m sorry.” Sounding so genuine. “Yuuji, I’m sorry, please love ME. You promised we’d ruled the world together. Im sorry, I love you.”Seeing this made it so unnatural, the king of curses apologizing? Unreal. The king of curses confesses his love? Unreal.“Marry me again, yuuji” oh so desperate. Yuuji doesn’t believe it, his heart flutters at those words.“You- you. Your just lying, manipulating me? I’m not that dumb sukuna! Just let me go!” He’s so weak. It’s so cruel, he hates it, he still loves the horrible horrible curse.Sukuna does actually let go, he gets on his knee, “I’m sorry I was aggressive, I’m just mad, you love me right not the damn black haired brat?” He takes Yuuji’s left hand and kisses the ring finger. Yuuji flushes, his heart beating, he can’t betray Megumi, he can’t.Yuuji is confused, yuuji is tired, yuuji is frightened.He felt his knees weak with all the sudden comfort, he needed it, his eyes started to water, he’s a man yet he’s being so emotional. It’s tiring.“Fuck off. I love Megumi.”“I’ll still love you. I’ll make you mine again.”Oh why cant Yuuji’s heart choose one, he loves them both.Yuuji collapses on Sukunas body.“I’ll ask you one more time, will you marry me?” Sukuna asks the question.“Oh dear.” Yuuji breaths, “If I marry you… I’ll betray my friends, my senpais, my sensei, jujutsu tech, my morals-“ he sucks up some more air, little droplets fall down his face. “I’ll betray him.”“If I don’t, I betray my soul, my heart”“He is are very dear to me, Sukuna.” It’s true without a doubt that Megumi is important to him.“Dearer than me?” Sukuna asks.“Oh no.. no, not dearer than you.” Yuuji responds.Sukuna deeply chuckles.———Yuuji’s in a room, laying down on a futon. His bottom half stripped away from him, love making with sukuna.“Haaaaah… haah.. wait!-“ Yuuji moans, it’s not the first time he’s making love, but he’s not used to it.“Shut.. up, you feel so fucking good.” Sukuna groans at the tightness, rocking his hips, the tip left then shoving it deep repeatedly. “Ah! Sukuuuuunaa!” His prostate being hit multiple times.“Ki.. kiss! Please..! Kunaaa” Yuuji gasps, feeling so good, comfort, warmth, he needed this, to feel loved, to be reassured. Incoherent words leaving Yuuji’s mouth.Sukuna nibbles on Yuuji’s bottom lip to do Yuuji’s request of kissing, each others tongue swirling around, drool comes out of Yuuji’s mouth, everything is a haze.It feels so good.———“Run, leave.”  Yuuji hears his lover, Megumi fight for control of his body. It breaks him seeing like that.“I love you.”Yuuji lied, sukuna isn’t dearer than everything.In the middle of the night, he leaves, he runsagain.",1
"""Fuck this,"" Chuuya spits for no one to hear. He is driving at a speed he will surely get in trouble for, but what is he? A normal civilian? Hah.If he was a normal civilian, maybe he would not have gone through everything he did. Such as losing all his friends, for eternity or not. Or bleeding out to the point he is sure he will die.Or losing Dazai.Chuuya wants to laugh. It is not like Dazai is not here anymore. He is still here, and in fact, happier than ever. That part hurts the most. Chuuya wonders if there is ever a day where Dazai felt happy with him, after all they have done together.Have the arcade meetings and sleepovers ever meant anything to Dazai? When someone asks him who is his best friend, would he say it is Chuuya? Or would he say the name of one of him damned colleagues now?This―this anger, this sadness―has been going on for years already, but Chuuya feels none of them subsiding.He is sure he will go home only to lament about the past he shares with Dazai into the nothingness, hoping the silence can comfort him. Because wine and alcohol have worn off their effects now.Chuuya jolts up, realising he is heading for the tree beside the road. Fuck.He must have gotten too engrossed in his feelings. He aggressively turns the wheel, hoping to save himself and not die in such an anti-climatic way for someone in the mafia. Thankfully, his car changes directions and he is safe. He has not even thought of using his Ability to save himself, but oh well.He continues the rest of his trip home in silence, without thinking of Dazai, fearing that he might almost crash his car again.When he is home, however, he lets his thoughts run wild. He hates everything now that Dazai left him. He hates how he will come running back to Dazai if he ever asked. He hates how he is even thinking of Dazai, even now.He hates how that despite everything, despite how he should hate Dazai, he still loves him.",1
"“Heads up.”

Koi looks up to see a washcloth flying at him, and he deftly catches it with one hand before using it to dry off the jug in his hand. It’s after-hours at the tavern, and the only sounds that can be heard are the clinking of cups being dried and bottles being rearranged. An old jukebox in the corner of the tavern, usually surrounded by drunk patrons, plays smooth jazz, and the entire place is settled within a soft orange glow that he has come to associate with home. 

With 

Ann. 


The Twi’lek in mention is grinning at him from over the bar, having finished his job of wiping down the tables in the main room. In his hand is a glass that Koi identifies as one he’d 

just 

dried, half-filled with a honey-gold drink of some sort. He gives Ann a look, and the other man only takes a sip in return. 

“Nice catch.”

Koi sets down the jug in his hand and slings the cloth over his shoulder, leaning on the edge of the bar and in towards Ann. “What, you thought I wouldn’t catch it?”

From this position, Koi is able to look up at his boyfriend through his lashes, weaponizing a gaze that he knows Ann can’t resist. A faint blush rises in Ann’s cheeks and Koi has to bite his lower lip to keep his victorious grin under control. 

“No,” Ann pauses to brush back a strand of Koi’s hair, and he sneakily slides a hand towards his cup while his boyfriend is distracted. “I always have full faith in you.”

His fingers close around the rim of Ann’s cup and Koi pulls it out of his grasp. The other man barely notices, just tipsy enough to keep his eyes fixated on Koi. He takes a cautious sip from it before scrunching his face at the taste. Ann lets out an amused huff at Koi’s misfortune, and he shoots him a playful glare. 

“

Maker, 

what drink is this?” The liquor leaves an overwhelmingly sweet taste in Koi’s mouth, and he dumps the offending drink down the sink. Ann walks around the bar to join Koi behind it, snickering as he washes out his mouth.

“It’s an experimental drink, I guess,” Ann’s shoulders are thoroughly shaking with the effort of trying not to laugh out loud. “You don’t like it?”

“I think this might be the only drink of yours that I actually hate.” Koi leans his head back as Ann wraps his arms around his waist, pulling him flush against his body. His head drops to Koi’s shoulder, and he sways them gently as the music on the jukebox changes. Koi wipes away a stray droplet of water from his mouth as Ann’s lekku curls lovingly over his clavicle.

“We dancing?” The mood has suddenly shifted into something softer, more romantic, and Koi feels slightly out of place. Ann only hums into his shoulder, oblivious to his internal struggle. 

“Up to you, 

eswo.”

 

Koi sighs and leans fully into the man behind him. “You know I have two left feet. I’m not suited for slow dancing.” 

Ann hums and the hold around his waist gets tighter. “I disagree. You’re one of the best I’ve ever danced with.”

“Have you danced with many people?” Koi’s question is said jokingly, but there’s a trace of insecurity intertwined with his words. 

“A few,” Ann says quietly. “None as handsome as you, though.” 

The red-hot blush in Koi’s cheeks is impossible to hide, and he tries to play it off as an alcohol flush. “I bet you say that to all the boys, huh?”

Abruptly, he’s spun around to face Ann, and a big hand slides up to hold his face. “Only you, Koi.” 

His tone is so genuine and full of truth, that Koi doesn’t know how to respond. He attempts to laugh it off, but Ann doesn’t let him. “You know that, right? Only you. It’ll only ever be you.” 


This sounds an awful lot like an “I love you,” 

Koi wants to say, but he restrains himself. “You’re drunk,” he says instead.

“Maybe.” Ann shrugs his shoulders, but the heavy hand on his waist never moves. “Does it make what I say less true?”

There’s a moment of silence as Koi takes in his words. “I guess not,” he says eventually. A thumb brushes over his heated cheek, and Koi’s eyes flutter close at the touch. He feels Ann kiss his hairline, then his cheekbone, and finally the corner of his lips. 

“Let’s go upstairs, 

eswo. 

It’s late.” 

Koi follows Ann upstairs, with the cloth still haphazardly slung over his shoulder. The jukebox keeps playing its smooth tunes. The unfinished cups are still stacked beside the sink. 

Hand in hand with his boyfriend, Koi couldn’t care less about any of those things.",1
"Hey, I say, with the intention of taking your hand by the strings.When you turned your back to me, you used the endless winds to propel you: you fled from freedom, rejecting the hearth and the fiery heart to paint your fists with blood.When you came back, you turned to face me. The breeze welcomed you home and has stayed by your side ever since. Every time you feel a shove pressing you closer to your brother, and there’s a song in your throat, urging you to unlock your jaw and breach the chasm of silence – that’s the wind.Every time you imagine fingers locking around your wrist in the instant before you shake me awake… that’s the wind. When there’s a song in your throat and a tattoo beating beneath your skin, your heart falling into tempo with mine as our gazes brush – that’s the wind. Hey, I say, with the hope that you will teach me what I’m looking for.When I turned my back to you, you raised your claymore and brought the fire. Every Abyss Mage burned to ash. You kept my back to you, but not once did you let harm come to me, swinging and slashing and striking like a knight out of memory.When I came back from my visit to Stormterror’s Lair – each and every time, truthfully – you turned to face me. The crest of your smile touched my cheek and now keeps the warmth with me, a moment I can feel becoming memory.Every time I feel a shove pushing me toward the Cathedral, and there’s a huff of laughter behind me, an urging to step forward and put myself in the hands of the believers – that’s your belief.Every time I imagine my hand locking around your wrist when you shake me awake, that’s my desire. When there’s a song in my throat and a tempo dancing along my body, your silence falling into mine as we resemble each other – that’s your belief. Hey, you say, with the intention of dragging me out of the past, planting me right in the present.When you settled against my shoulder, you dropped your temple to the crown of my head and handed me your weight. Though I huffed and puffed and complained, you trusted me to keep you aloft. With the wind at our backs, we became weightless; with your belief in my pocket, the moment crystallised.When I returned to Angel’s Share for the umpteenth time – every day, let’s not lie – you raised your hand in greeting. I kept my true feelings sealed behind my lips, things I could not name; nevertheless, you treated me just the same, passing me drinks and rolling your eyes at my stories.Every time your naked fingers brush my palm and there’s an electricity, I’m not sure what to call this. There’s a beloved, well-worn, and unextinguished love in my heart, always yearning for the one I see in the mirror.Every time I blow air across the bridge of your nose, you scowl, failing to hide the quirk in your mouth. You’re not sure what to call this. There’s a beloved, well-worn, and unrepaired crack in your heart, a hurt you will possess for the rest of your life.There are some things that cannot be repaired. There are some pains that make us, that shape us, become the foundation of the people we are still becoming.I won’t ever try to fix you. You won’t ever tell me I’m more than enough. You won’t lie to me.Every time you turn to face me, the wind will welcome you home. Every time you turn your back to Mondstadt, the breeze will be there to guide your journey wherever you may go.When you come back to me, say  Hey, like you mean to tell me the flighty bard is enough.When I put my hands on you, framing your arms and smiling up at you, let me say  Hey:   Hey,  with the intention of showing you formless love can take across centuries, encapsulated in a syllable. Hey, I tell you.You smirk at me and you say,  Hey yourself. Incomprehensibly everything.",1
